CARD: Sorting lists in API and manage Favs
DESC: This should be alphabetical like web site.  Ideally even Favs is sorted and even removable list?

‌

See below.  I think Favs should be managable, renameable… Just a normal list that is created when user is created.

I think the API determines the sort order for this, but need to confirm with grigory?  It should be alphabetical also

CARD: Add Native Paypal and stripe options (and get rid of WP billing)
DESC: See below.  For stripe and paypal we don’t want monthly.  4-months and yearly.  I am not sure we could do this without moving all our existing paypal stripe subscriptions to our native code.  We should first probably move all app subscriptions to native if they are not all there.  Below is what I think we should do.  We could break these into seperate Trello cards.

‌

1. Move all manual users to native including adding new roles.  Lifetime users…
2. Move all app users to native
3. Create Discount Code feature
4. Move all paypal users to native and change current paypal purchase to native
5. Move all stripe users and change native stripe purchase to native at the same time.
6. Delete all WP subscriptions

DESC: Or what do you think if we just moved this into the main api or into a consolidated third party connector?  We should all discuss this but I know Alin likes way less services and I can see advantages to less services as well.  Think about it.  Maybe we should define like 5 projects

1) Main API (move CJ here)
2) Main Web (move CJ here)
3) ThirdParty Connectors
4) Mobile App

CARD: This user cancelled in google but his plan stayed premium
DESC: userId: 62284

I cancelled it manually.

Can’t we call an api some how and check?

‌

My guess is we have 50-100 people like this.  We could always cancel everyone that we think is like this, put a note on the site for them, and if they use the app check the status and send an update back to us.

CARD: OE Warmup (Garmin)
DESC: 1. By default turn it on
2. Coach Jack has Zone 2 workout is 56 minutes of warmup and 4 minutes of cool down.  Maximum warmup length should be 20 minutes for any workout.  In this case the from 20-56 minutes should be X-Y%  If it is zone 2 it could be +-10% or you could set a zone specific target, zone2 or zone 3… what ever is easiest.  Probably +-10% is best.

I made a copy of the workout just so you could see the one I had.  I am not sure if the copy is still considered a CJ workout.
