CARD: Billing - failed credit cards should not immediately remove their access + send event to event_tracker api
DESC: If status is “suspended” we should give them 3 days before we set the status to  “failed payment.”  On the UI we should show instead of suspended.  Show

Failed Payment - Still Active
Failed Payment - Not Active

They should be able to change credit card or re-try credit card at this time so take them to the standard checkout page with some different messaging.


The button below should say
Re-Try or Fix Card

CARD: Billing Step 1
DESC: So we are using [authorize.net](http://authorize.net "‌") for billing but they only allow credit card based billing but we can “hack it” so that we add our manual payments.

They take care of all the credit card stuff, customer profiles and automatic subscriptions.  We just need to add these features

1. Create new Customer/Subscription
2. Update Subscription (Yearly>Monthly or Monthy>Yearly) with prorating (we need to figure out how to pro-rate.)
3. Cancel Subscription
4. Create subscription from apple/google.
5. Cancel subscription from apple/google.
6. Expire subscription on failed payments
7. Expire subscription for all manual payments after cancellation (credit card payments this should happen automatically)

‌

So when we have credit card payments we will have subscription records but first we can just look at the customer description to see if it starts with Apple, Google, or Manual.  If it starts with one of those then they are automatically active.  If not we can look at subscription status.  Currently we are looking at the status in Mongo, maybe this is best and we just look at webhooks that update mongo.  If I can go in and just edit a customer in [authorize.net](http://authorize.net "‌") and say “expired” instead of manual, or if I cancel the subscription.  Seems best if I can just do all user managment from a[uthorize.net.](http://authorize.net "‌")

If you had a manual status in mongo, you could also run a job that checks each day to see if any manual/apple or google customer descriptions changed.

We also have to think about email notifications.

You should probably store **Customer Profile ID in the mongo collect incase we need to query a specific customer from code.**

Maybe it should be in the JWT token?  If someone clicks change subscription or change credit card we need it.

So when we first launch this we will keep using Restrict Content pro as well.  If someone is using RCP you they can see all the same pages as now but all new subscriptions will come in via this new authnet credit card process.  Once a person is on authnet we will always redirect them to these new authnet pages you are building (in the main webapp).

‌

I started a project in github with the authnet api methods we need but I was just testing it.  If you want to add this to our main api or create a new typescript billing api you can.  My code is pretty simple but will help understand.  One main api method /subscribe

It seems possible to export everyone from stripe to [auth.net](http://auth.net "‌") and possibly paypal too so we will try to get rid of RCP as soon as we can.

So this API should send updates to your main subscription API that saves date in mongo just like RCP does not is my thinking :)

DESC: 1. make sure all the dokku names match in prod and uat, for example web should be called app would ideal to match the domain, for both environments
2. remove all the \*.stage and \*.apihost stuff.


   Even the api’s from production should all change to *.prod for consistency and we highlighted the exceptions below.

CARD: Add Mixpanel
DESC: Let me know if we are tracking any mix panel events now.  We should add all the popular actions in both web and coach jack as well as identifying user.   I have mix panel in google tagmanager now but we should just remove tag manager and install it directly. We should check if there are any other libraries we should remove that we are not using.

‌

Track like this.

`mixpanel.track('Sign Up', { 'Signup Type': 'Referral'})`

Download workout
Connect to Garmin, strava, trainingpeaks, intervals
Send workout
Save CJ plan
Copy Community plan to my plans
create a workout
add a workout to library
search

Any other popular things?

mixpanel.identify(email);

CARD: Standardize environment variables and remove them from .env files.
DESC: TD will have 2 independent environments: UAT and PROD. Local development should use local development machine.

![image.png](https://trello.com/1/cards/66733df7e439873e8ade4d42/attachments/667346aaecb496a87afa60a4/download/image.png)

‌

- All variables should be defined in .env file. Sensitive variable should have no value
- For local development, an .env.local file should be used with values used during development. This file should be added in the gitignore, so it’s never commited.
- The environment variables for PROD and UAT environments would be defined as described in this article on the prod and uat dokku server[https://dokku.com/docs/configuration/environment-variables/](https://dokku.com/docs/configuration/environment-variables/ "smartCard-inline")
- as a general rule, instead of having 3 variables like this:
  TELEGRAM\_BOT\_TOKEN_DEV=
  TELEGRAM\_BOT\_TOKEN_STAGE=
  TELEGRAM\_BOT\_TOKEN_PROD=

‌

we should have one variable, with different values depending on the environment we are building:

TELEGRAM\_BOT\_TOKEN

DESC: Let’s try and isolate these environments more and create a cookie specific to UAT and prod.

‌

We could just write a specific subdomain cookie, for [app.uat.trainerday.com](http://app.uat.trainerday.com "‌") but I don’t know if that will cause CJ issues.

You could possibly write multiple cookies, or think about about the best for isolation.

CARD: Routes #2 - Add Strava History to the TODAY
DESC: Using same logic we have but incorporating strava is most important.  But secondly see below.  If you want only do strava now let’s move those other suggestions to another card.


Also if you want to do a few more small things.  We could improve the logic a little try to get better variety.  And for example if a user just did 2 days in a row the recommend workout should be a recovery ride (zone 1 or easy zone 2 < intensity .72 for example.  If yesterday was a hard workout today could be easier like a higher zon2 or tempo.

1. Switch totally to mongodb serverless
2. Switch strava collection to cheaper digital ocean server or mongo serverless

We want to do incremental move if we do option #1.  So we can deploy with zero downtime.  With #2 I think it would be easy since it is a queue. Just turn off queue processing for incoming workouts and switch and turn it back on.
