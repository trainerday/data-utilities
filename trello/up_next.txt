CARD: VO2Max - Estimate
DESC: This is a complicated.  I want to create an automatic VO2max calculation and it has a lot of calculations.

Here is a document representing all the rules just so I don’t forgot.  We will need to get gemni to write all the functions :)

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZUb17xGB3JwRDwSr-FQoqcS08_mnTe2zCkkTCfOHi4k/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZUb17xGB3JwRDwSr-FQoqcS08_mnTe2zCkkTCfOHi4k/edit?usp=sharing "smartCard-inline")

I will add example messages below.

WARNING: Show below if last 2 weeks have been low intensity focus and previously had more high intensity and the VO2max is dropping.

You may notice a slight dip in your estimate as you focus on base training. This is expected and healthy! You're trading a little top-end sharpness for a much stronger endurance engine, which is the key to reaching higher peaks later. Keep up the great work!
