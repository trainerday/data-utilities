CARD: Set all duplicate workouts to private (exact same power segments)
DESC: Maybe we should not allow creating exact duplicates, meaning if someone saves an exact duplicate (power segments only) to private automatically when they save.  Your workout has been saved as private because their is exactly the same workout here “https://…..”

If one has different text comments then I think it should still be considered a duplicate but not so sure about that.

We should also make all workouts with HR sections private?  Just thinking out loud here we can discuss.
