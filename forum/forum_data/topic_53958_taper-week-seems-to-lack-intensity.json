However, I have always thought (based on reading reputable literature) that you want to maintain intensity, and decrease volume in a taper week/phase.

Coach Robert likes 3-month periodization cycles.  Coach Jack allows 6 month plans mostly but we for many people early is a good approach.  It would be nice for us to dig deeper into this and help people choose a good periodization strategy.  I saw one guy on the TR forums say he is fire fighter and 7 day weeks don\u2019t work for him for example.<br>\nThere is so many different variables.</p>",

Hopefully that should be in the next 2-weeks.
