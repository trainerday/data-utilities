This answers most of your questions.  Starting the plan, generally CJ plans feel easy but they are very progressive so by the end they won\u2019t be.  Maybe not deathly hard but not super easy.  Most platforms start hard and go to a little harder or crazy hard.  But if you start and it is on your calendar you can directly click edit plan at the top and it will re-open your plan and let you turn up starting intensity or ride feel, or even change plans to make it harder.  Let me know if I missed anything.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Jeff, so I realized it\u2019s really hard for me to recommend an optimum plan for you.  Over all it seems like you are unlikely to add much to your FTP at this point after doing so much FTP work.  You could add some anaerobic work capacity which can make a ramp test look better but not actually do much for your true 40-60 minute power.  It\u2019s more likely you will add more to your FTP after another season or period of base+build+peak.  You are at risk over over training for this season, depending on many factors so you have to monitor things very closely.  Setting up a good PMC chart and HRV monitoring can help but make sure you are getting lots of high quality foods, sleep and days and weeks off.</p>\n<p>That said, if your body can handle it doing one of our peak blocks like the one with dynamic force, could help your top end performance and you will feel much stronger.  You might want to start at level 5 or something.  Again when an athlete is training hard like you are then it requires more of a great coach evaluation to help you proceed.  If you were doing more of our traditional recommendation you would be much farther from the edge.  So you have the potential now for a great season or a season of feeling a bit burned out.  You need to really be on top of self evaluation to know where you are at as most of us are not good at this.  We feel really great until all of a sudden we don\u2019t.  I am not saying you did anything wrong.  I am just saying it\u2019s harder to evaluate and give you the perfect recommendation as you are closer to the edge.</p>\n<p>If you need any clearer explanation of any of this let me know.  You can see with TrainerRoad lots of people end up burned out on their typical plans but what I believe is the minority say, oh my I had the best season ever. Tons of TR cyclist\u2019s stop following the main recommendations and learn to do their own thing or create a hybrid plan that works for them.  Again, if you make the right choices at this point you can have a really great season.</p>\n<p>If you are starting to get to the point of not being able to sleep as well that is a common indicator of too much stress.</p>\n<p>I hope this helped.  Probably not exactly the answer you were looking for.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Thanks for the intro and the kind words, Alex. And hello Jeff.</p>\n<p>Good to see that you want to be a better cyclist. I think Alex has already gave you a lot of good advice. So maybe this will be kind of a recap. You can use it as a simple plan and steps to folllow.</p>\n<p>First I agree with Alex about your goal. FTP is not really a goal, it is more a means towards a goal. Like kg is never a goal when dropping weight. You don\u2019t want to be less kg. You either want to perform better or be healthier and that is why you measure the kg.</p>\n<p>So, ftp is not the goal. The is to perform better and have more fun riding your bike. So, set yourself a thrilling goal. It can be a Zwift race, badge colletion on Zwift, a Gran Fondo, riding to every city in 100 km\u2019s from your home\u2026whatever.</p>\n<p>Second, check if you are rested. HR and HRV in particular can help with that. If you have been training for years and know how your body feels than it is fine too.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you have no specific goal consistancy is the most important thing you can do for better performance, thus improving ftp.<br>\nSo there are multiple program you can use to improve.</p>\n<p>It is also the mindset. It is a marathon and not a sprint. What you did lately will benefit you not just for now, but for years to come. So keep training and resting and you will reap the benefits in the years to come.</p>\n<p>And do forget to have fun while doing so.</p>",

I have about 3 weeks left in the Sweet Spot training plan. I certainly have made some great progress over the last few weeks as my HR has gone down during the intense workouts but I\u2019m never quite fully rested. Additionally, I started playing badminton on Sundays after the sunday ride (I swapped Saturday and Sunday so Sunday would be the shorter ride) so I may need to reduce the intensity for my weekend workouts.</p>\n<p>I will also be doing track cycling next winter so it sounds like zone 2 will be the way to go indoor to avoid burning out.</p>",
