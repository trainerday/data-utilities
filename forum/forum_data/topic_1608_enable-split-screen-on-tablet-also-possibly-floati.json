      "cooked": "<p><strong>Requested by meesterlars</strong> - Could you please enable split (floating) view on ipadOS? It would be great to be able to run your app next to or on top of another app, like netflix, for example.<br>\nWith that goal in mind, how about making the plus/minus buttons larger, making them easier to hit.<br>\n; )<br>\nOne final tweak; the resistance should be possible to change by sliding one\u2019s finger across the bottom bar, between the plus and minus buttons, don\u2019t you think?<br>\nOtherwise, fantastically simple app!<br>\nThanks!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Discussion</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Alex\u2019s reply:</strong><br>\nHello, thanks so much for the compliment. I see about 3-requests here. I will keep this request as the spit view request. I will research that. Can you describe what you would like to see? The full app on one side of the screen? I never use this mode. I use iPad + phone as a split screen for Netflix and our app <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=9\" title=\":slightly_smiling_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slightly_smiling_face:\"> I know TrainerRoad for example has on desktop some super small minimized mode. Just trying to fully understand what you are asking for.</p>\n<p>Regarding the buttons being bigger, I will create a second request for me. I am always using my thumb on my phone and hit the tab key instead of + and it drives me crazy\u2026 so I am well aware of this one.</p>\n<p>Regarding slider can you describe what you are tryinig to accomplish? A faster way to make big changes vs small changes? One other user suggested long tap for big change and short tap for small change in resistance. Also are you meaning resistance or ERG mode?</p>\n<p><strong>Meesterlars\u2019 reply:</strong><br>\nHey, Alex!</p>\n<p>Thanks for the response. : )</p>\n<p>So, what I would like is to essentially have the iPhone view of your app floating over another app when running on iPad. Kind of the inverse of what I\u2019ve taken a screenshot of here:<br>\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/Us0FT5u\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://imgur.com/a/Us0FT5u</a></p>\n<p>Does that make sense? This would allow TR to run in parallel with any other app. Spotify, Netflix, Safari, whatever.</p>\n<p>As for the slider idea; yup, in resistance mode I\u2019d like to be able to make quick changes and thought a slider would achieve this best. Not critical, just a nice to have. ; )</p>\n<p><strong>Metdechcd\u2019s reply:</strong><br>\nI\u2019m not a fan of a slider button because it is very hard to adjust with sweaty hands and heavy breathing\u2026 I prefer the short-long touch approach or just as it is right now \u2013 a few consecutive taps do the job perfectly. I have my phone screen on a Touchscreen laptop: Nice BIG buttons ;-), and a TV screen as secondary screen connected through HDMI for all media purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Meesterlars\u2019 reply:</strong><br>\nOK, but that grey bar at the bottom isn\u2019t doing anything, right? Sweaty hands or not, let\u2019s put it to use! <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=9\" title=\":grinning:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":grinning:\"></p>\n<p><strong>Alex\u2019s reply:</strong><br>\nThis is a risky slide, a big increase in resistance on wahoo does crazy stuff for example. Too easy to accidentally slide would be my guess but we can focus on the problem rather than the solution. The problem is a better way to make large vs small adjustments. 4 buttons instead of 2 for example, or long click vs short\u2026 We first need to figure out how to make it so it is easier to click the buttons we have. It\u2019s way too easy to click the tabs now when trying to click the resistance change. Really if you look Zwift or TR you don\u2019t even have a fast, easy way to make changes so we are already more flexible. And in settings you change change it from 1% increase to 10% increase so one click means what you want it to.</p>",

Are you suggesting if we can\u2019t do this soon (which we can\u2019t) we should prevent split screen?</p>\n<p>Here is something I have considered, is Xert does some web page you can view your data while riding the app.  If we allowed that and maybe we make the web page on lower part of the screen would that work for you?  I not sure what is technically possible regarding locking a window at the bottom of the screen, but even small browser that you manually put there?  Or maybe we allow you to open netflix or other windows in the top and put our iframe at the bottom\u2026 Just exploring ideas.</p>",

IT Only Requires You to Wear A Heart Rate Monitor That Tracks HRV (Polar H10 Recommended). This Way, You Will Be Abe to</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Determine your aerobic and anaerobic thresholds. For Example, Your Aerobic Threshold Sets The Upper Bound of Your Endurance Training Zone. It is Important This Bound Is Set. Correctly, this Properly Polarize Your Training, and Actually Take Your Easy Activities Easy For Constructive Training Progression.<br>\nAvoid Pitfalls of Common Test Protocols. If you do not have access to a Physiology Lab, You Can Currently Assess Your Aerobic Threshold as the Pace / Power Where You Can Comfortably Hold A Conversation. Since This Method is obviously Not Very Accurate, DFA Alpha 1 Presents an Accurate But Affordable and Non-Invasive Alternative. For The Anaerobic Threshold, Time Trial Fitness Tests Are Hard to Pace and Lead to Significant Fatigue. On The Other Hand, Ramp Tests Which Take A Percentage Of Your Max Power / Pace As Your Anaerobic Threshold Depend on the Ramp Speed \u200b\u200b[\u2026]</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://aiegundance.com/blog/dfa-alpha-1-app-to-track-your-heart-rate-variability-thresholds\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://aiegundance.com/blog/dfa-alpha-1-app-to-track-your-heart-rate-variability-thresholds</a></p>\n<p>Currently, the best source of high-quality HR data is Polar H10 / H9 connected BT. As I mentioned, the EDGE 1030 DFA Alpha 1 widget estimate as well as FATMAXXER provided that it will be connected by BT. Ant + does not give such a quality data on which the author of the <a href=\"http://MUSCLEOXYGENTRAINING.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MUSCLEOXYGENTRAINING.com</a> blog and what I confirmed by registering data and then analyzing in Kubios.</p>\n<p>Estimation of zones (mainly aerobic threshold area) in real time is very useful for polarized training. The HR drift does not mean significance, because the estimation is carried out from HRV data. The fatigue of the body, etc. is also taken into account. A very interesting and cheap alternative to laboratory measurements.</p>\n<p>Hence my request (in another thread) about the possibility of checking training on a trainer based on heart rate. At the beginning of a simple, but you could think about advanced training polarized with heart rate and power control, even estimating the real-time DFA Alpha 1 - FATMAXXER code is available <a href=\"https://github.com/ianpeake/fatmaxxer\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/ianpeake/fatmaxxer</a> (Apache 2.0 license).</p>",

Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t know at that time that BLE connection was way better than ANT+ for this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are 2 examples of artefacts from my endurance session yesterday evening:<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/4e2629434b71fba4311d57c93341d5e2f2bec3fa.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/4e2629434b71fba4311d57c93341d5e2f2bec3fa\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4e2629434b71fba4311d57c93341d5e2f2bec3fa_2_515x375.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"b9l0acdoP1HxUiZ3OhVPAmcRzPY\" width=\"515\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4e2629434b71fba4311d57c93341d5e2f2bec3fa_2_515x375.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4e2629434b71fba4311d57c93341d5e2f2bec3fa_2_772x562.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4e2629434b71fba4311d57c93341d5e2f2bec3fa_2_1030x750.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4e2629434b71fba4311d57c93341d5e2f2bec3fa_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1069\u00d7777 75.2 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>I think they are harmless APC\u2019s but will check with a cardiologist. Sure thing is that one such artefact throws off the a1 value for all windows where it is present. That\u2019s why Fatmaxxer filters them out.</p>\n<p>Fatmaxxer is open source and Java. David has integration of it on the intervals todo list. Post analysis in that case.</p>",
