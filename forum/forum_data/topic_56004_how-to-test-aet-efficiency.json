If Power/HR increases it means that AeT efficiency/capacity is improving.</p>\n<p>In my case I\u2019ve already made a laboratory test in a training center (with the mask while riding) and my thresholds are:<br>\nVT1: 146bpm - load 155W - O2 23,2 ml/min/kg - RER 0,84<br>\nVT2: 171bpm - load 260W - O2 40,3 ml/min/kg - RER 0,99<br>\nVT3: 181bpm - load 305W - O2 48,1 ml/min/kg - RER 1,05</p>\n<p>My CFmax was 184bpm.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve created a workout, where after some warmup I ride for 2x30 min at 140bpm (this way I can also calculate HR decoupling (drift?) of the fist half/second half: <a href=\"https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/aerobic-endurance-and-decoupling/\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Are You Fit?

It seems very high to me, with a quite big effort (135 seems reasonable to me). I\u2019ve read somewhere that the test should be made at 10-15 bpm under VT1. In other places they recommend to stay at VT1.<br>\nDoing the test the other way around by fixing the watt (eg 160W) seems not very comparable over time when my FTP will (hopefully) increase. I\u2019ve read that HR zones are quite fixed, while Power zones not.</p>\n<p>What is your recommendation/opinion?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m interested at comparing AvgPower/AvgHR over time.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Nice question.  I don\u2019t know much about lab testing for AeT or how those O2 values exactly relate.   I do know VT1 should be the same as AeT but to me 146bpm seems very high with a max HR around 184.  People are different.  I do think the accepted belief is below AeT should feel very easy and sustainable for many hours with no problem for any trained cyclist\u2026</p>\n<p>I could ask Andrea about the specifics of these numbers as he has been mask testing cyclists for 30 years\u2026  but I from my perspective that is not necessary.</p>\n<p>If you read Maffetone, he has been focused on AeT for a very long time and his area of expertise.  More so than Joe, although I respect Joe and the cycling training bible a lot.    Anyway. Maffetone\u2019s aerobic test is much simpler to execute.</p>\n<p>Converting his from running to cycling I would say.  Use standardized warmup protocol that slowly brings your HR up over 12-15 minutes to your target.  Then hold your HR in a tight range using consistent breathing patterns and minimize pre-ride eating as it affects your HR a lot.   Then at 20 minutes compare your power in 5 minute increments. So 20-25,25-30, 30-35, 35-40\u2026 And just do that once a week for example and watch the pattern to compare previous weeks and your power should go up for all of them but some times you will only see increments of one of those.</p>\n<p>Maffetone believes their is almost no risk by going to low of target, but going to high can stall progress.  Many of his followers have experienced the same, myself included.  So if it was me I would likely start around 130bpm\u2026 or a value that your breadth does not really change from doing nothing.  Maybe a slight change, but more like walking\u2026 Conversation is just like going on a walk.  If you do this test weekly in 2-3 weeks you should see improvement if your training is truly causing aerobic improvements.</p>\n<p>I did this process but did the opposite, going with my wife that I started running at 135bpm and after 100 days in a row I had an occasional good day that I could go the same slow pace at 95bpm\u2026</p>\n<p>I think most of the cycling community regarding setting \u201cZone 2\u201d talk about an HR target that is too high.</p>\n<p>For me my max HR was the same as yours and I did lots of tests including Moxy, like muscle oxygen, and I could see my LT1 deflection point was clearly at my Maffetone value which was about 130bpm at that time.  These days I shoot for below 125.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>So one problem with your warmup protocol is you move yourself out of predominately fat burning to carb burning with the higher intensities.   This defeats some of that clarity in aerobic efficiency\u2026 but mostly Maffetone does this as a training focus of keeping you fat burning which also ideally includes fasted training.</p>\n<p>This HR/power ratio is so easily affected by pre-ride activities. HR, especially below AeT is very sensitive (how you breath can change it by 5-10bpm, just taking hands off the bars\u2026)\u2026 so to see clear results requires very consistent processes and gentle handling of this testing process.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Ehi Alex, thank you for your extended elaboration! I appreciate a lot.</p>\n<p>As said, I also think that 146 is very high, but this is what came out of the test. In theory it\u2019s the level where the lactate increase of 1ml from the steady level of 1 to 2. I also would do the test at a lower level, for me 135bpm is safe and in any case can\u2019t screw the output too much. 140/145 is very demanding.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll do the test tomorrow morning with my HT (and after that I\u2019ll do my SFR session from CJ plan)<br>\nI\u2019ll read Maffetone too, in the meantime do you have some link to share where I can read something more about it?</p>\n<p>ah, last but not least: you\u2019re right about the warm-up, probably it\u2019s not good like that. It was a my idea to push the HR a bit high and avoid to stay at very low HR for a long.</p>\n<p>How does the HR target work in your app? doesn\u2019t it increase the intensity of the HomeTrainer until the HR is in target? in such case at a certain point I think it will start using carbs to increase it quickly. Could you please elaborate a bit how it works? perhaps I can remove that initial part like this?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/6/61635458074a253e3a88fdd11267e3bffab7b9f5.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"dTx7SkDW6jyP1fBQ8F3FjKxczKl\" width=\"429\" height=\"211\"></p>\n<p>The second 10\u2019 interval is to arrive at HR target. I might also split the 2x30\u2019 main intervals (used to calculate decoupling) in 12x5\u2019, but I\u2019m not sure that the power on those intervals would change a lot, the effort expected is quite low, and the power output I expect is quite steady.</p>\n<p>Tnx again <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",

Maffetone suggest something similar, so yes keeping it for an 1:20 you should be able see this.  Which tells you two things.  Is your target too high and do you have a good base.    Each person is a bit different so I would never assume everyone is exactly the same but it\u2019s just a very good indicator.  So if you wanted to do 2 long intervals after the 5 x 5\u2019 intervals they you could easily just in TrainerDay compare the first long one to the second long one average power and see if there is any decoupling but any of the analysis apps will also show this.</p>\n<p>Maffetone\u2019s big book is good.

Keep that up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I was going to say the exact same thing.<br>\nIf the lab test was done correctly and the measuring devices were calibrated, the test results should be trusted. VT1 sits at an RER of ~0.80 and VT2 at RER=1. And RER (respiratory exchange rate = respiratory quotient = VCO2/VO2) is much more reliable then lactate testing (if the MET cart is functioning correctly).<br>\nBut I am surprised that an LT1 at 146 comes out with a HRmax at 184. Or is this 184, the max during the test and not your true max HR?<br>\nElite riders can have a VT1 that is very close to VT2 (only about 10-15bpm separate), but that is the result of many years of consistent training and a volume that you can only get to if you are a pro. If you are in that case, training at VT1 is clearly hard work. Your cardiovascular system has been trained to achieve that result, but the strain on the muscle system is high at such an output.<br>\nIf you want AeT efficiency, and decoupling calculated for you, use Intervals.icu. It has those parameters by default analysed.<br>\nThe Power/HR quotient is something you can use for the entire aerobic zone as a \u2018sub-max\u2019 test. It allows to follow up progress without doing an all out FTP test. Check decoupling for the duration of the events you\u2019re targeting. If you have significant decoupling after 2 hours, you\u2019re not ready to go ride a Grand Fondo of 5-6 hours. Check both efficiency and decoupling at different intensities below VT2.</p>",

Would love to hear your test results but if you have a very optimized aerobic system you may not see a ton of progress.

But what it does it take your previous 30 seconds power level and adjust from there so if you do ERG warmup, you can get your HR to build up faster and then it will just start from the last ERG power\u2026  So in reality you could just click on quick start and click on HR+ and set to 135\u2026 you don\u2019t even need a workout.  It should remember this 135 but right now that when you restart the app it forgets but we will fix that soon.</p>\n<p>But no short intervals it will not more aggressively increase, it is always slow so ERG is the way to get it to move faster.</p>",

I am not sure how much heat is affecting you, because if you are heating up I would also consider this good.</p>\n<p>If do happen to be well ventilated, at a reasonably low temperature, I think either you have room for aerobic improvement or you also could try the same test with 130bpm and see what happens.</p>\n<p>What was your breathing like? How easy did it feel compared to going on a walk?  If you were really following Maffetone\u2019s suggestions then it feels too easy for most people when they start doing efforts like this. Also focus on deep breadths and you will see your power go up\u2026 but most important from test to test is consistency.  So just from a test perspective to compare to the future this seems good.</p>",
