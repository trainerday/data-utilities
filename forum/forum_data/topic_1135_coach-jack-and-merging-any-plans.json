      "cooked": "<p>I am thinking outloud here of something I think would be cool, currious if anyone else sees this as super cool.</p>\n<p>So I as well as others here feel, Coach Jack is super cool and powerful (seeing how much use it gets each day it feels \u201cpopular\u201d).  What I see is lots of options now but also lots of ways you might want to create totally customize plans.  As an example you could crate a few different coach Jack plans or even create custom plans using existing workouts or plans and merge them together into a single plan.</p>\n<p>Just select the weeks you want from one plan and insert the into an existing plan.  This is not Coach Jack specific but seems like this could make Jack plans 100% customizable, with months like December being totally different.</p>\n<p>Below is how simple it would be to do this.<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/90278096b0fb51965d4cb8e7b156bf50732dd351.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/90278096b0fb51965d4cb8e7b156bf50732dd351\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/90278096b0fb51965d4cb8e7b156bf50732dd351_2_538x500.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"kzfo7qUPCDSRQoB6MpV5o4MWcox\" width=\"538\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/90278096b0fb51965d4cb8e7b156bf50732dd351_2_538x500.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/90278096b0fb51965d4cb8e7b156bf50732dd351.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/90278096b0fb51965d4cb8e7b156bf50732dd351.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/90278096b0fb51965d4cb8e7b156bf50732dd351_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">598\u00d7555 54.5 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",

That is, someone can create independent plans and unite them, but would it be ideal for training?</p>\n<p>Suppose someone created a base plan and then joined it with a peak plan. The final plan wouldn\u2019t make much sense.</p>\n<p>As functionality it is perfect, but you should have some knowledge when putting together the plan so that it makes sense.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, as Coach jack is at this moment, you don\u2019t have to have much knowledge about the training phases, TSS, etc. Just create the plan and train because you are confident that it makes sense.</p>\n<p>I clarify that it is always better to have some knowledge when training.</p>",
