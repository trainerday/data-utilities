      "cooked": "<p>TSS does go up in CJ plans but usually it\u2019s best if you let time build as the plan goes up which also makes TSS go up.  Chasing TSS is a slippery slope and not usually the best idea but generally your stress should be going up through the plan.  Secondly is the main work intervals are also increasing and next to total volume/weekly hours this is the most important component.  FTP test have been the standard for measuring progress but you can also do an aerobic test that is not so hard like 20 minutes of zone 2 (specific watts) and watch your HR and over months your HR should be going down\u2026  I would say generally you just need to find \u201cyour way.\u201d Which is what works best for you and how you like to train.  Could be RPE like you say.  How hard does a specific workout feel but that can be very temporary feeling good or bad\u2026</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>I think the obvious answer here is that you need to \u201ctest\u201d yourself somehow. I use several different testing methods depending on what my training focus is, but I mostly use either a ramp test or 20 minute test. Like Alex said though, there are many other options. Another one I\u2019ve used in the past is very similar to the aerobic test he mentions, where I do 85% of my FTP for 40 minutes and afterwards I\u2019ll inspect my HR drift and RPE.</p>\n<p>So if you want to start doing this, you need to do an initial test to have a baseline. Then after some period of training, do the test again and see if you have any performance differences. For example If I\u2019m doing a threshold block I\u2019ll usually do a 20 minute test around the start of the block, and then at the end I\u2019ll retest to see if I\u2019ve improved my threshold or time to exhaustion. Now the obvious drawback to these tests is that external factors could affect the test results. Things like how fresh you are feeling, the temperature of the environment you do the tests in, mental focus that day, nutrition before the test, and countless others. So do your best to try and replicate the scenario you took your baseline test in.</p>\n<p>Now after saying all of the above, I think it is also important to not overthink things. If you are feeling better (lower RPE) at a certain power, or if your HR is more stable or lower, or you are doing more distance/speed, trust that you are making improvements. Like Alex said though these things can vary greatly by the day. So just make sure to track trends over days/weeks rather than just looking at one day where you felt great or really bad.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>",

Personally, I hate testing. It is boring, it takes time (with rest days and all), and it is limited, meaning most tests only measure a small part of your performance.</p>\n<p>That is why the pros test in the field. They often test the scenarios they will race.</p>\n<p>I am very happy with the new FTP test in Zwift. A track you can ride where they measure FTP.</p>\n<p>But normally, I use kom\u2019s to test myself. They are more of a challenge, and that brings out the best in me.  I like to use the Three little sisters route. It has three kom\u2019s that test three different power zones over a longer track. That makes the whole test more realistic than one 20-minute effort.</p>\n<p>I use intervals.ICU, too, but that too has its limitations. However, I think it is complete, and the benefits of using these programs come over time. I have been using it for four years, and for my last race, I analyzed my best season and replicated that program with great results.</p>\n<p>For my next race, I will use the same program with some extras. After that race, I will look at the data on intervals. I will look for any signs that I have improved (like lower HR and/ or higher speed) and then look at the data intervals.ICU is giving me.</p>\n<p>That way I can easily translate how intervals.ICU portrays my progress.</p>\n<p>Creating progressive overload is a fine line between doing a little extra where you can. Most cyclists forget to rest. That is why I agree with Alex that chasing TSS is not the best way.</p>\n<p>A good example is happening right now. Over the last few weeks, my mother-in-law has been in the hospital. This means my wife and I have to visit her, make appointments with doctors, and bring her clothes and stuff. Besides these extra tasks, her health is uncertain, which also causes mental stress.</p>\n<p>My schedule is very hectic and full of stress. That means my body can handle less training load. If I keep pumping my usual or planned progressive overload, it could now easily take me over the edge and burn me out or make me sick. The smart thing to do is listen to my body and be flexible in my training schedule.</p>\n<p>Have fun, Coach Robert</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Thank you, Dave.</p>\n<p>Doing a route like Three Little Sisters and go all-in also learns you a lot about your recovery. It shows you what your power is in those different zones, but maybe more important what you an after you have layed down your power on the first two. And if you really want to go for it, what you have left in the last part, after you have allready drained yourself on thse kom\u2019s.</p>\n<p>That is valuable information you don\u2019t get from training and tests.</p>\n<p>There is a difference in doing you intervals every week, testing you FTP frequently and riding Liege-Bastogne-Liege in the rain and wind, with the redoute at the end.</p>\n<p>In other words, you might be able to push those 3 minute zone 5 intervals in a short training, but can you still do the same after 220km\u2019s !?</p>\n<p>This is what we call: fatique resistance.</p>\n<p>By the way, you dont always have to smash it, Dave. You are already doing great being on the bike and riding consistently.</p>\n<p>Have fun, Coach Robert</p>",
