      "cooked": "<p>This may be a niche request, but it might be nice to be able to map an activity to a specific workout on a plan.  If I\u2019m on a plan and I do one of the workouts, but maybe I had to cut it short due to time or fatigue (let\u2019s say time), that would impact the rest of that week\u2019s total target stress score.  If we could map the actual activity to the planned workout, we could see the deficit (or excess) that we\u2019d need to make up for during the rest of the week and adjust remaining workouts as needed.</p>\n<p>Right now I\u2019m tracking this in a spreadsheet that has the goal and actual TSS for each week.  When I fail to complete a workout (due to time, remember), using this spreadsheet I can then modify the rest of the workouts for that week to help keep me on target.  It might be as simple as adding a field for the weekly goal TSS in the plan definition.  Then in the week\u2019s line that shows total time and stress you can add something like remaining stress differential.  That way when you modify a future workout it will offset any weekly total stress from accomplished activities.</p>",
