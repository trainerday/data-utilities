      "cooked": "<p>Hi, I use the TrainerDay auto-upload for Itervals.icu. However, as I\u2019ve investigated this further, I\u2019ve now noted it\u2019s been happening off and on for a while, and includes workouts without slope. My current sense of this is that it\u2019s probably due to the relay of data between my apps, and the HealthFit app is either the common denominator or the final relay of bad data. It uploads the same TrainerDay file to Intervals.icu (so it has two files, one from Strava and one from HealthFit, and this has worked fine until recently). I am not entirely sure where HealthFit is getting its bad data, but I use it to sync Apple Watch workouts with Strava, Intervals.icu, TrainingPeaks. It\u2019s possible that HealthFit has started to not recognise the info from the workout, and then upload to Intervals, or another app is doing that and syncing to HealthFit before it uploads (RidewithGPS for example does not recognise any power/watts in any TrainerDay ride, at least on my set up).  So I am in the middle of a trial and error process where I\u2019m mapping the apps and stopping certain syncs to see if I can remedy this. I think I have a preliminary solution in simply stopping auto uploads from HealthFit, but I need to figure out why an app is not recognising TrainerDay power data, etc.</p>",
