Easy way to do this for me is to look at the HR curve in my Intervals.icu account and take note of my highest sustained HR for 20min in the past 42 days.</p>\n<p>So here goes my stab at figuring out threshold HR.</p>\n<p>Current age: 49<br>\nHighest sustained HR for 20 min in the past 6 weeks: 170</p>\n<p>Using the 5% above max 20min hr, that would put my threshold HR at 179 which is right at my highest documented hr in recent training.</p>\n<p>If I take 80% of my max (179) (the \u201cother\u201d way to get a threshold HR), that puts me at 143bpm - which seems low as that\u2019s about where I sit for some Z2 rides.</p>\n<p>Another point of reference\u2026</p>\n<p>At a recent 67 mile gravel race (3100\u2019 elevation gain) where I ended up 6th overall, I averaged 158bpm for 3hr 41m with a max recorded HR of 176.  Efforts were a mix of \u201cOMG I don\u2019t think I can hang on\u201d to sitting up with the front group that didn\u2019t want to do any work <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> In the end, 3 of us pulled off the front group to come in P4/5/6 together.  Was my best-ever finish in a proper gravel race.  Taught me a lot about working smarter, not harder - was able to do this with a modest 3.5 w/kg ftp.</p>\n<p>So, back to the initial question - how the heck do I come up with a threshold HR? <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Wow, 6th, cool.  I am dreaming of my first gravel race, likely next year. But my first will be pretty flat\u2026</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you look at the 5% it would be 5% less not 5% more\u2026 you calculated backwards there. That puts you at 161 which compared to your 158 for 4 hours sounds pretty close.  I like Daves answer on Joe Friels test as well.</p>\n<p>Most people won\u2019t hit a max HR in a long event.  My bet is your max HR is closer to 180-182 if you did a max HR (3 all out sprints after a good warmup) test but that is just a total guess.  So because you can sustain such a high percent for 4 hours   I would say you are very aerobically fit or your HR max is higher than you think and you are still aerobically fit <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>So I would use 161, but it\u2019s possible its a bit higher than that.  158 4 hours 161 for 60 minutes is very tight but since you have a very high threshold the numbers do get much tighter.  If your max HR was a bit higher than you think I might think your threshold could be between 163-165\u2026</p>",

I guess if I were to be doing threshold intervals like the 2x12 and I didn\u2019t reach LTHR then maybe my FTP has gone up or I\u2019ve over-trained and if I went over LTHR then maybe my FTP has gone down or the air flow is too low, it\u2019s too hot, I have off the bike stress, etc\u2026</p>\n<p>The reason I did the 30-minute is because it is a lesser evil FTP test.  I find the 20-minute test is very difficult when you include the 5 minute blow out period before it and the ramp test for me is not accurate, there is way too much anaerobic component.  The 30-minute result seems to be something I can actually use for setting training intervals.</p>\n<p>Friel has another test, a FTP verification test, that uses LTHR along with 4 minute work/1 minute recovery steps to confirm FTP.  This could be used instead of the 30 minute test because it hurts less and is still reasonably accurate.  The idea is that FTP will still occur at LTHR when it goes up and down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.trainingbible.com/joesblog/2008/08/ftp-confirmation-test.html\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.trainingbible.com/joesblog/2008/08/ftp-confirmation-test.html</a></p>\n<p>Dave</p>",

Coach Jack starts easy and eases you into hard stuff so most people will adapt to it at the speed it progresses.  If you are following more of the TrainerRoad style of sustained sweet spot or what I consider worse starting with 4x10 or 2X20 threshold workouts or something accuracy becomes much more important (that it\u2019s not too high) to reduce the suffering or increase the chance of survival.</p>\n<p>So for me last year my ramp tests were like 230 watts and I am sure my FTP was closer to 200watts. I also have a strong anaerobic component.  But I guess since I know this I just adjust it down to 200 and it is close enough from a training perspective (Coach Jack suggested style).</p>\n<p>So the great advantage of a ramp test is that it tends to be more consistent as many people blow 20 minute tests with poor pacing.  Not to mention the suffering so most will rarely do it.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t understand though.  Why is a 30 minute easier than a 20 minute?  My mind is kind of shot so I don\u2019t fully understand what Joe is saying there but I was thinking a longer ramp FTP test would remove more of the anaerobic component.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Ah, these are interesting topics. Let\u2019s start with why, in my opinion, you can never just use power, and heart rate is still important.</p>\n<p>There is a difference in your performance output and its impact on your body.<br>\nPower measures the output and heart rate measures the effect of that output on the body.<br>\nSince many more external factors (such as temperature, time of day, etc.) and interval factors (such as hydration, core temperature, length of the training, etc.) influence heart rate, it is not ideal for measuring intensity.<br>\nIt is, however, essential to see how the body is coping with all the stress while performing.</p>\n<p>So, in general, I recommend using power to guide the intensity of your training and heart rate to check on your progress.</p>\n<p>We always expect to deliver the same FTP every training session, but let me tell you firsthand that after three days of hard training, even my recovery workout yesterday was a pain.</p>\n<p>That being said, how do you set your training zones for heart rate? The only right way to do this is to measure lactate for both aerobic and anaerobic thresholds.</p>\n<p>But since this is a costly test, you can also use max heart rate to calculate this. Or, as you already discussed, use a 20\u2014or 30-minute field test. The downside of a 20\u2014or 30-minute field test is that external factors play a big role again\u2014much more than with a max heart rate test.</p>\n<p>Never perform a max heart rate test without knowing that you are healthy. Although this test is short, the impact on the heart is high.<br>\nIf you are already in your forties and up, I would seek out a doctor and ask his/ her advice if this is healthy.</p>\n<p>The thing with these test are the outcome is only temporary. After four weeks of dedicated training the values can go up and after two weeks of rest the have gone down.</p>\n<p>If you are consistent with your schedule over time, you will see that these thresholds move within a range.</p>\n<p>The thresholds are also connected. Do a lot of aerobic work, and not only will your aerobic threshold go up, but your anaerobic threshold will go down, too, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>The more data you gather, the better you will understand your body. For instance, it can be beneficial to do a test indoors and one outdoors, from the perspective of temperature.<br>\nYou will see that there is a difference.</p>\n<p>In the end, there are different tests that measure the same outcome. They all have pros and cons. Do the test, use the outcome in a training session, and decide if that result is valid for your training.</p>\n<p>Finally, stick with one test that works best for you. And occasionally, let yourself be tested by a pro.</p>\n<p>Have lots of fun</p>",

But sure, everyone doing intense exercise should check with a doctor.</p>\n<p>FYI - Here is what GPT says</p>\n<p>GPT: For generally healthy individuals, especially those under 35 and without known heart disease, the risk of a cardiac event during intense exercise (including MHR testing) is extremely low. The incidence rate is estimated to be around <strong>1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 hours of exercise</strong>.</p>\n<p>GPT: The risk increases with age, particularly for those over 35, due to the higher prevalence of underlying cardiovascular disease. The risk during vigorous exercise for this group is estimated to be about <strong>1 in 15,000 to 1 in 50,000 hours of exercise</strong>.</p>\n<p>Alex: So intense exercise is more risking for a cardiac event than driving a car is for a serious accident this would not stop me.</p>\n<p>So play it safe and stick to zone 2 <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",
