After their nasty moves in Nov and Dec last year I have decided I don\u2019t want to pay them any more, and possibly don\u2019t need them even as a free syncing service if they are going to use my data but deny that possibility to 3rd parties.</p>\n<p>Long story short, my workout history lives in Intervals and TR and now in TD too, but ended for Strava in November.</p>\n<p>So! I see Coach Jack can look at Strava history, but what am I missing now that Strava is essentially empty? can I get around that by tweaking settings myself?</p>\n<p>long post sorry!</p>",

This is what we feel is the smartest / safest choice.  Where other platforms prefer to throw people under the bus and just suck it up\u2026   Some survive, some thrive and some don\u2019t\u2026</p>\n<p>Anyway, you are fine just using the non-strava route, it\u2019s mostly there to save you a bit of time.  Which most people don\u2019t take the default recommendations anyway and that is all it all it is doing.</p>",

I was just thinking about writing an article about this.</p>\n<p>My clients often ask me if the training is not too light, wondering if this will deliver them progress. I always respond that they need to have a little patience. A couple of weeks later they feel the change. They feel stronger and have more energy.</p>\n<p>Rest and workouts that don\u2019t exhaust you to the very last bit of energy are really the keys to a good program. You can always raise the load, but once you are past too much, it will be very hard to recover. Think months to a year.</p>\n<p>But I get it. It is just one of the pitfalls of an enthusiastic cyclist</p>\n<p>After my 10-hour race at the end of December, I find it very hard in my mind to accept that right now a 45minute training can be enough. From summer to December, I have been doing a lot of long workouts.</p>\n<p>I need to mentally step back and force myself to build up my training again for my next long race in June, mainly because I want to race harder than ever.</p>\n<p>More is not always better\u2026</p>",
