      "cooked": "<p>After the Elite Tuo disaster, I kept on searching for a trainer solution for my specific needs.  I need a trainer that I can easily swap bikes and the main use will be Zone 2 HR based workouts (the key feature of Trainerday imo <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> ).</p>\n<p>A lot of hours of searching and reading, I decided to go for the Kickr Rollr.  First test : brilliant.</p>\n<p>Installation and setup was a piece of cake, even if my setup is not as simple as it could be if Garmin would allow activity uploads.  Setting up the trainer using the Wahoo app, connecting the power sensor.  Then go into Trainerday : voila\u2026  The extra was I connect it also to a Garmin device, which also worked.  In less than 5 minutes, I had a bike setup, the trainer setup, Trainerday working and a Garmin device capturing the workout.</p>\n<p>What is the real plus of this setup : the ride comfort on rollers is the best I\u2019ve had on any trainer.  OK, I never tried the \u201cmoving\u201d new generation of smart trainers.  Too expensive.  This does make a big difference.  On a \u201cnormal\u201d trainer, doing 60 minutes of riding is about a much as I can handle.  Then I need a break.  Just for comfort reasons.  The feeling on this setup is totally different. The back wheel is moving, which makes all the difference.</p>\n<p>The negative : like it is explained everywhere, keeping power is not a the same level as a \u201cnormal\u201d smart trainer.  Funny I can even share the data:<br>\nThis is on the Rollr:<br>\n<a href=\"https://app.trainerday.com/activities/6650cbea51749bfddab8e117\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Trainer Day - Activity Detail</a><br>\nThis is on a normal smart trainer:<br>\n<a href=\"https://app.trainerday.com/activities/664e3adb51749bfddaaaab15\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Trainer Day - Activity Detail</a></p>\n<p>What is \u201cfunny\u201d about this, is that most likely the power on this Rollr is more reflecting the reality of an outdoor ride.  If feels more natural.  Of course, it does also mean if you would buy the Rollr for ERG HIIT sessions, it\u2019s probably not ideal.</p>",
