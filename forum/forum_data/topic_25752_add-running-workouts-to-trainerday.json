The speed would came from Runn podometer via bluetooth.</p>\n<p>is this possible?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance and thanks for your trainerday strategy.</p>",

It could be like we do swimERG and rowERG now and we do show speed and distance since we did not need the + - functionality since they are not controllable.  We would probably avoid trying to control smart trainers any time in the near future.</p>",

I wish running would all just hurry up and switch to power based, then in theory it would be easy <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">   I know we have pods for power now but still seems to be the minority.  Does your treadmill output power?  I would guess some do.  Or if people were interested we could add a converter.  Slope + Pace + Weight = power, then you could just do power based workouts.  I know swimmers and rowers tend to be more distance interval based.  With our app we realized distance based intervals are almost impossible in our app, or would be a serious amount of work.</p>\n<p>So time and power based running even with virtual power like the dumb trainers with no power meter should be fairly easy to do.  The good thing about running is this estimation of power would be much more accurate than the dumb bike trainers.  So it\u2019s a more viable solution.</p>\n<p>If people let me know that power and time were fine for training I would be much more open to building it.  It\u2019s also very possible we or someone could build an interval creator that would convert speed, slope and distance to power and time and just create an ERG or ZWO file from that but ultimately in our app it would still be time and power based.</p>\n<p>Sorry this request just got me thinking, how could we do this.</p>",
