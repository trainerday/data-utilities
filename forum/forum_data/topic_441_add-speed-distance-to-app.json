It might not be important in the same way as power and heart rate data, but it\u2019s important to me not just as a motivator, but also to help me understand and roughly translate the work I\u2019m doing in a particular gear to what my bike is doing. I use a crank power meter on my road bike with a resistance trainer.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>",

Try to find the Speed/Power curve for your trainer. And send it to Alex so he can build a database for non-smart-trainers.<br>\nAltough, if you have a crank Power meter, I don\u2019t see much use of implementing this in the Trainerday app. Because being the owner of a crank power meter means that you have a Bike computer\u2026 Use that to record all data from your indoor ride and use the Trainerday app to visualize your structured training with Power from your Power Meter. Your bike computer almost certainly uses FIT file format and that format can contain a lot more data compared to TCX used in the TrainerDay app.<br>\nI already made my point in the App Expectations thread <a href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/t/app-expectations/66/16\">https://forums.trainerday.com/t/app-expectations/66/16</a><br>\nI don\u2019t need another app that can do anything like a Swiss knife. I need an app that let\u2019s me control my indoor structured training as best as possible. And TrainerDay is getting pretty close to perfect for my use case.<br>\nBut please feel free to disagree with me\u2026<br>\nI do see the usefullness to record Speed, but would display Virtual Power iso of speed. Speed is pretty meaningless on an indoor trainer because very dependent on the resistance setting.<br>\nAnd if you record your activity on the bike computer, you got it there anyway.</p>",

Ideally it would be optional.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, having customizable data fields/displays is the only way you\u2019ll appeal to and suit the needs of a wide variety of individuals.</p>\n<p>I am already using my Garmin head unit at the same time, and it displays current speed and distance. I sync my TrainerDay workout with Strava, and it provides speed and distance. Neither of these addresses being able to see my current speed and total distance during a workout in TrainerDay.</p>\n<p>This is just my personal opinion and preference, and I can\u2019t speak to what is important to everybody else. But I like having current speed displayed as I translate everything I do on the bike back to being on the road or trail.</p>\n<p>Truly hoping TrainerDay goes the direction of appealing to a wider variety and greater group of users, from casual users to racers. A rigid training app will always only appeal to rigid group of hardcore users. There are plenty of those out there. A flexible app can appeal to the millions of people who do not, and will never, invest hundreds/thousands in gadgets and just want to hop on the bike and ride. Appealing to that wider audience could make the lower price model of TD a success. And with a few simple settings/options for customizing how we want to train, could be clean and effective and still appeal to the most hardcore.</p>\n<p>Again, just my $0.02 <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>I can think of at least four people right now who have basic resistance trainers who I would recommend the app to if they could just hop on with a speed sensor and ride. They would be the type of people to pay $3-5/mo and happily work out a few times per week while watching TV. They will never buy power meters, track training stress, don\u2019t care a whole lot about data, aren\u2019t racing, and won\u2019t spend $20/mo on software. But there are lots of them out there.</p>\n<p>Seeing how fast you\u2019re going when you\u2019re on a bike is one of the most basic metrics in cycling that has been around forever. Speed matters! <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",

I am not disagreeing with you let me provide a little more understand of my side.</p>\n<p>Swappable fields is slightly expensive feature to implement because you need a field designer page.  I also believe this is a minority request at this time but I have heard of others asking so I might be wrong.  Regarding yoru friends, I believe the best solution for dumb trainers is not showing speed and distance but to convert speed and distance to virtual power.  This allows them to train just like if they had a power meter (or similar anyway).  VIrtual power is a request I definitly want to do and a popular request.  If they just want to record and see their speed than using a bike computer or other software is fine.  Our app is more about structured workouts which makes a lot more sense with power.</p>\n<p>When you say speed matters, I could ask which is harder 30km/hr or 10km/hr?  The answer is we don\u2019t know\u2026 We don\u2019t know if you are going up hill or downhill.  Without some indication of gradient speed is hard to quatify.  Outdoors pedalling harder is not necessarily related with going faster but might just be a steeper hill\u2026 <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>I fully understand your point and I am not disagreeing that people without power meters outdoors appreciate and relate to seeing speed and distance indoors. If our app used a fixed arbitrary graidient like 0.5% (like we do with our converter)\u2026</p>\n<p>Today, most of the riders using our app have power meters outdoors and relate to power.  I also agree 100% regarding lots of apps focused on racers.  I am happy to provide value to the fitness rider. And I am passionate about presenting a more health focused approach to performance.   We will just watch the votes and think about the associated cost with developing this and see if it makes sense.</p>\n<p>Thanks agin for your insights.</p>",

It better reflects the intensity. It will probably only take you one or two workouts to match that displayed Power number to an RPE felt on the road. And you can\u2019t do this with Speed only, because you can have the same RPE with different speeds when on different resistance settings\u2026</p>",
