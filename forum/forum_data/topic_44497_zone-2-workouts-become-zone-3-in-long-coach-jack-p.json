There seems to be a problem with Z2 progression near the end of the plan (interestingly, not the very last few weeks but a little before that) - e.g. see below, 120m Fard Endurance workout which contains 88% blocks and three times more time in Tempo zone than Endurance.

But at the same time I know that a lot of people feel that TSS progressions are so critical.   So we knew we wanted to design our main work very specific intervals that were very based on logical difficulty progressions not based on TSS increases.  You can have two different workouts with the same TSS and one can be impossible and the other could be easy.</p>\n<p>So anyway, what I did is built all our secondary work to slowly increase in a logical increase that matches peoples expectations regarding TSS increases.  Secondly and generally as you progress through your plan, more intensity makes sense as people reach the end of their plan the workouts can be much harder and match more real world race or performance goals.  So I ran this idea by Andrea and he thought it was fine/good.  Andrea is not a zone 2 purist.  He has prescribed a lot of zone 2/3 power but let the cyclist define the actual intensity level based on feel/rpe.  He would say go try to spend 2 hours of your ride just climbing today in z2/z3\u2026</p>\n<p>So to answer your question I think the secondary work or endurance work can be very much by feel in our workouts.  We partially manage TSS which gives some safe guard to over training but this stuff is very subjective and their is no proof as to what is perfect regarding fine tuning z2/z3 work for max performance.  It\u2019s mostly about not doing too much intensity to dig yourself into a hole.</p>\n<p>So in your case, I would say do what you like, what resonates with you.  I also would say \u201cZone 2\u201d focus should be merged with periodization for optimum training and more in the context of easy and hard. Take note that as you progress through your season it might start at 100/0 and later turn to 80/20 (Time in zone, Seiler suggests 90/10), but ultimately seasonally you might be 90/10.  Seiler is not suggesting anything related to periodization in his training advice so adding in periodization you have more flexibility to work much harder later in the season\u2026 wow long answer <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>Hope that helps\u2026</p>",

It brings more risk, and most people that need top performance have outside ways of getting this intensity and outdoors nothing is ever perfect and has a stronger element of pushing based on how it feels.  4 minute intervals can turn into 5 if it feels right\u2026</p>",

So that increase in difficulty could come in the method of decreasing the Z2, Z3 and increasing the Z4 length like you wanted.  He really feels 8 minutes of threshold is the maximum that is needed.  So you can alternatively just increase the intensity a bit to like 104% of FTP\u2026  So it could be a mix of either.  In this case you could just press + in our app for example.</p>\n<p>So ultimately I agree with you that we should just add a harder variant of this.</p>\n<p>Secondly the part I had wrong is their is no reason to switch to another block unless you feel you have stopped improving and feel a bit stuck or are time constrained with some specific workouts that are closer related to a specific goal/event.</p>",
