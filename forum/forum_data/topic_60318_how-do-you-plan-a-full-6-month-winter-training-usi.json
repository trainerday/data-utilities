      "cooked": "<p>Hi Peter,</p>\n<p>What a good way to approach your training. I would even take it a step further and create a plan for a year.</p>\n<p>So here is how I do this for my clients. I select 3 major goals with them.  These goals can be anything from riding a Gran Fondo to just getting fitter. Preferably, these goals are spread over 6 months.</p>\n<p>Next, we start with a base period. I always use hiit training all year round. Only in rest weeks is there no interval training.<br>\nI like to use 3 blocks and spend 4 weeks in each block. This makes it easy to follow, since each block will be one month. After 12 weeks you ride a goal (or subgoal), followed by a rest week.<br>\nThen you start the whole cycle again.</p>\n<p>Every cycle starts with what I\u2019d like to call a relative rest week. You are training, doing hiit, but the total volume is lower than week 4. It is a periodisation within your periodisation that prevents you from overtraining, stimulating proper rest and growth.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve added one of the plans I wrote for a client. It is one month in a build phase, but the base and peak look similar, with a few differences specific to that phase.<br>\nYou can see the tss building up and going down in week 5.</p>\n<p>Hitting Vo2max is not a big problem, and neither is the loss of progression. In a rest week you might lose a little fitness, but you gain back form. As long as you train consistently throughout the year, over the years to come, these slight changes are not important, but natural. Most cyclist focus to much on their progression for this month instead of the bigger picture. Building true fitness takes time. Learn to love and it will be your friend forever.</p>\n<p>I would just play around and try to build and follow some blocks now, in order to be prepared for October.</p>\n<p>A last, but important tip is to keep your plan flexible. The first draft of your plan is like a red wire through your season, but it shouldn\u2019t be written in stone. When you are sick, you take a week off. No problem. Adjust the plan if you need to.</p>\n<p>Have fun, Coach Robert<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f767641a6102d8948edccf052b93b32126c63b43.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/f767641a6102d8948edccf052b93b32126c63b43\" title=\"Schermopname (65)\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f767641a6102d8948edccf052b93b32126c63b43_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"Schermopname (65)\" data-base62-sha1=\"ziDrRHT6JvDqlDwk0INc9Uyki55\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f767641a6102d8948edccf052b93b32126c63b43_2_690x388.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f767641a6102d8948edccf052b93b32126c63b43_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f767641a6102d8948edccf052b93b32126c63b43_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"CFD0D9\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">Schermopname (65)</span><span class=\"informations\">1920\u00d71080 302 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>ps: the weekend training seems like tempo, but they are really zone 2.

Which can be exactly the same as one of the standard blocks with a little more control.  It\u2019s very easy.</p>\n<p>The main thing as Robert suggests is around your goals.  If you like a hard indoor winter and feeling strong in the spring for outdoors that could be the driver that everything revolves around.  Frequently around this time of year it\u2019s more about just holding on to the fitness you gained for the next 3-6 months and then repeat the cycle trying to get to a new high\u2026  But it\u2019s about matching the training with you and your preferences and goals.  The main thing is not to just try to push harder and harder for ever, have some ups and downs. That could be rotated blocks like Robert does of about 3 months each, or that could longer full yearly periodization that many racers do.  But 6 month plans are in between those two or something that cyclocross racers follow frequently for example.</p>",
