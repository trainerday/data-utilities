Is it possible to view/run/ride this plan in the app (free) or do I need to upgrade for that?</p>\n<p>Also, a seperate question - I noticed the \u2018intensity\u2019 label on some workouts. My understanding is that this is like a % of FTP (e.g. 0.8 = 80% of # FTP). Is there any further source where I can read up and understand what intensity level would be appropriate to assign for custom workouts?</p>\n<p>Many thanks,<br>\nV.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi Vas, yes you must upgrade to use your plan or your workouts in our app. You can download and use the files for free in GoldenChetah for example.</p>\n<p>Intensity comes from the term IF (intensity factor) in TrainingPeaks.  The ideas of TSS(stress) and CLT relate to intensity. There is a lot to learn there if you want but unless the math of endurance cycling really interests you I would ignore this as you can get fast (faster) by riding more with some varied workouts and good recovery. If you really want more info I can find you links or you can read a book like Training with a power meter by Allen/Coggan.</p>",
