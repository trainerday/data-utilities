      "cooked": "<p>Powermatch is a function to eliminate a discrepancy between Trainer reported Power (often not accurate at all) and the Power read from a real Power Meter. The app reads the power from the power meter and compares to the target that was sent to the trainer. If there is a difference, the app sends an offset target value and tries to match the Power Meter with the intended target.<br>\nI don\u2019t have any experience with the Stages bike but since it has a Power Meter incorporated, I think that same functionality is already implemented in the bike itself. And probably it goes nuts when another app also tries to correct the resistance. Hence the strange behaviour you experience.<br>\nIn the second case with PowerMatch off, I think you will need to use the option of doubling singel sided Power. Bluetooth has limited support for double sided power. Some models send both signals L/R over one channel, others only send L-Power.<br>\nSo bottom line, try PowerMatch=Off and Double single sided power=On.<br>\nIn the end, if the app keeps you on target and you record on your Garmin, it doesn\u2019t really matter what the app reads. It would just maybe be confusing when looking at it.<br>\nMaybe both modes even work ok when you use Double Single Sided Power. Or check if Stages allows to send both L/R power over one channel in BlueTooth. My Favero\u2019s do that - Both channels over ANT+ and the sum of both over Bluetooth.</p>",

Without the SB20 Bike connection, TrainerDay obviously can\u2019t control bike resistance. This connection is more useful for things like single leg tests.</p>\n<p>You can alternatively connect the <strong>SB20 Bike + one Power Meter:</strong></p>\n<p>a. Use <strong>Settings &gt; Add Devices +</strong>: Connect <strong>SB20 Bike</strong> &amp;   <strong>one</strong> individual crank Power Meter<br>\nb.  <strong>Settings &gt; Account &amp; Additional Settings &gt; Double Single Side Power</strong>: <em>On</em></p>\n<p>Power display also works properly. TrainerDay appears to take the single side power meter and ignores the relayed value from the SB20 head unit. Nice but this combination consumes two BT connections with minimal incremental value.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Good advice.  I am still trying to figure out the differences in the individual Bike and Power Meter data streams. The data from only the <strong>SB20 Smart Bike</strong> connection is likely the best in most scenarios.</p>\n<p>The SB20 Bike and Sensors support:</p>\n<p><strong>2 BT Connections to Bike</strong> - Dedicated bi-directional connections.  Once 2 bike connections are established, the bike stops listing itself as a BT endpoint until a connection is freed up.</p>\n<p><strong>1 BT Connection per Power Meter</strong>  1 dedicated uni-directional connection per Power Meter.</p>\n<p>**Unlimited Ant+ Connections for Bike and Power Meter  **</p>\n<p>So far I managed to get 10 different listeners to different Ant+ streams.  The Bike connection use bi-directional <strong>Ant+ FE-C</strong>. This means multiple apps can control the bike if you are not careful.  When beginning a new training session, I start <strong>TrainerDay</strong> first (BT-1), then the <strong>Stages Link</strong> app (BT-2) and then Garmin 520 (Ant+ FE-C).  This sequence seems to allow  <strong>TrainerDay</strong> to control the bike without interference.</p>\n<p><code>I have worked in the communications and software industry for 40 years.  Setting up my Stages Bike was challenging for me. I have no idea how most people deal with this level of technology. It does explain some of the problems however :( </code></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>IMHO <em>Smart Bikes</em>, like mine, are still in the <em>early adopter</em> phase. <em>Smart Trainers</em> are a bit further along. None of them have their software working perfectly. Resistance modelling is good but I think all smart bikes/trainers have difficulty replicating heavy-duty sprinting experiences. Similarly, I am not convinced that Erg Mode (as implemented by the Smart Bike/Trainer software) is as good as were are lead to believe.  Erg resistance to rapid acceleration feels very wrong to me. I think great Erg behaviour is still an iteration or two away.</p>\n<p>I also empathize with you: Platforms like Android, iOS, Windows and MacOS create a very challenging test environment.  I think you are right to stick with iOS and Android for trainer control - <em>for now</em>.</p>\n<p>Peloton does a better job serving consumer-level users by building both the hardware and software.  3rd party software control of smart bikes/trainers will take a bit longer.  <em>Please don\u2019t get discouraged.</em>  Products like <strong>TrainerDay</strong> are several orders of magnitude more useful than the Peloton-style alternatives.</p>",

I don\u2019t see hardware / software doing what outdoors does any time soon.</p>\n<p>Performance cycling is very convient inside (no stop lights, traffic\u2026), outside it\u2019s easier to just enjoy yourself with bouts of performance.  I believe the outdoor market can and should go more in the direction of the \u201ctop tube sticker\u201d for performance cycling and less in the direction of being glued to the computer screen.  I am working on a viable solution for this.  Even taking the polarized approach and doing 1 day a week of strict very hard interval session indoors and ta lot of outdoor forcus on easy rides is a good approach from my persepctive.</p>\n<p>I also feel that ERG mode is one tool in the toolbox.  I do also feel spin bike style (Peloton) training is another tool in that toolbox, especially in my case where my wife won\u2019t let me keep bikes in our apartment so I have an M3i spin bike (she likes it too).  It\u2019s nice because it is 100% silent.  Generally I like it.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your thoughts and compliment \u201corders of magnitude\u2026\u201d</p>",
