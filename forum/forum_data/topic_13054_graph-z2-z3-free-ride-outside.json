TSS focused charts push you one of two directions more intensity or more time. More intensity has been proven to be counter productive in many cases so generically recommending more intensity is a bad idea. Riding more, especially outdoors is the best way to improve your performance.</p>\n<p>See similar discussion here</p>\n<aside class=\"quote quote-modified\" data-post=\"2\" data-topic=\"10048\">\n  <div class=\"title\">\n    <div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/user_avatar/forums.trainerday.com/alex/48/1331_2.png\" class=\"avatar\">\n    <a href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/t/decreseasing-ftp/10048/2\">Decreseasing FTP <img width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=12\" title=\"frowning\" alt=\"frowning\" class=\"emoji\"></a> <a class=\"badge-category__wrapper \" href=\"/c/training-plans/9\"><span data-category-id=\"9\" style=\"--category-badge-color: #BF1E2E; --category-badge-text-color: #FFFFFF;\" data-drop-close=\"true\" class=\"badge-category \" title=\"This is anything related to training, primarily cycling training.

If you were stuck at a specific FTP for a long time this could be your case.  I also know this can be scary to see an FTP drop starting a new plan.  Our plans are not like TrainerRoad\u2019s or all the sweet spot plans out or even harder plans out there that are trying to give everyone immediate gratifica\u2026\n  </blockquote>\n</aside>\n\n<p>Basically anytime one of these charts tells someone they are going down hill they just start pushing harder. During a base period and early build that is very typical.

Your power can go back to 40% of FTP for a few minutes every where in a workout. Your HR gets higher during the workout and don\u2019t see how anybody can bring it back to 40% everywhere in a workout. The conversion of power to hr in the trainerday workouts looks unrealistic to me. Even with the conversion possibilities.<br>\nDepending one the kind of interval training my HR recovers from the max of the interval effort with 10, 15 up to 30 beats, Where the max of the effort goes up with 5, 7, 9 etc.<br>\nI think that with more realistic HR targets it is better to evaluate a training. RPE does not work for me. If my average HR is high given the average power I try to establish if there are reasons why the form of the day seems to be different. I don\u2019t need exact HR-targets, Just a better idea of the intensity of a workout is for both power and hr good in balance. With power into anaerobic and hr in endurance.

      "cooked": "<p>You can\u2019t do HIIT based on HR alone and that\u2019s what it is. The only thing that can give you a little information regarding progress and/or form during HIIT is the max HR you reached and the time you need to come back from that max HR to a fixed lower HR that you consider \u2018recovered\u2019. And here again, what is that fixed HR and what is a recovered HR and what is considered a normal time???<br>\nIf you can\u2019t reach the HR max that you usually reach, your body was not ready for the effort. If the HR drop takes longer then usual, same thing. These are signs that you better forget the HIT workout, do some easy spinning in endurance zone or even simply quit the session and allow your body to recover.<br>\nThere is no single champion basing HIIT training on HR alone. Not nowadays and not in the past. In the past they did them on RPE, now it\u2019s much more precise with power. The precision they get from power, allows them to get more Time-In-Zone for the HIT work, and that means more bang for the buck. Back in the days where even HR monitors were not existing, champions did that kind of intervals on a hill. They estimated effort based on RPE and crested that hill 8 or 10 or more times as prescribed by the coach. You would be amazed how good they were at judging their effort without any live information. Just a stopwatch to record the time needed to go up that hill. And the last one was almost exactly the same as the first one, but on the last one they were cooked.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"RobertS\" data-post=\"12\" data-topic=\"13054\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/user_avatar/forums.trainerday.com/roberts/48/3219_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> RobertS:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>more realistic HR targets</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Those targets will be different for each and every athlete, and will vary a lot from day to day.<br>\nFor VO2max workouts, you can set HR targets because the goal of those is to accumulate as much time as possible at a HR above 90% of max HR. The VO2max HIT workouts are typically short hard bursts with short rests, 30-30sec or 40-20sec for example. The goal is to get you in te correct HR zone and keep you there for as long as possible to have maximal TIZ and adaptation.</p>\n<p>You have both Power and HR, so there\u2019s no need to make things more complicated. Just use them wisely for the type of workout you\u2019re doing. Endurance and eventually longer Tempo work can be done with HR. Anything higher intensity is best done with power.</p>",

I totally misunderstood, I thought you were trying to say something totally diffent is why I brought up top athletes.</p>\n<p>So \u201ceveryone\u201d prescribes Aneraobic workouts, such as HIIT based on FTP % but in reality for some people this can be very wrong.  If you are strong or a sprinter type of profie for example, or just a low FTP compared to your strength.  We have articles on W\u2019 (pronounced w-prime) talking about this problem on our blog.   It\u2019s your anaerobic work capacity.  It\u2019s estimated that 80% of the people are average, but 20% are not.  I also am not.</p>\n<p>Traditional HIIT is pretty easy for me as well.  All I do is press the plus button in our app until I get to a place that it feels pretty hard but I am sure I could do more intervals at the end.</p>\n<p>My current FTP is low but strength is moderate so I could do that workout above at about 180% or possibly 200% of FTP if I really wanted to suffer.  I think HIIT is better done by feel like this, so the plus button in our app is perfect for that.</p>",
