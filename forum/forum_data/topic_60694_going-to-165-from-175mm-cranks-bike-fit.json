      "cooked": "<p>The core idea is as we age we lose mobility.  Now if you are consistent enough or doing enough mobility stuff you can slow that down obviously but regardless it will eventually happen.  So for you at your age the value might be much lower than it is for me and my mobility at my age.  The biggest take away that I see is more that their are not many down sides to going shorter.  Obviously in MTB or hard very short sprints their can be but this is not my concern.</p>\n<p>I have hamstring soreness on 80-100km rides (I just need to stand every 10 minutes for a bit or stretch it out to make it acceptable) and tried lots of different positional stuff.    Generally GPT feels the agreement is that shorter cranks will reduce the amount of extension required and very likely to help.</p>\n<p>Here are a couple comments from GPT for example.</p>\n<p><strong>Improved circulation</strong>: Less compression at the top of the stroke can improve blood flow, particularly helpful for older or heavier riders.</p>\n<p><strong>Reduced joint strain</strong>: Shorter cranks decrease the hip and knee flexion angle at the top of the pedal stroke, helping:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Those with hip impingement or arthritis</li>\n<li>Riders with limited hamstring or lower back flexibility</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Lower risk of pedal strikes</strong>: Useful on gravel bikes or during cornering.</p>\n<p>So again this is more for me and my specifics than a general improvement for all.  My guess is for you the cost vs value is not worth it at this time.  I doubt you will get any noticeable benefit unless you have specific issues you are trying to resolve.  If you regularly ride around at 50kph then you might get some aero benefits <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",

Overall in my case I am just trying to solve a specific hamstring problem other than that I would stay with 175.  I am adding spindle power meter which is essentially dual sided which is cool.  I use spacers to widen my pedals (could say bigger Q-factor even though technically that is the wrong term in this case) so that seems to throw off my single sided pedal power\u2026  So hopefully solving 2 problems at once.</p>",

I am not saying just because one day a specific workout is not super exciting to skip it, I am just saying overall align your goals with your training.</p>\n<p>I have slowly grown to realize that consistency is the only thing that matters (besides fun/pleasure)\u2026 So until you can master that no reason to work on anything else unless it is fun.  Following specific training plans and workouts can be super fun and add to consistency as well so it\u2019s great.  The obsession of data can be motivational.</p>",
