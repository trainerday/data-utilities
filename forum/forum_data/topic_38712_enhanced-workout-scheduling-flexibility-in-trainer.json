      "cooked": "<p>Currently, Coach Jack\u2019s plans allow users to select training days, maximum workout duration per day, and designate a \u201cLong Ride Day.\u201d I propose adding the following features to further personalize and optimize training plans:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Intensity Customization:</strong> Allow users to specify desired workout intensity for each day. This could be implemented using a scale (e.g., 1-5, with 1 being easy and 5 being very hard) or a simple \u201cEasy/Moderate/Hard\u201d selection. This would help users align their training with daily energy levels and commitments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Outdoor/Indoor Preference:</strong>  Introduce the option to indicate whether a workout is intended for outdoors or indoors. This recognizes the potential differences in workout experience and allows for better planning.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Improved Integration with Daily Life:</strong>  Intensity customization enables users to schedule harder workouts on days with more time and energy, and easier workouts on busier days.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Optimized Training:</strong>  Acknowledging the distinction between outdoor and indoor workouts helps users tailor their plans to their specific goals and circumstances.</li>\n</ul>",
