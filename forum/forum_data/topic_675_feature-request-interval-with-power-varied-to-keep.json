One related feature could be a \u2018ramp up\u2019 period, where you can specify starting watts, a power increase amount per unit time to get to the heart rate if power needs to be increased initially. So you might start out at 60bpm and want to ride for 25 minutes at 145bpm - so you specify a starting watts of 100, 10% increase in FTP watts per minute to get to 145 bpm initially, then 25 minutes at 145 bpm. Thanks for considering. Cheers Anthony</p>",

I am currious if you or anyone else interested in this feature plan to only use it for Z1 or Z2 work or similar.  I am not sure what to do about trying to control it on the harder efforts.

      "cooked": "<p>Intuitively my first reaction would be twofold:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It will be very difficult to adjust power with the purpose of remaining in a small HR zone. HR easily has artefacts. Stand up on your pedals to reseat your bum, take your water bottle to drink, burp, have a deep breath, etc. will all have an impact on your HR while it should not influence resistance because those are short HR changes that have nothing to do with your physiological response on the workout. So you should already look at longer averages or an integrated/differentiated signal. That on its turn will cause problems when you have a step from one interval to another.</li>\n<li>It seems like overcomplicating things. I\u2019m absolutely not against HR training, on the contrary. But I think we all agree that HR targets should only be used for longer steady state work. It\u2019s not that difficult to match a Power zone with a HR zone for that kind of work. So just set your Power target and analyze the HR post workout. There can be a lot of information gathered from steady state workouts to check if you\u2019re improving. The P/HR ratio for different zones or part of zones is a very nice metric. But there is also the decoupling, maybe even sensitive to smaller changes. How much is the decoupling if I ride 1 hour at xW? And how much bigger is the decoupling if I ride the same power target for 2 hours? Am I up to that kind of power for that time\u2026 These 2 metrics can give you some very good insight on how much you improve for steady state work at low Z2 to high Z3 work. And it\u2019s easy to do like that, by targeting Power (external load) and measuring HR (internal load). So why would you want to achieve the same thing by targeting HR and measuring Power? It\u2019s something much more difficult to achieve and it isn\u2019t giving you anymore information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I do all my Low Intensity work indirectly based on HR by setting power targets that get me in the correct HR zone. Mostly \u201cbelow AeT\u201d. When I see that my HR dropped 2-3 bpm for the same workout, I add a couple of Watts to the target and get on. When I see that decoupling over a 1 hour AeT workout drops below 3%, I add 1 or 2 beats to what I consider my AeT HR and check if decoupling raises again to about 5%. (This is based on the AeT method of uphill athlete)</p>\n<p>All my High Intensity work (not much <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\">) is based on the Power Distribution Curve and has Power Targets without paying much attention to HR.</p>\n<p>I never do dedicated FTP tests. I use Xert\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s my FTP \u201c IQ field or the eFTP from Intervals to set an FTP that is somewhat in the ballpark. Not because I want to know my FTP but because a fair estimate of FTP is mandatory to get the load and the PMC chart correct.</p>\n<p>Is that making sense?</p>\n<p>Will do some more thinking about the HR regulated workout and maybe I\u2019ll change my mind. The above is just some \u201cthinking out loud\u201d so anybody is welcome to add his opinion on the subject and totally disagree with me.</p>",
