      "cooked": "<p>Hey,</p>\n<p>I did recently a 105\u2019 workout in HR mode, and I must say first: no slowing timer so far. <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=9\" title=\":grinning:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":grinning:\"><br>\nBut it did some weird things at the beginning and the end.<br>\nI set the target to 122bpm, and started pedalling with high cadence, and I outputted about 130w, because I was in the middle gear. I think resistance was below that power. It seemed that either HR target was used as power target or HR target didn\u2019t increase the resistance as I was pedalling more watts as HR mode wanted. So I was pedalling 5 minutes 130w with around 110bpm. No increase in resistance. After this first 5 minutes I pressed + and - to check if that helps, and it seemed at the first view that power = HR target, because with 140bpm target I did 140w. I switched than from HR to ERG and pressed there + to do the workout in ERG mode, but it started at 100w, and because I didn\u2019t wanted to press so often +, I switched back to HR mode, and wanted to put HR target to power target. So set it to 160bpm, and boom power increased to 250w or something, had to decrease the hr target back to 122bpm, and then hr mode worked as expected.<br>\nI put TD in background while pedalling simultaneously in FulGaz. After 103\u2019 I wanted to add 5\u2019 and TD was not usable at all, it didn\u2019t show the graph and was totally unresponsive. Pressed the +5m two times but didn\u2019t see if it worked as it was unresponsive. I did a screenshot and there you see it added the 10m, but no graph and can\u2019t say when the time was added.<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/206005a2743ea518587d57e9c4b8b46c960f3f41.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/206005a2743ea518587d57e9c4b8b46c960f3f41\" title=\"IMG_1152\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/206005a2743ea518587d57e9c4b8b46c960f3f41_2_690x479.png\" alt=\"IMG_1152\" data-base62-sha1=\"4Cp0ke8gdZoxbTQYtBrRfALdHX3\" width=\"690\" height=\"479\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/206005a2743ea518587d57e9c4b8b46c960f3f41_2_690x479.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/206005a2743ea518587d57e9c4b8b46c960f3f41_2_1035x718.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/206005a2743ea518587d57e9c4b8b46c960f3f41_2_1380x958.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/206005a2743ea518587d57e9c4b8b46c960f3f41_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">IMG_1152</span><span class=\"informations\">2360\u00d71640 143 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>I put it then back to background. But it immediately decreased the power to 130w again (as in the beginning), HR did go down below 110bpm, and no increase in power to get again to the target HR.  But HR mode didn\u2019t seem to work anymore. After 4 minutes I then changed the gear to the highest gear, to output some more watts (HR mode was setting the trainer still to the lowest resistance I think) and because of that HR increased then again.<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/0/04fb4be2d4bc409492018211dd54fa4eacec94c6.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/04fb4be2d4bc409492018211dd54fa4eacec94c6\" title=\"IMG_1154\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/04fb4be2d4bc409492018211dd54fa4eacec94c6_2_690x387.jpeg\" alt=\"IMG_1154\" data-base62-sha1=\"I4jdDDswzKC8brmE3Nxz5pTFDU\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/04fb4be2d4bc409492018211dd54fa4eacec94c6_2_690x387.jpeg, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/04fb4be2d4bc409492018211dd54fa4eacec94c6_2_1035x580.jpeg 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/04fb4be2d4bc409492018211dd54fa4eacec94c6_2_1380x774.jpeg 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/04fb4be2d4bc409492018211dd54fa4eacec94c6_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">IMG_1154</span><span class=\"informations\">2179\u00d71224 255 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",
