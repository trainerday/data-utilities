My thoughts: 1. All these zones are constructs; there isn\u2019t even a sharp bend in the lactat-curve and the body is at every intensity burning a mixture of carbs and fats. So it\u2019s not about flipping a switch. 2. Why is nobody talking about nutrition? Eat a low/zero carb, moderate protein, high fat meal for dinner, sleep and do your workout in a fasted state the next morning; some HIT-Intervalls in the beginning to burn the remaining carb storage \u2013 and than your body is using almost only fats for the rest of the time. (Edit: I have now read a bit more discussions in this forum, and have seen there is a lot of Keto mentioned. So maybe my post is just stating the obvious.)</p>",

We obviously have metobolic changes that happen in the body.  We call one of these \u201cZone 2.\u201d  Zone 2 power is less useful then zone 2 heart rate.  Z2 HR is probably closer to ones AeT/LT1 and Zone 2 is much friendlier and simpler way of thinking of it.</p>\n<p>Dr Seiler suggests easy and hard but some days sweet spot is moderate and some days it\u2019s hard.  It depends on duration and % of FTP and ultimately how you are feeling/performing that day.</p>\n<p>I would say training is less controversial or does not insight as much passion as diet related stuff does.  I don\u2019t mind discussing it but I try to be more inclusive of other peoples beliefs.  There are many smart people that have very different opinions.  In both training and diet but I feel like evidence based science and the best coaches have more alignment in training.</p>\n<p>I personally try to minimize process carbs (try is the key word) and eat carbs after fiber, fat and protien, but I don\u2019t think super low carbs, especially healthy ones is the best idea.   It\u2019s pretty hard to imagine that fresh broccoli is a bad idea.  I also think it depends on you as an individual.  Some of us are more carb intollerage or insulin resistant than others.  For the later, watching carbs or at the minimum watching glucose/insulin spikes and sustained elevation levels becomes more important.  I fall into this group but for others carbs can be a reasonable source of energy.</p>\n<p>I do think much of the cycling industry is a bit too adicticted to quick fix processed carbs, especially while cycling but if they don\u2019t have any negatives (excess inflamation\u2026 weight gain\u2026) due to this, I am not sure the harm is the end of the world.  As we know as you age things change and we have to get better and matching our diet to our body.</p>\n<p>I am also huge proponent of sleep.  I think this group here is a bit different then say the TR crowd.  Many of us are older and theoretically wiser and just trying to find what works with us.  Been in years of debates about what is best and ready to just move on.  As I said I love discussing this stuff in a positive way.  I and one other user here get in deep discussions over very different opinions.  Calories In/Out vs insulin and after lots of talking have come to a pretty similar mutual opinion on this matter <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",

With the risk of being too off-topic (and apologises to the TO): I really appreciate the general tone of this community \u2013not so much hard core semi-pro racing style, but more general fitness, health, longevity focused. At least as far as I read in the last few hours. And I just have ordered the Maffetone Method book. I knew his training principles, but had no idea, how holistic his approach is.

Interesting videos available on the comparison between them.  Where you even learn that for one person the different constructs align quite well, while for another person they are significantly different.<br>\nThat said, the way I look at it is very pragmatic : the zones for me are about what is the main energy system that is being used.  And I agree with kstoeb : it\u2019s not an on/off switch, it\u2019s more about the dominant system.  I has an interesting experience this week on exactly that topic.  After the hint of Alex I started reading the work of Dr. Maffetone.  I want to loose some weight before a big cycling challenge in July, so I changed my nutrition. Not in a religious way.  But I basically stripped all processed foods and avoid as much carbs as possible.  2 finding : I am loosing ways after about 2 weeks.  But : I\"m struggling with the training schedule I\u2019ve been doing for several months now.  Yes, I also got a cold and there\u2019s different other things that might impact it but : clearly my nutrition has something to do with it. Last night I had a HIIT session planned, which I felt I simply wouldn\u2019t be able to do with the \u201cMaffetone food\u201d only.  So I got myself a gel before the training and one during the training blocks.  It worked <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  Is this scientific.

I believe this is what got this female pro cyclist disqualified in the Strade and this makes total sense.  I was looking for one that I can buy actually, the one the pros are using can\u2019t be bought where I live.<br>\nAnd my bigger ambition is still to look into non invasive lactate meter technology that gives permanent feedback <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",

As you can imagine gels are not healthy but for sure they work.  I also try to keep processed carbs at minimum and am ok with my weight but happy to lose a little more.  Some times I just need a carb boost to feel motivated.  I use something called GlycoFuse.  I am convinced it is healthier but that might not be true.  Less glycimic rush but still gives that required energy.  It\u2019s kind of expensive but I don\u2019t have it very often.  It\u2019s made for serious long term endruance athletes but I use it is a quick energy boost so the designed use case.  I have not tested it with glucose monitor yet.</p>\n<p>Yes the female pro got busted, it seems strange.</p>\n<p>Apple is working on non-invasive.  It will be amazing if it happens.   Almost all the systems use the same one, Freestyle Libre 2/3.  In Europe you can buy them online.  I was buying them on Ebay.</p>",

Keep your HR lower then 180-age and make sure that you hydrate enough. Use a fan, or better multiple fans, to make sure that you\u2019re not overheating. Overheating and dehydration are significantly reducing performance.<br>\n3.5hr indoor is clearly not something that you can handle at this moment. Ease into it by working up from 2-2.5hr. Give your body enough time to adapt. Overdoing it, will set you back, so give it some time.</p>",
