      "cooked": "<p>Hi all,</p>\n<p>pretty new to TD. Just started my first CJ training plan this week. So far pretty happy with the plan. Been tinkering around with all the connections though. I use intervals.icu as my primary \u201csource of truth\u201d. All my rides are uploaded there. I have a free Strava account as well but don\u2019t really like using it. Same goes for Trainingpeaks. I\u2019d like to keep it simple and only use TD, intervals, and my wahoo bike computer.</p>\n<p>I used my wahoo and the TD app both for one workout to figure out which I like better. I prefer the wahoo just for the simplicity and consistency - it\u2019s what I use for my outdoor workouts as well.</p>\n<p>However, I didn\u2019t find a way to upload my completed workouts from wahoo to TD without going through Strava. Intervals.icu downloads them just fine but TD seems to have no option for that. As initially mentioned, I\u2019d like to avoid using Strava.</p>\n<p>That brings me to my actual question: do I need the completed workouts in TD or does it not matter? Does TD or CJ work with my results at all, as in overall training progression, ramping up, suggesting follow up training plans once I complete my initial one. Or is it enough to input my updated FTP and weekly workout hours, once I completed the current plan?</p>\n<p>Thanks for you advice!</p>\n<p>PS: if you have a better suggestion to linking those accounts/workouts, I\u2019m happy to take that into consideration as well <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",

Right now Strava is the only way to get completed workouts other than our app into TrainerDay.  I would say what you are requesting is to have direct integration with Intervals in that we show completed activities from Intervals in TD or Intervals&gt;dropbox&gt;TD for example.  Not sure why you don\u2019t like Strava but you can always create a hidden account that no one knows about.  But I can appreciate it if you just don\u2019t want your data there.</p>",

Then why use it?</p>\n<p>So there is no \u201cfeedback loop\u201d into CJ from completed workouts? I was hoping to see some feature that would assess my training success and suggest follow-up training plans to fit my progression. Seems like this is (currently) not an implemented feature?</p>\n<p>On a side note: I saw that I can manually tag workouts as completed on the TD calendar. However, it seems to not count them as \u201cwork done\u201d as the stress is not added into the weekly goal.
