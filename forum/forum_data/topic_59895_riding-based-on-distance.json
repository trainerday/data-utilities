      "cooked": "<p>Would it be possible to add mode based on distance and slope? There is mode based on HR, ERG and slope but what I find missing (or I maybe I don\u2019t know how to set it up) is workout based on distance. Use case: I have a specific climb I\u2019d like to ride. I can import rout in .grx format but it doesn\u2019t simulate distance. What I\u2019m looking for is something similar to Zwift free ride mode. E.g.: instead of riding 2 minutes on 5% slope, I\u2019d like to have possibility to ride 1km on 5% slope.<br>\nHope, I\u2019m clear enough.</p>\n<p>ps. great app. I\u2019m using it for almost 2 years <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi, it is not possible to do this.  The problem is the way we display those charts, is they move 1 second at a time and bluetooth devices transmit that information 1 second at a time.  So it would essentially take a complete re-write to make it so moving a specific distance at a time.  I do think this is a cool feature it\u2019s just too complicated.  Not to promote another app but biketerra is currently the winner in this space is my belief.  I have talked to the guy there (Matt) a lot and he is a good guy.</p>\n<p>I should say obviously that there is not a meaningful difference between time and distance if you hit approximately the same watts.  But if you changed your FTP or W\u2019 a lot then it can matter a lot.  I realize that distance is just nice since it matches the real world.</p>",
