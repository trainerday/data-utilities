However, to design the training sessions, I need to log into their respective accounts, which is confusing and time consuming. I know that Coach Jack is something relevant to self trained TrainerDay users, but has any type of coach mode been considered, where I can manage and cover the costs of my athletes\u2019 accounts, accessing their calendars and prescribing workouts?</p>",

Intervals obviously being the much more cost effective solution.  Your athlete\u2019s just need to create their Intervals account and connected TD to Intervals and enable WOD, for example but then they don\u2019t need to use Intervals if they don\u2019t want to.</p>",
