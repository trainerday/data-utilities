      "cooked": "<p>Yep this is typical endurance rides from a power perspective.  We are not pure polarized believers but follow a similar belief system that most of your rides should be easy.  But yes you should be able to tweak CJ to get it exactly like you like it.  Like stated create a custom plan with 3 workouts of your choice and don\u2019t put them 2 days in a row and you won\u2019t get any zone 2 if you don\u2019t want it.  If you need harder just crank up the intensity slider.  Just remember hard winters followed by hard springs and summers usually lead to burn out. So in a typical racer periodization fashion winter should be preparing you for a harder spring.  Everything in training is very individual and requires some personal experimentation and adjustments to fully match your desires and life. We always suggest doing what is fun as long as it does not compromise your health (too much).</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Last winter I did mainly Z2 rides.  Is it boring?  well, Netflix helps.  Instead of sitting just in front of a television on the couch, I\u2019d figured I could as well sit on my bike.  The result : Garmin and Strava didn\u2019t get it, but when it got to spring time, I had made some real solid progress.  Resulting in a summer of fun.  Just ignore what the charts are saying, boring Z2 rides are not good for their device or subscription sales <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> \u2026  The thing I did notice : I improved big time on my basic endurance level (read : my Z2 power was up 20% for the same heartrate), but my Aerobe treshold didn\u2019t go up with the same values.  I would assume a bit normal, since I didn\u2019t do any VO2 of HIIT work.  So for this winter, just for fun, I decide to change the approach slightly : 4-5 days of Z2, 1-2 days of VO2/HIIT.  A rest day when I feel like I need it, skipping one of the harder training session.  It\u2019s all not completely scientific, but I\u2019m a 50+ cyclist just planning to do some events/gran fondos in the summer.  I started doing this when the weather turned bad over here (which was in October and there\u2019s stil no improvement in the weather).  First results are amazing.  both Z2 as the aerobic treshold seem to be moving in the right direction.  No \u201ccycling proof\u201d yet (the road are literally flooded over here, so no outdoor riding).  But : all number are trending in the right direction and I went skiing last week.  It literally felt like I was 35 again\u2026  I could just keep going\u2026   Just my experience\u2026</p>",

Now if previous years you averaged 10 hours a week for the whole year, this may not be as effective but the difference is more how you feel.  After this base period you are just seriously hungry for harder efforts and as you start to do more effort you get immediate benefits having this solid base.</p>\n<p>Each person is so unique as well as goals and expectations that\u2019s it\u2019s not exactly easy to answer that question.

So : just before New Year, I got a hefty cold.  A real bad one\u2026  Read : couple of days not on the bike.  Since Jan 4 I was able to get back to cycling.  But how do you normally do that?  Studies tell : start \u201ceasy\u201d again, if you overdo it, it will do more harm than any good.  TADA : HR based training !  For the first couple of days, I put the HR target at 110, which is somewhere low Z2, high Z1.  and did just an hour of spinning around.  The fun of it : if you feel the sickness is still there, stop it.  If you feel you just had a dip in your fitness, the average power will tell you.  And better still: over the days after, I could see the average power for the same HR trending back up.  It\u2019s not only an efficient way to get back on track, but probably also a safe way.  You\u2019re not overdoing it by design.  And if you sickness is not yet out of your body, your power numbers will tell you.  But you\u2019re not putting any stress level on your heartrate\u2026</p>",
