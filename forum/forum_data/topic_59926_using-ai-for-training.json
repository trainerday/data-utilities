So yes, both Andrea and I have spent years playing with AI to generate training plans.  I have been working with GPT (and all the main LLMs) ever since I heard about GPT, trying to get it to work for TrainerDay.   It\u2019s incredibly powerful in the hands of the RIGHT USER.  One problem is it latches on to the details you provide it and it skews it\u2019s results too heavily based on that information, but will choose to mostly ignore other important information.  If you know what you are looking for you can keep bothering it until it fixes it\u2019s answers.  So let\u2019s say it\u2019s a great tool for people that understand LLMs and understand training very well.</p>\n<p>So with all these issues and the limited scope I have struggled with how to use it in TD.  Not to mention is we try to keep our costs low and simple and it does not fit very well into that.  But I finally feel I have a way to bring the value of LLMs into TD <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> and we are starting to move forward with this soon.</p>\n<p>For health/medical related dietary and recipes it\u2019s unbelievable.  In the last 3-months I have designed the perfect way of eating for me and the rest of my family has benefited as well.</p>\n<p>You could share a link to your GPT discussion as private message to me if you wanted.  I would love to see it.</p>",

For me I would say all of it\u2019s advice is very, very bad but very main stream for highly competitive athletes.  Now if you or I see that we say\u2026 oh my no, no, no\u2026 <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> and we can explain why.</p>\n<p>So the results are that TrainerDay needs to put all kinds of constraints to make sure the plan is good for the athlete and keep generating versions until it gets it right.  From a ChatGPT api standpoint this gets expensive and it limits what is possible for the user to do.  Eventually it ends up with Coach Jack plans <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">   But no, I would like to not limit it to our beliefs and let people do what they want but need to put some constraints on it, or have 2 modes.</p>\n<p>PS: I tried to fix this plan above with some feedback and it gave me another bad plan of only zone 1 and zone 2 training rides\u2026</p>",

You can tell it stuff, but the memory fills up very quickly and then you just end up deleting other memories.  It may know stuff in the moment, but isn\u2019t able to retain very much.  I would say as an all encompassing coach who would adapt plans, etc\u2026 it is poor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you give it a goal statement, constraints, strengths, and limiters I think it will give a reasonable suggestion on what a good work out plan is.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I think it is actually fairly good to giving feedback from a specific outdoor rides or workouts.  If I copy/paste Garmin lap data it will offer useful data with observations, suggestions, etc\u2026</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you have specific questions I think it generally does a good job with feedback.
