This is in Italian (I added some English over it) but you can see there is always a relationship between force and rpm to produce power.  This left top quadrant is something that most non-pro riders don\u2019t train.  They might do sprints of short duration high force that are briefly in this quadrant but not sustained (strength/endurance) like low RPM can produce. \nIf you do VO2max or HIIT workouts they still don\u2019t produce enou\u2026\n  </blockquote>\n</aside>\n\n<p>I believe it makes knees stronger if you do it right but you should start with shorter intervals and move to longer.  Really in the 55 range Andrea would suggest doing Z5\u2026 which is way more stressful.  We have both Z2 and Z5 low RPM workouts in Coach Jack. So you could also go to higher torque from where you are but easing into it is a good idea.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi Quinnrm,</p>\n<p>Good work on the work-outs and a very good question. The evidence is limited because the questions they ask are often the same.</p>\n<p>In low cadence research they compare the work-outs to strength training with weights. And, of course, in every research the conclusion is that you can become stronger with weights.</p>\n<p>But the purpose is not to find a way to build the strongest muscles. One purpose of of low cadence training is to make the knee stronger in the specific motion of cycling. Another purpose is to train and feel the power you need to climb. You can\u2019t mimic that with weights.</p>\n<p>So, low purpose training is a usefull tool to use. For my clients, I use zone 2/3 blocks to strengthen the knee in early season and zone 5 later in the season as a climb interval.</p>\n<p>Researh shows that, in general, adjusting your cadence to produce a certain power is not beneficial for amatures in terms of getting the best fitness effect from that interval. You\u2019re own prefered candene is far more effective.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t train cadence. I use the warm up to do cadence sessions. They don\u2019t have to be long. You can do 30 second intervals, starting at 80rpm and add 10 rpm every 30 seconds until you are bouncing on your saddle. Take one minute rest and repeat. Important is that you don\u2019t gear up. Choose a low gear and keep it there. Yes, it looks ridiculous, but it is very effective.</p>\n<p>The blocks you are doing are good to do too. I suggest you save these blocks for when you have reached a basic level of fitness that you are happy with. Use the same principle I just gave you for the high cadence, instead of gearing up, gear down and keep the speed the same so you have to use a higher cadence.</p>\n<p>The benefit of these workouts is that you will be more comfortable with different cadences.</p>\n<p>Keep up the good work.</p>\n<p>Have fun, Coach Robert</p>",

I probably should\u2019ve looked deeper into the plan when CJ built it but I decided I would just trust the process and stick to it.</p>\n<p>Coming off a recovery week I decided to do both a TD Ramp test and then later in the week throw in a 4DP workout outdoors to see where I stood.  What I found out most was that pacing the 20 minute effort was a challenge.  Heading into a TT I should know how to pace it but with no workouts on the plan like it would be a challenge.</p>\n<p>What I\u2019m planning to do is replace my Saturday Z2/3 outdoor rides with a block of 3x10\u2019s, 3x12\u2019s, or over-unders, sandwiched between an hour-ish of Zone 2 depending on the length of the ride. It will be outdoors and I have a good area to do this.</p>\n<p>Any feedback would be appreciated.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Good questions.  Dynamic force is not about hard efforts they are about sustained higher torque.  I would say the bigger factor if you should adjust them to be harder is how strong you are and how strong your tendons and ligaments are.  If you can squat 2X your body weight then you aer very strong for example and they will be very low risk for you.  If you are hard core MTBer going up steep stuff with high watts and low cadence then yes crank it up.  If you are not a strength guy or MTB hill climber then you are probably better off starting with a few of these first.  After the first two see how it feels.  You can go to your calendar at the top and edit the plan and just change it and it will automatically update the calendar.</p>\n<p>You are absolutely correct for 40k TTer you should be doing threshold.  Long ride is usually something very beneficial in general for aerobic improvement but for the last month of your peak period focusing on specificity becomes ultra important.  What you can do is click on the custom plan type and select the sequences you want and replace your long ride with our threshold blocks\u2026 For this peak period consider cranking up the intensity.  We still believe more in progression then doing the same super hard workouts each week but they can start your peak period as hard and move to super hard right be fore your main event.</p>",

First, it takes a while for zone 2 to get truly effective. That is why these workouts are so much longer. Second, after high intensity work, it takes the body up to 45 minutes to burn all the lactate as a fuel, so it is only after these 45 minutes that zone 2 starts to be effective again.</p>\n<p>It makes more sense to either do it at the end of your lsd training or replace on of the interval sessions during the week.</p>\n<p>Have fun, Coach Robert</p>",

I\u2019ll hold steady on the Dynamic Force work and see how it goes for the first session or two before making any judgements.</p>\n<p>As for the threshold work sandwiched by Z2, I get it based on what Inigo San Milan said in the past about how it takes awhile for the body to drop back down into Z2 if you go too hard early in a session.  But let\u2019s look at my VO2 max session for today.  VO2 max <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#7</span>, after the final interval at 45 minutes, there is essentially another 45 minutes of Z2.</p>\n<p>If this is true about doing Z2 after, then what\u2019s the point of this workout?  If it can take 45 minutes to come down then is this volume for the sake of volume?  Is there no value to the last 45 minutes other than a cooldown?  I\u2019m not knocking the workout, just trying to drill down on it.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Like Alex points out, the most important thing is getting out there and doing things. I don\u2019t want to downplay the importance of theory, research, or myself, for that matter, but training on the bike is what yields results, and there are many ways to achieve them.</p>\n<p>It is never the case that an extra 45 minutes does nothing.  First of all, it might take up to 45 minutes, but it could be shorter, depending on various factors, such as intensity, your lactate threshold, and your ability to recover.</p>\n<p>There is also the point of fatigue resistance, which comes with more training. The thought behind fatigue resistance is that you could do your intervals first, and follow them up with easy riding.<br>\nIn the last weeks before your end goal you switch and do the easy riding first, followed by the intervals.</p>\n<p>The big idea is that in the beginning, you want to be fresh for the intensity part, so you can maximize growth. Towards the end of your period, you want to train yourself to do these intense efforts when you are already tired.</p>\n<p>Apart from Pogacar and Van der Poel, who start the final mid-race, the end of the race is where you still want to be as fresh as you can be. Like the Marmotte (Alps edition) that finishes on Alpe d\u2019Huez, Trois Ballons that finishes on La Planche des Belles Filles, Liege-Bastogne-Liege that has two of its hardest climbs in the last 20 km, Maratona Dolomiti that finishes on M\u00fcr dl Giat.</p>\n<p>Another important factor is that training is very personal too. If you don\u2019t like your training, you will never be consistent.</p>\n<p>On this matter, Alex and I are on the same page. I see that many cyclist kill themselves with too much high intensity. Most of the time for a few months a year, just to get into shape and do very little the rest of the year.<br>\nIt is so important to be consistent throughout the year. Take a short break every now and then, and keep building your load towards different peaks throughout the year.</p>\n<p>That is why you have the feeling that you aren\u2019t doing enough right now. That is a good feeling, but also necassary. You are building up towards a peak, followd by a taper, a race and a rest period. Than start the complete cycle again.</p>",

So I went ahead and did that and it seems to have applied the changes for the interval sessions.  I still think it might be a neat feature to be able to do it selectively, as Robert said, closer to the peak you want to really improve fatigue resistance, so that might be a nice way to do this.</p>\n<p>As for consistency, I\u2019ve done well with this.
