And after I set up the zones I could use the + and - buttons to change zones.<br>\nYou could let the user switch between these modes with a tap on the percentage value. Normal mode shows percentage and zone-mode shows the current zone. That way, I could change zones very easily and make fine adjustments if needed, when I switch to normal mode.</p>\n<p>The idea behind this feature request is to use the app for Peloton Power Zone live classes with a smart trainer. On demand classes are no problem, because you can download ZWO-files for them. But in a live class, the instructor calls out zones and you have to go to that zone.</p>",

I did not actually try it but plan to at some point.  So specifying your own zones has been asked a few times.  Allowing zone change clicks this is a first but I think others might find that useful as well.  I don\u2019t want to do either of these tasks right now but I will keep them in mind as they might be able to be combined with other requests.  Not sure if you pay much attention to that group.  I wonder how many smart trainer cyclists are using it.  I guess probably a lot of spin bike users (non-peloton bike users are).  With these feature it might appeal to a larger audience there. <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  But still not our focus but might increase my desire <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",

I know that some users are starting with a smart trainer and eventually buy the bike. In my case, a spinning bike won\u2019t fit in my basement due to the ceiling height. With the smart trainer, I can stand and then I have 1 cm to the ceiling. All spinning bikes (at least the better ones) are 2 - 3 cm higher and I couldn\u2019t stand while pedaling without bumping my head in the ceiling.</p>\n<p>But in general I can use the TD app for the Peloton spinning classes (using the +/+ buttons with 5% steps) and for the power zone classes I download the zwo files from <a href=\"https://app.homefitnessbuddy.com/peloton/powerzone/\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Power Zone Library &amp; Timing Tool for Peloton | Home Fitness Buddy</a> and import them in TD. I have to start pedaling about 3 seconds before the workout starts but then the workout matches the cues of the instructor.</p>",

I was thinking you meant the power zone pack (<a href=\"https://pzpack.com/\">https://pzpack.com/</a>) not the pure power zone workouts in Peloton.  Adding customized zones and potentially showing them in the app is probably very generic and benefits many people but + - for a zone is more unique but also is a creative style of riding even without using peloton.  Generally changing by zone gives people another way to do workouts by which I think is good for some training days.</p>",
