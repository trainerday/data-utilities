I\u2019ve already seen some good results and haven\u2019t even recovered from it. It adds on quite a bit of fatigue, so needs to be pretty individualized. Of course, there are always more standard Vo2 blocks that could be written out (riding at  110-120% of FTP for X amount of time).</p>\n<p>What does your riding experience look like?

      "cooked": "<p>Thanks Jeremy for the feedback. I am 57 and i used to train 5 days a week but realized it was too much cardio and it was eating up my muscles it looks like. My wife said i looked bad although i felt great. So now i am down to two or 3 times 1 hour a week and i alternate with strength training. Looks like it is working better. I used to have a garmin forerunner 245 and although i do not run, it was giving me a vo2max of 45 just by walking. I upgraded to a fenix 6 two weeks ago and it can connect to my flight trainer from 4i innovations. So now i can use power. After two weeks my vo2max is at 41. That may be more correct but i feel disappointed i guess.  I will redo a ftp test with the watch to see if it matches the one i go with trainer day. I assume this value is important on computing the vo2max. right now i am at 153 Watts. I found some workout on the site to improve vo2max. how often should i push and do them ? once a week to try to improve ? Not sure if i can improve though, maybe at my age it may be hard to do. Let me know what you think.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>So your watch is just comparing HR to speed and giving you an estimated VO2max, it\u2019s probably in the ball park but not an accurate VO2max measurement, I have a Garmin watch too as well as had Polar, so I have looked at this.  Since this is just an HR to speed/power relationship you just need to improve your aerobic system.  The primary aerobic increases in most individuals come from aerobic capacity not improving your VO2max.</p>\n<p>The primary way to improve aerobic capacity that will make your watch thing your VO2max is higher is by riding more <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  Lots of easy miles consistently over a long period of time does wonders.  Reducing from 5 hours a week to 3-hours a week will likely not help your aerobic system although at 57, depending on the intensity of your rides 5 days a week may not be the best for performance i.e. \u201cVO2max\u201d  unless 1 or 2 of those days is truely super easy recovery ride.  I would say 3-days a week with a 2-3 hour long ride on the weekends would likely bring you the highest benefit.</p>\n<p>The most common aerobic \u201cshortcut\u201d when you are on a small number of hours (3 per week for example) to improving your aerobic system is HIIT or Tabata intervals but each person is unique and what works best for you we can\u2019t say for sure.  Still 3-4 days with a one long ride is probably optimum and you should not need the HIIT workouts.  You can always try them and see if you like them.  I do small hours and do HIIT at 150% 40s on 20s rest but that is individual and you have to play with it.</p>\n<p>Something like this is a good place to start.</p><aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <a href=\"https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/hiit-with-proper-warm-up\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"01:59PM - 10 January 2020\">app.trainerday.com \u2013 10 Jan 20</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/362;\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/11094f468a908153756a4aa0f5444be442e92c7f_2_690x362.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/11094f468a908153756a4aa0f5444be442e92c7f_2_690x362.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/11094f468a908153756a4aa0f5444be442e92c7f_2_1035x543.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/11094f468a908153756a4aa0f5444be442e92c7f.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/11094f468a908153756a4aa0f5444be442e92c7f_2_10x10.png\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/hiit-with-proper-warm-up\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HIIT with decent warm-up 40-SEC ON</a></h3>\n\n<p>Most top coaches recommend a 20-minute warm-up.

It\u2019s okay if it\u2019s 3 days per week still, but maybe if you could increase the time on the bike on some of these days\u2026</p>\n<p>Assuming you are working with what you have now though, as a general recommendation I would say to start with less-intense efforts, then slowly build up to threshold extensive work (trying to built your FTP time-to-exhaustion out to 60minutes+ in the form of longer intervals). Do this for 2-3 weeks, rest and re-test then add some intensity on top of it for another 2-3 weeks (over/unders, FTP with sprints, etc)\u2026</p>\n<p>From that point you could decide on either a full block of Vo2 or another block of more general build and FTP training.</p>\n<p>From my experience I\u2019m not a huge fan of adding in HIIT type training each week as I feel this can be a little bit counter-productive depending on the systems you are building, but there <em>are</em> people who do this successfully. I would rather have a full block dedicated to more specific Vo2 Max and FTP limiters rather than mixing and matching with volume. It\u2019s definitely going to be unique for you, though.

HIIT seems to work when you are really short on time or don\u2019t want to do longer hard sessions (I find them easier).  I for example know a guy that does 1-hour a week total cycling with two 30-minute HIIT sessions (which is actually only abot 5 minutes of hard effort of the 30)\u2026 and maintains his 235 watt FTP\u2026   Still Jeremy\u2019s advice is more on the classic, solid recommendation front.  Building up TTE is the recommended approach by starting out easy and building slowly.</p>\n<p>Below is a very starter level threshold workout.  You could extend the entire workout to 1-hour, and then just keep increasing the length of the hard intervals slowly.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <a href=\"https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/threshold-block-starter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"07:43AM - 10 July 2020\">app.trainerday.com \u2013 10 Jul 20</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/362;\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4caf5aa198300a56ff443040ce35d293a6b6888d_2_690x362.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4caf5aa198300a56ff443040ce35d293a6b6888d_2_690x362.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4caf5aa198300a56ff443040ce35d293a6b6888d_2_1035x543.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/4caf5aa198300a56ff443040ce35d293a6b6888d.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4caf5aa198300a56ff443040ce35d293a6b6888d_2_10x10.png\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/threshold-block-starter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Threshold Block Starter #0</a></h3>\n\n<p>If you have not done many threshold intervals lately this is the perfect 30-minute workout.</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n",

      "cooked": "<p>Alex and Jeremy, thank you for these awesome advice. Vo2max on a garmin requires a power meter. I can only do that indoor with my smart trainer. If i go outside for the long weekend ride, i would have to purchase power meter pedals and doubt i am going to do that. I had a polar and it would tell me i had a vo2max of 51. big difference with garmin.  I noticed that i lost a point with my vo2max when the watch told me to sprint 6 times at twice my ftp for 20 seconds and i was not able to maintain the 317 Watts required during the full 20 seconds. I will work more on building anaerobic load as i have a deficiency there. Ok, i\u2019ll look at the workout you suggested. Best</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Yes sorry, when you said watch, my mind merged running and cycling together so when I said speed I really meant running pace. I think stages and 4iii are both doing a good 299$ power meter these days but you want to make sure if you get one of those you plan on sticking with your bike for a while.   I do think the low cost power meters are coming\u2026 not sure when but we should be able to get something for $100-150 <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>I would say that 2X recommendation is a bit arbitrary as you point out that is based on anerobic and very individual.  Saying your anaerobic is not good at 2X is like saying your FTP is not good becasue it is not 300.  You don\u2019t need to have the same anerobic / aerobic relationship as someone else.  For sprinters with low ftp 2X for 20s is easy (I fall into that category) but for natural TTers it can be impossible.  You might need work there but that test is not a clear indicator of that.  Sounds like you are on the right path.</p>",
