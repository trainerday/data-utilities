I was taking my usual 20 minute power test before each block (yes I prefer this to a ramp test, specifically because I like that it forces me to practice pacing at high power) and I was able to do an even paced 421 watt average for 20 minutes. I finally reached an estimated FTP of 400! Here is the workout from TD:<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a37e6f1153b1af650799a8aefe9ab89d99dd2738.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/a37e6f1153b1af650799a8aefe9ab89d99dd2738\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/a37e6f1153b1af650799a8aefe9ab89d99dd2738_2_690x392.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"nkkI4ZePOsVD5FCw6Xb4jJJxNPO\" width=\"690\" height=\"392\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/a37e6f1153b1af650799a8aefe9ab89d99dd2738_2_690x392.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/a37e6f1153b1af650799a8aefe9ab89d99dd2738_2_1035x588.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a37e6f1153b1af650799a8aefe9ab89d99dd2738.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"C7D0E7\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1175\u00d7669 73.4 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>I wanted to share this to show the success that an athlete can have using TrainerDay and also show my appreciation to Alex and whoever else is a part of the App. As someone who is self-coached, TrainerDay has been invaluable in my pursuit of performance and racing success. At the beginning of my 2 year journey, Coach Jack\u2019s plans helped me build a great foundation. As someone who trains and optimizes my life relentlessly, I rapidly progressed and while I still use Coach Jack to generate my plans and workouts and schedule them out, I now personalize them a bit to add more intensity when I think I need it. Creating and finding workouts is also a breeze, and following them in real time on my turbo is simple.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m unashamed to admit that I promote TrainerDay at every chance I get because I really do believe in this product. So thank you again.</p>",

I\u2019ve taken lots of bits of advice from your responses to questions.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t mind me asking, how closely do you work on TD? Would you have access to view user\u2019s training plans or workouts?</p>\n<p>Reason I ask is that my race season ended last month, and my next race is not until May 2025. I\u2019m obviously very interested in keeping my fitness throughout the winter, and while I have made a custom plan with Coach Jack and trust the overall strategy, I\u2019d be very interested in having someone as experienced as yourself take a look at it and give me your opinions on how you would structure training blocks leading up to the race next Spring.</p>\n<p>Either way, thanks for your content and what you provide with TD. It is a great training app.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi ScottQc,</p>\n<p>I could share the stock plans I used, but I don\u2019t think you would necessarily get a great idea on my training history from just the plan.</p>\n<p>I use Coach Jack to set up my schedule for daily training, along with how much time per day and how many days per week leading up to an event on my calendar. So for me I train 6 days per week. 5 of the days I have a max time I can train which is 2 hours. Then the 6th day I can go a bit longer, but even then I try not to be gone really long every weekend because I have a young family.</p>\n<p>So then Coach Jack will create the overall outline of what to do each day. For the most part, I will follow the plan. When it calls for Z2 endurance rides, I do the endurance rides. When it is recovery, I take the recovery ride. I usually always go the full 2 hours, since I basically have a volume ceiling I just do as much as I can all the time.</p>\n<p>The key workout days is where I go off the rails a bit. I still follow the general idea of the plan. Meaning if it is a VO2 block, I do VO2 workouts, if it is Threshold Block, I do Threshold workouts. I just usually end up making them a lot harder than Coach Jack\u2019s workouts. Now I\u2019ll warn you, I truly believe that Coach Jack\u2019s workouts are effective and most people should use them. However, I\u2019m very unusual in that I can grind myself to dust day in and day out and never lose motivation or consistency. I love hard workouts. I workout at 4:30am most mornings, and I\u2019m one of those people who can pop out of bed without an alarm because I\u2019m looking forward to the VO2 workout I have that morning.</p>\n<p>As an example, here is a threshold workout I did a couple weeks ago:<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/5/57d6bc90db92d483dd3c14ffb252d6e63fdca653.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/57d6bc90db92d483dd3c14ffb252d6e63fdca653\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/57d6bc90db92d483dd3c14ffb252d6e63fdca653_2_690x449.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"cx3BSsqQil2MYCE5oWyfEGWTggb\" width=\"690\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/57d6bc90db92d483dd3c14ffb252d6e63fdca653_2_690x449.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/57d6bc90db92d483dd3c14ffb252d6e63fdca653_2_1035x673.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/5/57d6bc90db92d483dd3c14ffb252d6e63fdca653.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"CCD4E9\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1217\u00d7793 80.9 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>Now I know the workout name is 3x20, but I actually modified it to be 2x30. So you can see I did 2 intervals of 30 min at 365w-368w. Then I followed it with another 30 minutes of endurance. Coach Jack\u2019s threshold workouts don\u2019t come close to 30 min per interval. And like I said I think that is for good reason for most people. Suggesting workouts like these without absolute certainty of the athlete would spell disaster in many cases.</p>\n<p>If you have any more questions don\u2019t hesitate to ask. Good luck training!</p>",

Tayno\u2019s win in these two years is mainly due to his consistency in his training. You can see his dedication getting up at 4:30 in the morning. That is not for everyone.</p>\n<p>The key to consistency is finding a way to repeat every week for the whole year.<br>\nWhen I take on new clients, I always take them on for a whole year. I don\u2019t do 3-month programs. And this is exactly why.<br>\nEveryone can commit to training hard for three months. So, after you ride your event, you\u2019re happy, but now it is time for a break. Next, you look forward to getting on the bike again because you know what you need to do to get this good again.</p>\n<p>I ask my clients, \u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d How much time can you realistically spend on training without conflicting with your family life, job, mind, and life?</p>\n<p>The important lesson is that you will get better by doing less but consistently, than by doing more but inconsistently.</p>\n<p>If your read between the lines this takes much more than a training schedule.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>He gets up early, meaning he needs to go to bed 8 hours before 4:30.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He trains 2 hours a day, which means he burns 1200kcal extra each day, so he needs to eat at least 400-600kcal extra each day.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No junk food, but focussed on quality.

      "cooked": "<p>Yes, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/robert_ucl\">@Robert_UCL</a> is right and I have left out many details that attribute to the performance gains I have seen. I\u2019ll touch on some of the points mentioned. Which by the way I\u2019m very impressed because it\u2019s almost like you know me with how accurate you were!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>He gets up early, meaning he needs to go to bed 8 hours before 4:30.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically yes. I actually subscribe to the belief that if possible you should wake up naturally without an alarm. From many years of doing this, I\u2019ve noticed I average about 7-7.5 hours of sleep per night, sometimes slightly more if needed. I\u2019m ASLEEP around 9 pm. So in bed a little earlier.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>He trains 2 hours a day, which means he burns 1200kcal extra each day, so he needs to eat at least 400-600kcal extra each day.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I eat like crazy. I weigh nearly 87kg and with my FTP, even my Z2 workouts require lots of calories. My family thinks I\u2019m a bottomless pit.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>No junk food, but focussed on quality. He is probably prepping home meals to take to his job.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So even though admitting in my prior point about eating a lot, Robert is right once again, I am very strict on what I eat. I allow myself to eat whenever I am hungry (which is a lot), but no high fat or sugary treats. Obviously some exceptions to this, such as after a particularly hard workout or special occasions with the family. I also eat basically the same meals for breakfast and lunch every day. Once again I\u2019m probably unusual in that I really don\u2019t get tired of it. We do vary dinner each night though otherwise my family would probably kick me out <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> . Even for dinner though, I have a rule of having vegetable be at least half of my plate. In addition we rarely eat red meat that is higher in fat, we eat mosly lean proteins such as chicken, turkey, and certain cuts of pork. I can get into more detail about diet if someone desires.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll add one more detail I think is quite important, and that is my training/athletic history. I did not start cycling 2 years ago out of the blue without any prior fitness. I played team sports such as American football, basketball, and track and field all my youth. When I attended University, I got very involved with powerlifting and bodybuilding (partly why I\u2019m a bit heavy). I then had a bad injury to my shoulder, so decided to challenge myself and start running when I couldn\u2019t lift. I ended up training for and running several half marathons and full marathons. So my point is, I\u2019ve had a long history of incredibly consistent training in both aerobic and strength.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Thats hard to believe that someone would double their FTP in a couple of years.<br>\nI am in the same boat, endurance athlete all my life and picked up cycling about 10 years ago. Just riding hard, slow, group rides etc. Last year I decided to take the FTP test and give TD a go for few months. Started with 248ftp (3.3W/kg) and after 4 months, when I stopped for the summer to just ride again and have fun, got to 268ftp (3.6W/kg) which from what I read, especially by posts like yours, is nothing.<br>\nI followed coach Jack plan to a T. Finished every single interval, every single day (even those 3h in the saddle Sat / Sun rides). Finished with I think 12h weeks and only saw that 20W increase.<br>\nSo i would love to know what myself, and others like myself, are doing wrong. I was fully expecting that with dedication, time and knowledge base from the app, I could hit 300W. Nope. Not even close.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>I am trying to just say, what I see in this conversation.  He went from basically using a bike as periodic recreation to training.  So this has some similarity to a beginner starting at 100w and going to 200w in 2 years which is completely believable.  It\u2019s just he was already a serious athlete capable of 400w which is the minority.  So at \u201cday 1\u201d he was 200w where most beginners would be more like 50-100w.</p>\n<p>And <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/tayno_25\">@Tayno_25</a> it sounds like from Aug 2023 to Oct 2024 you gained like 9%?</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/soulo_ridah\">@soulo_ridah</a> your case is more typical in that you were probably much deeper into cycling by the time you did your first FTP test so started at a higher level relative to your potential.  Not saying you are at your potential, just saying you won\u2019t gain as quick as a \u201cbeginner\u201d at this point.  Two year cyclist vs 10 year cyclist.</p>",
