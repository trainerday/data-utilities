      "cooked": "<p>Set an event date in CJ for like 6 months from now and CJ will give you a decent plan.  Generally even if you don\u2019t CJ should suggest base.</p>\n<p>To be honest if you are riding outdoors I would not use TrainerDay or a training plan and just ride as much as possible as easy as possible (starting at like 2-3 hours a week and increasing 10% per week and having some rest weeks (reduce total weekly hours) as you need them every 3/4 weeks).  Do this for 3-4 months or more.  Then start a training plan.</p>\n<p>If you are doing this all indoors then a CJ training plan starting now makes more sense.</p>\n<p>To give you an example, I am just returning to more \u201cserious\u201d cycling after years of being too busy with this startup and small twin boys\u2026 My strategy is &lt; 60% of max HR 7 days a week.  One day a week or maybe 2 I allow it to go above this.   So this means I am doing hard core base plan.  I am more of an expert at understanding my body and recovery so I can get away with 7 days a week.  3-4 days a week is more recommended but if you are very careful with intensity you can do more.</p>\n<p>The main starting goal is three things</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improve your bodies ability to handle training stress (I call this increase work capacity)</li>\n<li>Prepare your muscles, joints, tendons for these specific movements.  Muscles increase much faster so it\u2019s risky for tendons and ligaments for example</li>\n<li>Find your weaknesses and improve your positioning on the bike.  I am adding kettlebell swings to safe guard my back for example</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So if you like the idea of a training plan CJ 6-month plan will get you in solid shape in 6 months from now.  I personally am going to do as long of outdoor base period as possible.</p>\n<p>Hope that helps. Ask as many questions as you want.  <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/robert_ucl\">@Robert_UCL</a> Can provide additional ideas.</p>",
