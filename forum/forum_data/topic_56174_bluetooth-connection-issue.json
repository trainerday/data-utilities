I know the Polar was working as the Wahoo Headwind was working no issue.<br>\nThe app was showing 2 devices connected but only one listed like it had lost the Polar.</p>\n<p>Anyway, finished the session and then quit out of the app, re-opened it and went again to Add Device and it was there listed.</p>\n<p>Not sure whats going on as the phone (iPhone SE) could see and connect to the polar from the bluetooth menu outside of Trainer Day but it never appeared in the app even then. Only closing and re-opening cured it.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts?<br>\nRunning the below:</p>\n<p>Apple iPhone SE<br>\nTrainerday App version 5.1.9<br>\niOS vers. 18.3.1</p>\n<p>Cheers<br>\nJames</p>",
