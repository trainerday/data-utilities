I am getting closer to my 6x decade on this planet, picked up biking several years ago and go to about 40-50 percentile in capabilities for may age group\u2026 Maybe I can get a bit more - and that is why I need some training structure.</p>\n<p>For quite sometime already I am, looking for a tool, which would let me do structured training, but then allow me to do my own riding 1-2 days a week and keep workout plan adjusted to accommodate the load from free rides - if more/less needed of particular workout types\u2026 So far I couldn\u2019t find anything. I haven\u2019t tried TrainerRoad (and don\u2019t really want to), Xert can do this in theory, but it is not that good in practice (but their new \u201cmagic buckets\u201d might be a step in right direction).</p>\n<p>I would love TrainerDay to improve CJ to work in load incurred in free rides, but there is another way - maybe some workouts can be just replaced with specific Zwift rides - for example, I can do long endurance ride with an appropriate robopacer or do VO2max while climbing AdZ.</p>\n<p>So I was very interested when I saw this while checking CJ recently:<br>\n<img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6d4b490b327513e5e9bf89cd44d273941e9a17d9.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"fARldZcwzZgNkSEE2hj4DZFl1bz\" width=\"484\" height=\"162\"></p>\n<p>My excitement was short lived though <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The frame to read CJ plan descriptions is too small - hard to read while scrolling - there is a lot of useful information</li>\n<li>Would be really great if all these descriptions can be published as a web page/pdf/epub - I had to go extra mile, copy them all together and create the doc for myself\u2026</li>\n<li>This specific paragraph is out of place - I believe it belongs to the <code>The Serious Italian</code> section - and if all of these would have been published together, such error can be quickly recognized - <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/alex\">@Alex</a> you may want to correct this\u2026</li>\n<li>And the last one - there is no guidance on how to augment <code>The Serious Italian</code> plan with out of plan riding - it would be great if some guidance can be published on this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I guess, my question is - are there any guidelines available for the last item above?</p>\n<p>Would it be a good idea to map different workout types to different type of free rides in a table, then ride and keep a tab on the load/rest/recovery via intervals.icu (which I love as well and wish it would get some training recommendation engine <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> ).</p>\n<p>Any advice would be appreciated!</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Thanks, we recently did some translation and changed things here, it\u2019s possible that caused issues\u2026 But we will look at this.</p>\n<p>To answer your question.  All of our blocks are on the premise of 3 key workouts, in the beginning these are not too hard, if you start at the lower intestines so you have more flexibility in what you add.  In these 3 key workouts their is a main focus.  The SFR intervals, threshold intervals and long ride.  So basically the is a lot of flexibility, meaning you can combine any secondary work you want to this.  Overall I would try to keep that mostly as lower stress activities.  Z2/Z3\u2026 but a little intensity is not so bad either\u2026   Focus on keeping your volume progressions in check meaning don\u2019t start the season at 15 hours a week and end it at 5 hours a week\u2026 Get some rest weeks.</p>\n<p>As you get the harder phases of the block then be more careful not to do stuff that affects the quality of your recovery or the quality of the workouts.  That\u2019s personal.</p>\n<p>So there is no black and white answers as to what is good and what is bad\u2026 Usually riding more is good as long as you can recover from it (good sleep) and not doing way too much for too long.</p>\n<p>Not sure if that helped\u2026  I kind of would say just use common sense following common training advice.

It just means if Intervals TSB (or whatever it is called there)\u2026 is severely negative pay close attention.</p>\n<p>So many variables like sleep, outside stress and diet can severely affect how you recover.  HRV can pick up on some of this but it\u2019s not perfect in most cases either.

Last week I slept 9 hours a night 5 days a row according to Garmin (Garmin\u2019s a bit of a liar but sounds good anyway\u2026).  I still felt very rested and it helped me recover faster from some of my latest increased training stress.

One of the main benefits would be if somebody starts a plan and just hates it you could ask them you know you could make a major adjustment to intensity or you know collect some feedback but nuance day-to-day stuff especially in the coach Jack type of model just doesn\u2019t make sense. I do know that if I was talking to a coach and describing something on a daily basis, I could give them good information but at the end of a ride and a question I\u2019m just gonna click quickly.

I had my 9-day trial run up just now, I didn\u2019t really use it, but selected a plan and was adding other workouts I was doing (currently finishing up a month testing Xert).<br>\nIt seems that Join looks at the TSS/training load, not just RPE. From what I read, that RPE question doesn\u2019t mean much - there is an algorithm, which monitors any training you do an modifies your plan on the fly. Same thing as TrainerRoad and Xert are doing to some extent, but without providing any detailed analysis to the user.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, another issue I find is that most of the training plans start with relatively easy weeks, targeting people, who didn\u2019t train much.<br>\nYour CJ can adjust the starting level, although I am not sure how good it works, but I plan test things out starting early next month <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Yeah I am not speaking of join specific problems, I am just talking about the problem of user feedback and adjusting the plan.  I fully agree for example monitoring TSS but not automatically adjusting but asking the user questions when AI notices something.  Hey it looks like you did a lot this last week, you might want to take it easy for a few days \u201cOk?\u201d  Meaning the relationship of negative TSB (too much TSS too quickly) is very fluid and has a lot of \u201cin depends\u201d so you need to triangulate a bunch of things before making changes to the plan.</p>\n<p>The importance of dynamics also is highly dependent on the nature of how you design plans.  For example if you are xert or TR and you are really pushing people to the limit, well if you are killing them and they tell you, \u201cHey you are killing me.\u201d Then sure AI should reduce the intensity or the volume.  We don\u2019t believe in this approach to training.  So like in Coach Jack if you gradually increase from easy to hard, as long as people don\u2019t take long periods off, it will be fine in 95% of the cases.  The main problem is many people just feel Coach Jack is just too easy in the beginning.  Or they crank it up until it is hard and then they don\u2019t adapt fast enough and need to back off\u2026</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just like going to the gym. If you previously were strong, and you come back after a break if you don\u2019t take it easy then you feel the pain\u2026 So you learn to take it easy at first.  People don\u2019t see it so clearly with bike / endurance training but it works the same way\u2026 It should feel easy at first and slowly progress.  It\u2019s safer and produces better results long term.  This is obviously our opinion and you as the cyclist need to chose what you want to believe and following your own beliefs.  There are 1,000 different opinions out there and merit in many of them.  Most people have to learn to curb their enthusiasm for SUSTAINED seasonal intensity the hard way (via suffering and failure)\u2026</p>",

It should be a guidance - here is the plan, here are suggested workouts, you can do your own rides and our system will give you corrective advice\u2026</p>\n<p>Another issue is picking up or changing plan (or app) in the middle of training. Say, you are doing your own training, somewhere in the middle of the next 6 week phase and want to switch to TrainerDay - if you just pick up a regular plan, it will be very easy, so the challenge is how to equalize the load to avoid steep change? Again, Xert tries to do so by analyzing your training history on Strava, but that can easily lead to immediate overtraining if math picks up wrong ramp rate\u2026 And let me runt about Xert a bit more\u2026</p>\n<p>Looks like Xert is too focused on the math, not physiology of training.<br>\nYou can <strong>not</strong> apply the same exact formula to every person in the world. In order to advise on training load volume or rest, physiological measures have to be taken into account. I think, system like this should look at a combination of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Obviously - the training plan</li>\n<li>Age and training background - both long term and recent</li>\n<li>Training load and rest over moving ~7-14 day window</li>\n<li>Sleep, resting HR, HRV\u2026</li>\n<li>HR behavior over last several training sessions and how it changes compared to previous similar loads</li>\n<li>Feedback - RPE and fatigue</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Polar and Garmin are trying to get this covered to some degree, and I think Polar can manage running training program based on this data, but unfortunately, they are not interested in cycling.</p>\n<p>Interesting that Xert/TR are so focused on suffering during workouts\u2026 Not sure about TR, but going through the weeks of Xert, I see that it is trying to over-train me. Why prescribe intense VO2 max workouts two or more days in a row? Why call \u201cPure Endurance\u201d workout which is essentially Z3/Tempo? I setup Xert to just maintain my fitness, I know that I can do it with certain volume of rides since I been doing this for a while already, but Xert really wants to constantly increase load and hours - much more than I used to do for the last year\u2026 Their AI overestimates FTP, making their intense workouts even harder. And that\u2019s not just my observation - I see similar complains in their forum all the time and the answer often is that user doesn\u2019t understand how to use Xert\ud83d\ude12</p>\n<p>Their training workouts are often based on multiple repeats of micro intervals 180-40% or 120-80% for 30/30 and shorter variations - I guess, this works for some aspects of training, but should this be the primary workout type? Besides VO2 max, Xert is also pushing a lot of Sweet Spot workouts - it is possible to configure advice to your liking, but you may die on that hill while doing so <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/rofl.png?v=12\" title=\":rofl:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":rofl:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t want to make this post a complain about Xert - I like many of their ideas, but implementation might be problematic. If I play with settings, I can lower the load and increase recovery times, but these settings are not always documented well and may require an advanced knowledge on the way system operates. One example - why don\u2019t they automatically shift recovery demand for a program based on age? You can\u2019t really think that 25 and 60 year old athletes need same exact recovery time!<br>\nAnd - if someone learns and becomes proficient in Xert, I bet they can coach themselves without any need for their AI <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=12\" title=\":grinning:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":grinning:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>Anyway - I strongly believe that TrainerDay has a potential to get this kind of approach done well. I been (occasionally) using TD and monitoring/reading forums and changes. When I first tried TD more than two years ago, I was asking you to implement HR based workouts - and they are here and working well now.<br>\nSo - how about getting some \u201cdynamic\u201d training advice system? <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=12\" title=\":grinning:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":grinning:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",

I know many long term TR users that don\u2019t follow their plans or advice for example but just stay for convenience, one is a really good friend and key forum moderator at TR <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">    TR is a very solid product.</p>\n<p>There is a ton of great sounding, un-validated scientific theory.  TSS optimization for best performance is the most clear version of this and most platforms have invested too much in this thinking.  Again, any of these can work well for the right person at the right time and some it can work for long term.  So I am not trying to say it is all wrong, just based on the wrong premise. Xert has the same underlying problems but many people make it work for them.  I like the ideas behind Xert but again it requires more investment or additional creativity/thought then they have been able to invest.</p>\n<p>Regarding someone dropping in mid-stream plan/block, I would love to tackle this problem.  I need someone like you passionate about it to help me <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">   If I put my coach hat on I can solve this problem on a 1:1 basis but when I think about the amount of code required, the number of questions a person would have to answer and all the decision trees and thought behind all the variants it gets scary.  It seems like something an LLM could handle but who really wants to put all their faith in an LLM for their training, or let\u2019s say who should?  With enough fine tuning and constraints it\u2019s likely possible.  It would be easy or at least much easier to \u201cfake it\u201d and make people believe it is a good idea with more un-validated science\u2026  I am not a believer that load = load\u2026 from a physiology stand point, so while that is one of the variables there is just a lot</p>",

But do you reallyt need it? Why not to use some tried and true machine learning techniques and analyze training data for the last month - either uploaded or pulled from Strava. Since you have your own workouts CJ uses to build plans - maybe you can create some kind of training load \u201csignature\u201d for them and see if you can find similar work in historical data. This will allow your app to decide at what level new user was training and ask what way he wants to go - maybe he\u2019ll be fine with lower load to start, giving some time to recover from previous plan or user might choose to start in the middle - if new plan is more or less compatible with what was done previously.</p>\n<p>You are right - one training load may not be the same as another even if TSS matches. You can\u2019t compare long endurance ride with much shorter VO2 max or that to HIIT! That\u2019s where the pattern recognition is needed - how the distribution of power over time compares between workouts and rides?<br>\nI think, if this can be solved, it would be a great start to analyze training more efficiently, including ability to manage weekly mix of workouts and free rides.</p>",

I am always looking for optimum ideas that could pull this forward.</p>\n<p>So TrainerRoad used machine learning in their solution but think about this.  What does ML give you?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Marketing to say your have an AI solution</li>\n<li>Either a lot of things we already know or hypothesis on new things that need to be tested/validated.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember if you tell ML that you eat ice cream every and your FTP went up by 30% in 6 months, it\u2019s going to say you need to eat more ice cream.</p>\n<p>The reason I say all this is because the data that we have in fitness is rather low quality and very sparse compared to everything going on.  Very few people have very high quality diet, sleep, hrv and testing protocols in their data to know what is going on.  So if you put bad or extremely limited data in you are not going to get much value out.  Ride more get faster, sleep more and recover better get faster, don\u2019t injure yourself or get sick\u2026</p>\n<p>I am a strong believer that LLM\u2019s are a huge amount of hype.</p>\n<p>As much as people believe a system should be able to match training to their physiology it\u2019s not very true unless you can have deep conversations to understand the human as much as possible.  What people really want is something to match their expectations not their physiology because if it does not match their expectations or beliefs they won\u2019t follow it anyway\u2026  This is where humans coaches and humans in general come in, they can build trust, so when they say, start out easy, even though you really want to start hard, you might give it a chance\u2026 So LLMs have the potential for reasonable quality conversation and collecting the data that could get a better match or even convince the person why something is right for them.</p>\n<p>Again this is not easy, just sharing my thoughts.  I am looking for a break though idea as I am stuck in my own head on this stuff\u2026  There is some basic simple stuff we could do that would add value and improve the matching process and make it more dynamic.  We started something like this, but even that got complicated fast.  I would say most \u201cAI\u201d systems now are just using random math ideas to generate plausible ideas that don\u2019t match human physiology\u2026   That does not fit my interest or what I feel is in the best interest of our cyclists even if I could make a compelling story around it.</p>",

The base plans are typically going to start with over/unders and sweet spot adding VO2 type intervals before base is even over.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s my experience with Xert as well - Their endurance is actually Tempo and it has no issue giving two VO2 max or HIIT workouts in a row. I can sustain it, but after 3 weeks I have to ask myself - do I have to or do I even want to? I am able to keep my training level and improve slowly just riding on my own in Zwift and outside. I have no issue pushing myself - when I feel that I can sustain good load. Or take it easy and enjoy the ride when I need a break and I monitor my fitness via Intervals.icu. But now I want to do a good long route in Zwift with some climbs and after Xert been pushing me every day - I feel that I am not recovering enough next day to take the load I want.</p>\n<p>Thank you for the feedback, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/dthrog00\">@dthrog00</a>, very useful!</p>",

You need to understand what signals correlate first before applying ML to them. If you have a training load signature of a good set of workouts, trying to find same patterns in other workouts and free rides can produce valuable information. But this is very specific use case, applicable to structured workouts and rides with power recorded. You may be able to add HR to that, but this will vary more.</p>\n<p>Other signals - diet, HRV, sleep - yes, these are much lower quality and often just missing at all.</p>\n<p>LLMs in general - yes, hype. But pattern matching in specific datasets is doable. Not sure if it would be easy to train LLM, but use some trending/Fourier analysis - may work.</p>",
