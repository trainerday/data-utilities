I would argue with a small amount of additional work,  you could follow plans that are likely to be slightly easier in overall effort and yet more effective.  The details matter and each individual is unique so there is no such thing as one size fits all.</p>\n<p>All in all, I am see the benefits in SS based plans for the right individuals.  Love to hear other peoples thoughts on additional benefits or negatives of SS based plans.</p>\n<p><strong>I am not saying their is anything wrong with sweet-spot workouts!!!</strong>  They are essentially a threshold workout, and when used correctly within a plan have tons of evidence to back up their validity.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>I\u2019ve been back and forth on the sweet-spot debate, but as of now I stand on the side of: yes sweet-spot <em>can</em> be good IF your FTP isn\u2019t set too high, AND you\u2019re using it as a supplement to lack of training time (not as a full out training plan) or for specific adaptations you are looking for AND the intervals are long enough (imo most SweetSpot workouts are too short). So it has a place, but often it is used too much\u2026</p>\n<p>First problem is if you have an FTP set too high (ramp test puts you at 75% of MAP but maybe you are 72% of MAP\u2026 or perhaps 20min test puts you at 95% but your FTP is 93%), then these will be less like sweet-spot and more like lower-end threshold workouts. This becomes a problem with the fatigue you are introducing. The goal of SweetSpot, in my opinion should be to increase the adaptations but without compromising recovery (too much).</p>\n<p>Second point is that I\u2019m not a big fan of a full-out SweetSpot plan. The better coaches I know include SweetSpot in the case that riders need the progressive overload but simply don\u2019t have the time to get it.<br>\nA basic example would be if last time I was training at 500 TSS per week of zone2 (say, 10hrs per week \u2013 numbers just for sake of example), then by principles of progressive overload, I would need more work to continue to adapt. But if I still only have 10 hours per week, there\u2019s only so much zone2 I can do to get what I need. Therefore adding in 1 SweetSpot workout might be what\u2019s needed to continue the overload. With that being said athletes need to be very individualized and some might not need a sweetspot interval until they are nearing the upper range of their fitness with their given amount of time available. Other athletes might need 2-3+ SweetSpot workouts per week with their given time and fitness. But just throwing someone into a SS based plan is probably not the best idea, in my opinion <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>Last point is that most SS intervals are too short to get the adaptations that people are looking for. I look at some training plans and see SS intervals in the range of 10-20 minutes \u2013 the same as a threshold workout. I personally think these are just too short, but the reason they might work for people is because of point 1 \u2013 their FTP is too high, so they are actually getting in threshold workouts and accumulating more fatigue than they are ready for\u2026 Anyhow, this is mostly anecdotal, but I see myself and athletes I work with build a really strong \u201cbase\u201d when SS is used sparingly, and when it is used, it comes in a long steady progression, much longer than a few 15min intervals\u2026 One of my athletes is in the middle of a progression where he does 3 x 30min SS. Next week he\u2019ll do 2 x 45min and will follow up with a 1 x 90min. I\u2019ve had some go past 1x120min SS. Progressing time before power is key, but there are many ways to build an island. (is that the saying?) This is just what I\u2019ve seen</p>",

On the 3rd week is a workout Eclipse, 90 minutes with 3x20 minutes SS intervals. Which Jeremy suggest as a starting point for SS training.</p>\n<p>Even if I have succeed the previous workouts in the plan, which should prepare me for this 3*20 SS workout, I failed, and managed to only do half of the last interval.</p>\n<p>Maybe my FTP is set to high (I will test again), or the plan is not for me and I need more of base-base workouts.</p>\n<p>So I think starting with 3x20min SS, maybe is not right solution for everybody. And even not TrainerRoads base low volume SS plan.</p>",

I think Jeremy is talking about a racer in his 20s or 30s starting point and missing the bigger picture of the non-racers, beginners, older riders and others that would need to slowly build to these loads.</p>\n<p>My pro-coach friend has been coaching for 30-years and recommends a much lower starting point.  He focuses on threshold based rides but he suggest a starting point of</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5m <span class=\"mention\">@100</span>% + 2m rest</li>\n<li>4m@100% + 2m rest</li>\n<li>3m@100% \u2026 rest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like this<br>\n</p><aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <a href=\"https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/threshold-block-starter-33m\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">app.trainerday.com</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img src=\"\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"\" height=\"\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/threshold-block-starter-33m\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trainer Day</a></h3>\n\n\n\n  </article>\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>See how that goes\u2026 slowly build from there.  You can extend those intervals a little if you want to do a SS focus.  If this is way too easy for you then bump it up in the beginning but still do small increases, like 10% interval length increases a week.</p>\n<p>I believe TR plans are designed for 25 year old racers.  This is the reason I created TrainerDay to help educate people they must self-coach and find what works for them.  If TR works for someone one, great.  Even though lots of people on their forums talk about how great TR plans are, I believe that this is a minority of riders.  Get 1,000 of their 100,000 users saying it is great and it sounds like they are the most amazing plans ever.  I think TR is a great platform, I think the guys there are great, I just believe those plans are great for a specific demographic of rider.  I think their singular focus is actually not a bad thing it\u2019s just the rest of us need something else.</p>",
