      "cooked": "<p>Thanks for the reply Alex.  My goal is not very focused but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as bad as it sounds.  I had been doing Long Course triathlons until covid, then stopped the racing and started doing things slightly more recreationally.  Last year I did a few ultras (very slow but also very enjoyable) and also cycled to Switzerland from UK in 6 days to then do the Jungfrau marathon.  It was all quite slow but again enjoyable.  So this year I would like to get back in to the same sort of fitness again - where I can cycle a few 100 milers back to back and also run a marathon.  I am really happy with TD so far and I think I have found some running plans in intervals to fill that gap so fingers crossed <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",

TD has been excellent to boost my cycling fitness and i would like to incorporate running which i am just starting to love all over again. i was searching whether i can train for a cycling race and a half/full marathon but i would always land to a duathlon. i am now following some free running plans from the internet but it would be really nice if coach jack/TD would create one for me that incorporates with cycling. my goal is to have an A race for cycling and running this year. considering a duathlon but i\u2019d like to tackle longer distances for both. make it happen! lol even with a price increase, i\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely worth it.</p>",
