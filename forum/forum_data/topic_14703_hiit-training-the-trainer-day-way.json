      "cooked": "<p>Once a week I\u2019m doing a HIIT training for which I used one of the workouts as a baseline.  I\u2019m a 50+ working cycling enthousiast, enjoying cycling, but with one big goal : an Alpine event this summer.  I\u2019m usually doing my \u201ctough day\u201d on a Wednesday.  As probably a lot of us recognize, one Wednesday is not the other.  For pro racers, a fixed workout makes perfect sense : this is what you have to do (unless you are sick).  For us, working class cyclists, it doesn\u2019t work like that.  Which is where THE top feature of Trainer Day comes in.<br>\nMy point is : I can take a schedule with 3x10 HIIT repeats.  One week it can work, the other \u2026 not really.  Of course you can always stop a session and scroll forward, but I hate doing that.  Or the other way round, sometimes I feel really good and I would like to add another block (I realise pro cyclists are not supposed to do that, they have to follow the exact schedule, but again, I\u2019m just a working guy).<br>\nSo what did I do : I created \u201cHIIT blocks\u201d (<a href=\"https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/sport-it-hiit-block-10\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Trainer Day - Workout: Sport IT HIIT Block 10</a>).  From 10 repeats, over 8-6-4-2.  I start with a workout plan I think I can do.  Or with no plan at all.  Do my warmup and then take a 10 block to start.  After that, I add whatever I think works that day.<br>\nIt\u2019s one of the stunning features of Trainer Day which totally works for me !</p>",

We would love to have the ability to \u201cadd an an interval set work/rest\u201d with 1 click which would even simplify that farther, but I do the same as you so I know it\u2019s not that bad other than in the middle of something hard fiddling around kind sucks.  Really happy, this is working for you though!!!</p>",
