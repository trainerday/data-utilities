      "cooked": "<p>Hi Alex,</p>\n<p>Just a quick note to say the link from that section on your website homepage goes to a 404.</p>\n<p>Also, just to say that I ended up on TrainerDay after finding out about it in intervals.icu.  I\u2019ve signed up for a plan now.  One thing I\u2019ve been struggling with in the past is finding a training plan geared to my needs and how I want to train.  Most of the ones I\u2019ve tried to follow before are not customisable enough or, they are a generic \u201coff the shelf\u201d plan that don\u2019t really take into account when you can train and how long you can train for.  First impressions of using the Coach Jack builder were really good.  Just simple things like being able to set the start date of the plan in the past (given that I\u2019m already in week 2 of a 4 week cycle and don\u2019t want to have to wait another 4 weeks until a recovery week), the ability to customise it so that it reflects that I\u2019m about to switch from base to build, letting it know what days I ride but also what my preferred long-ride day is.</p>\n<p>I feel like I got a plan that I can confidently commit to now.  I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing how it works out for me!</p>\n<p>Nick</p>",
