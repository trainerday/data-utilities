Since I ride indoors way more than outdoors, I usually leave the same bike on the trainer all the time and ride a different bike when I go out to ride. Unlike the kicker, my power meter is auto-calibrating (quark).</p>\n<p>Since I don\u2019t use power smoothing the reported power moves around a lot. In fact, I don\u2019t constantly watch how the workout is going, I just check in from time to time and look at the results at the end. Sometimes the workout seems really easy and I\u2019ll check the app to see what\u2019s going on and the target power will be much higher than the peak reported power.<br>\nIf I stop the workout and do a spin-down for the trainer everything seems to go back to normal.</p>\n<p>Since the app is getting power from the power meter and controlling the trainer why am I still having to do spin-downs? I love the app and think it\u2019s a great value, just wondering.</p>",

As I said it is infrequent and a spin-down calibration in the wahoo app fixes it until the next time it happens. I guess what\u2019s strange to me is that it doesn\u2019t seem to be a gradual shift but more of a one-ride to the next change. It may be something inherent to the trainer if TD is simply inputting target power to the trainer and the trainer responds as it may. I had hoped that maybe the app monitored and adjusted as needed for symmetry. An occasional spin-down is not a big deal. I can notice the problem right away, I just prefer to warm up the trainer before doing it. I guess my power meter is really not making the ride power more accurate than just using the trainer\u2019s reported power but I guess It does let me know if I need to do a spin-down calibration.</p>",

The reported power number also fluctuates quite a bit depending on smoothing. If the workout becomes too hard or too easy over time (workout to workout) I can either adjust with the offset buttons or make a new workout. I\u2019m not a number geek, I just want consistency so I can monitor how I\u2019m progressing, if at all (hey, I\u2019m old, really old). If everything feels as expected during the workout then I mainly look at the average power and heart rate in the ride summary to gauge how I\u2019m doing.</p>\n<p>If the app does adjust the trainer to match the power meter, that\u2019s great but there are occasions when reported power is maybe 20% lower than the target. I feel like a hero until I look at it and see the powerline is well below the target bar and it\u2019s time to do a spin-down calibration.</p>\n<p>Maybe at those times, the trainer is so far off, the app can\u2019t compensate. At any rate, I have no real complaints. My needs are simple, If I could create workouts in Wahoo\u2019s app I would be using that but thankfully this app exists and here I am.</p>",

You also can also click on the HR field or power field (not 100% sure), I can\u2019t remember\u2026 but it will show average interval watts.</p>\n<p>Anyway yes, the way our power match works is it waits about 20 seconds to determine if it needs to make an adjustment to the power to get back on track.  This is the nature of power match to some degree.  Power match is complex so we could reduce this 20 seconds but it\u2019s not easy.</p>\n<p>Glad you are happy <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",
