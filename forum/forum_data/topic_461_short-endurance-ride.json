      "cooked": "<p>So I mention this a lot but it is again relevant here that I have a great friend that is a 30-year world tour coach. I also talk to many other amazing coaches.  The reason for stating this will be more clear later.</p>\n<p>This is a little unrelated but many of us understand the idea that we are burning some ratio of carbs to fat no matter what the intensity, it\u2019s just the ratio changes to more carbs with higher intensities.</p>\n<p>This same concept exists when talking about good stress/damage and non-useful stresss/damage while training.   As we know without some level of stress we would not improve.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s interesting because when you read between the lines or dig deeper with these top level coaches including Dylan and Seiler you see them focused on trying to mininimize this non-useful damage.  Too many hard effort training sessions generates excessive non-useful stress/damage.  Too much bad stress increases your risk for injury and illness not to mention slows your growth (can be a little or might be a lot).</p>\n<p>So these coaches want lots of good stress redueced amounts of bad stress.  When done right, high intensity training still minimizes the non-useful stress compontent.</p>\n<p>Ok that sounds like a side track but actually it goes deeper into your answer.  Training below your ventilatory threshold causes very minimal non-useful stress and provides a healthy amount of good stress. If you want to maximize this relationship it should not just be endurance focused, but below your ventilatory (aerobic) threshold.</p>\n<p>I have an Humon SMO2 device and it is very clear my ventilatory threshold is between 120-125 BPM.  My max HR is 180-182. So this is about 65% of HR max, I think this is fairly typical.  So Dr Seiler\u2019s Zone 1 is up to 65% of HR for me.</p>\n<p>Dr Phil Maffetone has been studying aerobic threshold training and estimations for 20+ years and feels his forumla is accurate for most.  Even though it is age related it seems to be well validated/verified.  You can google his forumla.  Probably just &lt;65% is pretty safe for maximizing this good/bad relationship.</p>\n<p>I also have a deep background in low HR training as well as HRV.  I built an HRV app, 8+ years ago used by the US olympic speed skating team including 1 skater than one 4 gold medals while using my app.  Not bragging just stating I have been invloved with HR based training and recovery monitoring for along time.   If you get really good at HRV testing you can clearly see this good/bad stress relationship.</p>\n<p>So the other reason I mentioned my friend the WT coach is that his belief is that extensive amounts of indoor riding also causes excess physiological damage as compared to the more dynamic nature of outdoor riding. He has one of the top cycling labs in the world and this his deep interest. He suggests most indoor rides should be up to around 60-minutes and really maxing out at 90-minutes indoors.  Also, that for maximizing your training time efficiency, you really only need one long ride per week outdoors and the rest can be these shorter sessions.</p>\n<p>Sorry such a long answer to a simple question <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  Back to the original answer yes 1-hr endurance is great, below 65% HR might be a little better <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",
