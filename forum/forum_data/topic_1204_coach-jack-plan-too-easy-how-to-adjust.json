      "cooked": "<p>I read in another thread that the Coach Jack plan feedback/adjust mechanism isn\u2019t implemented yet (target next winter season).</p>\n<p>After week 1 of my plan, I\u2019m finding the plan too weak for me (possibly due to the way I answered some of the questions - I did say I wanted a Base plan, and that I was recovering from an injury (actually a hip replacement 7 weeks ago, so might not be a good match with your \u201cinjury\u201d implementation)).</p>\n<p>Short of copying the entire plan to my personal plans and adjusting the individual workouts, is there any way to adjust the plans? Or should I scrap the whole plan and start a new Coach Jack plan?</p>\n<p>BTW, I did look at the Edit Plan option, but I couldn\u2019t see the answers to my Coach Jack questions there (none of the Edit options seemed to match the original questions, and they\u2019re not clear how the plan will be changed if I change the two Edit options that are available).</p>\n<p>One option I did consider was to use the % adjust in-app for every workout going forward until the end of the plan, but that seems a bit silly (especially since it totally invalidates the W\u2019bal feature in the app to forecast how strong/weak the workout will be).</p>\n<p>Would it be possible to apply the ERG increase % on the website somehow (maybe one setting for the plan) such that all the workouts going forward are adjusted, and the plan details on the website reflect the % increase. This should allow at least some manual control in the short term, until the workout feedback/adjust mechanism can be built. My expectation is that I could make a change in the ERG increase % on the website, and immediately see the impact on the individual planned workouts and W\u2019bal, and that all upcoming workouts in the app are already pre-adjusted as well (and I could possibly do a further manual adjustment to the ERG increase % in app depending on how I\u2019m feeling at the start of or during my workout).</p>",

I won\u2019t go into a long opinion here but I would do very easy if I were you and learning to do easy is a skill that can make you a much better performance cyclist(maybe you are good at it now).  If you know your body and are ready for more that\u2019s great too. The downsides to doing easy while you recover are small (nothing a month of intensity can\u2019t fix, other than the going crazy part <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> , I suggest Netflix documentaries, and the downside to doing too much is big (prolong your injury).</p>\n<p>Ok back to the question.  Ignorning that advice <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> The easiest thing to do is just start over with a jack plan.  All our plans start pretty easy unless you crank up the intensity slider and even then the base plan is still easy with the slider up but at level 10 it will have higher intensity.  The next best choice is maybe do all zone 2 and 1 day a week of tempo or sweet spot (create a custom plan to do this).</p>\n<p>So yes just create a new plan is the best option and really should only take minutes if you are starting to get the hang of how Jack works.</p>\n<p>Similar to the adjust feature you could just increase your FTP.  And if you are not good at easy, I suggest to practice <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> Best of luck with fast recovery and a nice Jack plan.</p>",

That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m ready to \u2018crank it up to 11\u2019, but I should be good to do a little work on my cardio (staying away from all strength/climb/out of the saddle work for the next few weeks at least). So yes, I am starting slow. Having said that, the 3 Jack workouts that I had last week, two were tempo and didn\u2019t even register on the W\u2019bal (heart rate around 120 and barely sweating), and the third was an anaerobic where the W\u2019bal barely kissed the 100% line at the last rep (and heart rate up to 145, which is usually my endurance target), so I think I have some room to crank things up a couple notches before I need to be concerned about too much too soon.</p>\n<p>Also, I am already pretty good at \u201ceasy\u201d. Even on group rides, I know there\u2019s only so many times I can push my heart rate above 160 before the tank is empty, but I can go many hours at 140-145.</p>\n<p>As per your recommendations, I\u2019ll blow away the current plan and start over with a fresh one, keeping the intensity lowish (but answer no to the injury question). I\u2019ll then use the W\u2019bal tool to confirm that I\u2019ve picked the right settings (I\u2019m hoping to see somewhere near 100% on a tempo workout and maybe 25% on anaerobic sections)</p>\n<p>EDIT: after learning more about how the W\u2019bal works (it is only impacted for work above FTP), I\u2019ve settled on workouts that register for Endurance and only go down to half (the 100% line) for Anaerobic workouts for now. I\u2019ll try that for another week to see how I feel before adding any more.</p>",

Just realize unlike most other platforms our workouts are very logically progressive, not just with regards to TSS but with regards to increasing total duration of hard efforts, so let it start a little easy and then building up slowly your body will build at a similar pace.  If you start too hard then you are less likely complete the plan (16 weeks anyway).  By the end you will see the workouts are much harder than the beginning but should feel acceptably hard.</p>",

I know most pros use 40% and Coach Andrea recommends 40% but for sure part of it is how you determine your FTP.</p>\n<p>If you use a 20-minute test or you have a TT rider power curve with a ramp test your FTP will be lower than a all-rounder or sprinter on a ramp test.  So recovery % can be an individual thing like everything.  I would say most people should get better at recovery but everything is \u201cit depends.\u201d  Platforms or coaches that focus on maximizing CTL or TSS will have a hgher recovery level but this is a bad reason to increase your recover percentage in our opinion.  So it might just take some getting used to.</p>\n<p>I am not apposed to creating a way to increase recovery a bit as I do feel there is some room for increasing it for specific individuals.  How are you doing FTP tests?  And  what does your power curve look like.  Meaning MMP or Power Duration Curve?</p>",
