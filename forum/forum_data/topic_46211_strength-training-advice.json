      "cooked": "<p>Hi Trx,</p>\n<p>Strength training is an essential part of getting better on the bike. The way to do strength training varies. You can do strength training on the bike, weight training or body weight training.</p>\n<p>They all have their benefits and limitations.</p>\n<p>I advise my clients to do basic bike time divided over at least three workouts. During the base period, I plan some strength training on the bike. The advantage is that the time spent on the bike is good. The disadvantage is that only a limited number of muscles will be developed and only to a certain strength.</p>\n<p>Your core muscles, for instance, contribute to your performance but are not really getting any training when you\u2019re on the bike, especially not on a road bike.</p>\n<p>Taking your training to the gym to do some serious weight training is an excellent way to get stronger, provided that it doesn\u2019t compromise your bike time and that you are motivated to do so.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t like going to the gym, but I see the results on the bike, and that keeps me motivated. My advice: if you hate going to the gym, don\u2019t do it. You won\u2019t see the results, but you won\u2019t be bored out, either.</p>\n<p>A simple and very effective way is to do bodyweight training. Using Tabata-style training, you can easily add 2 or 3 extra workouts in your week, and it will only cost you minutes.</p>\n<p>This might sound like it isn\u2019t worth the effort, but believe me, it is the smallest investment with huge returns. Think about it.<br>\nYou don\u2019t waste any time going to the gym, no long training sessions, no equipment needed, litte recovery time.</p>\n<p>I do this kind of training when I roll out of bed on the bedroom floor. Ten minutes later, I\u2019m in the shower, ready to start my day.</p>\n<p>Let me know what kind of training you\u2019re looking for and I\u2019ll give you some more advice.</p>\n<p>Have lots of fun, Coach Robert</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Great. I think there is not much strength training on the bike you can do.  Studies show that this kind of training is very limited in effectiveness.</p>\n<p>On the other side, most intervals will make sure you get stronger on the bike.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples:<br>\n5 minute sweet spot intervals on a two hour training.<br>\n3 minute zone 4 intervals with 3 minutes rest.<br>\nevery zone 5 and zone 6 training.<br>\nEvery hill or mountain climb</p>\n<p>My advice is to do these kind of trainings. Forget about strength training on the bike. These trainings will all make you stronger anyway.</p>\n<p>My clients have three trainings:<br>\n1 zone 5 or 6 training<br>\n1 zone 4 training<br>\n1 zone 2 training</p>\n<p>If they want to train more than three times a week I let them choose the third training. It can be sweet spot, zone 2 or a fartlek training. Meaning you don\u2019t have a schedule but you train as the route gives you your obstacles.</p>\n<p>Any mountain bike route is a fartlek-style training. You go up, down, over rocks, through a creek, etc.</p>\n<p>The freedom of choice is important so you don\u2019t get \u201ccramped\u201d by following a schedule all the time. There are only a few riders that follow a schedule to the end year in, year out.</p>\n<p>Do you make your weight training seasonal? I mean do you adapt your weight training the different stages in your season and/ or schedule?</p>\n<p>With weights, you can follow a base, build, and peak routine too.</p>",

Unfortunately also the fault of the English language of the descriptions I wanted a piece of advice on which blocks to use type Among those proposed on the site type the serius italian,crunched power  ecc ecc .Or better still use the custom block and insert the most suitable exercises for strength during this period.<br>\nI repeat the translator is not on my side so excuse me for the mistakes.</p>",

When it comes to anaerobic work capacity it\u2019s difficult to make a huge change in this other than 8-12 weeks of hard efforts and you reach your peak. The best thing you can do is raise your aerobic capacity so you don\u2019t have to push so hard.  Raise your base and then your anaerobic power above that is raised as well.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Alex makes a good point: Look at what you need in your marathon and your strengths as a cyclist.</p>\n<p>Mountainbike Marathons are the ultimate nightmare. They are long, so you need endurance, but they also have many steep, technical climbs that require skill and strength.</p>\n<p>The rule of training is simple: use it or lose it. This means that a block of strength training from November until January will give you great power in February, but that power will fade away during the season.</p>\n<p>Since you have time to do weight training, I would extend that period.</p>\n<p>Start with 5-second reps. Do all your exercises after each other. Pik a weight you can use to do 8-10 reps. Do 5 seconds up, 5 seconds down. As may reps as you can, but no more than 10. If you can do more, pick a heavier weight. After one set, go to the next exercise. Do one round, maybe a second if you can. Do this for 6 weeks. Ideally, you would follow your Trainer Day schedule of 3 weeks of work and 1 week of rest. No weight training during rest week.</p>\n<p>For the next 6 weeks, you make exploding reps up and three reps down. do 3 sets of each exercise and pick a weight you can do 12-15 reps with. Again, follow your rest routine from your Trainer Day schedule.</p>\n<p>For the rest of the season, do 4 or 5 sets of 25 to 35 reps per exercise. Pick different exercise every 6 weeks. And don\u2019t forget to take weeks of, as in your Trainer Day schedule.</p>\n<p>Again, weight training gives you way better results for strength than bike training. You will develop all the muscles in your body, fatigue less, and develop stamina and power.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry about your bike training. Do what you did last year. Do the intervals and a heap of zone 2, and you will have a great season.</p>",

If you don\u2019t like it, it will be a burdon and it won\u2019t last.

You focus on 8 reps with heavy weights. One round 5 sec up and down per movement.</li>\n<li>Build. Focus on 3 sets of 10-12 reps.</li>\n<li>Peak.

      "cooked": "<p>Following up on the strength training topic.  I\u2019ve just subscribed to TD and set up a Coach Jack training plan for 4 days a week, starting at 5 hours a week.  I have generally been working out 6 or even 7 days a week in the past, with a mix of cardio (majority bike, but some running and rucking mixed in at times) and strength training. I\u2019d like to continue to do at least 2 strength training sessions a week with the Coach Jack plan. Should I drop those into 2 of the three rest days, or it better to take a true rest day and do the strength training on the same day I bike (before or after biking)? I am retired now so have plenty of time to double up on workouts, I just worry that I would overdo it by doubling up.  I actually feel better when I work out, so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been working out 6-7 days a week, so would go the approach of 4 days bike, 2 days resistance, and maybe the remaining day of some stretching/yoga unless I need multiple true rest days.  Thanks!</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi CDPHou,</p>\n<p>That is a nice schedule you have there. I wouldn\u2019t advise to do double days.</p>\n<p>The first reason for this is that you make that day only about training. Your cardio and strenght training should be four hours apart from each other to get the benefit out of both. In between you want to rest and eat, so there is not muh left of your day.</p>\n<p>Second is that double days are really good if you are already packed in your training schedule and you have a full team to support you in your recovery. This means you are a pro or try to live like one.</p>\n<p>Finally the double days will take so much recovery time that the risk of overtraining is big and, it gets bigger the older you get.</p>\n<p>So, just do it like you\u2019ve done it before. Train six days a week and take one dedicated rest day with some yoga or stretching if you want to.</p>\n<p>It a great way of getting old the healthy way and show that of to all the young dogs who think they can beat you easily. <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=12\" title=\":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>Have fun, Coach Robert</p>",

I am coming back from a long break (Oct. 2022\u2026July 2024) due to accident-related injury. For the second half of 2024 I did mostly free rides and SST-type training, some low-cadence \u201cstrength-endurance\u201d, plus a little bit of VO2max. Now I want to use TD/Coach Jack to prepare myself for a set of (European/4+ h) Gravel races, with the first ones in May and early June.</p>\n<p>However, I still do a significant amount of work in the gym, mostly strength training for legs and core (variants of squats, lunges, stepdowns, etc.). Currently I do three sessions a week and I foresee to keep this at 2/w for, at least, most part of the year. This strength training is planned and overlooked by the medical athletics center of the local hospital. Thus, I do not need actual input for the strength training.</p>\n<p>What I am looking for is the appropriate way to have Coach Jack take this information into account. After all, these are sessions with quite high (muscular) intensity.<br>\nI would assume that in first instance I should be able to infuse the past sessions into the activity list \u2013 they are on Strava, but TD does not download them.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, for now I simply told Coach Jack not to put (cycling) workouts on these days, but obviously I now have days that look like rest days but are in fact high-intensity days.<br>\nAfter all, it does make a difference to do HIIT following \u201clong ride\u201d, \u201chigh intesity (gym)\u201d vs. \u201clong ride\u201d, \u201crest\u201d \u2026</p>\n<p>Thus, I assume I should inform Coach Jack of the use of the locked days, wether it is a rest day or a high-intensity gym day\u2026 how to do this in the best possible way?</p>",

It\u2019s not so much worse for me regarding the actual strength training itself, the main real drawback is that it is pretty bad for double days when you do the strength training after the on-bike workout:-o</p>\n<p>I do measure HRV (well, using the Apple Watch) already for years using a 5 min measurement in the morning. Unfortunately, it much more reflects my load/stress at work than exercise stress. Even after very hard workouts\u2026</p>\n<p>Yes, in principle I can drag workouts around manually, but as my schedule \u2013 also as given to Coach Jack \u2013 is such that the training blocks are very different, for me it is not a \u201cmove around\u201d but a replan/find new workouts\u2026 Then, however, I could directly set up my training manually\u2026 which I am trying to avoid;-)</p>\n<p>Right now, in fact, I have this:<br>\nTuesday, Thursday, Saturday: strength work in gym<br>\nCoach Jack: Monday: 60 min; Wednesday 90 min; Friday 180 min; Sunday: automatic, long-ride day</p>\n<p>Yes, I will have to introduce a rest day, which will be the Monday.  At that time I will likely switch to only-2-times/week strength training.<br>\nCurrently, in base training, the 60 min on Monday are effectively \u201crecovery\u201d even when it is formally 60 min Z2\u2026</p>\n<p>Will have to see how to set up strength training. If I have to do it manually, maybe Tuesday and Saturday strength, Wednesday 90 min cycling, Thursday &amp; Friday longer cycling \u2013 here I see the potential problem \u2013 while the long ride on Sunday after the Saturday gym looks like it will produce decent good overload before the real rest day;-)</p>\n<p>But this would really mean that the intensity-hard cycling workout should be on Thursday, not?<br>\nOr can Coach Jack tell me (better)?</p>",
