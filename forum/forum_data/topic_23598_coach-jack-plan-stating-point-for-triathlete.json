Each athlete has a limited period of time they can sustain intensity usually 4-6 months depending on many factors.</p>\n<p>Most riders coming off of TrainerRoad are closer to the end of that period.  Many get fast gains on TR but if they don\u2019t properly inject quality periodization can get \u201cstuck,\u201d grinding intensity without progress and in worst case burning out.</p>\n<p>In general it\u2019s safer for us to \u201crestart\u201d periodization from the beginning at some level.  Even though in the short term you risk going a little backwards, the long term is this will establish better training patterns that lead to more predictable, repeatable, seasonal improvements. Not saying we are going to be better than TR for all athletes, I am just saying we take a more extreme view on periodization.  We wouldn\u2019t recommend \u201csweet spot base\u201d for example. Not saying it can\u2019t work, it\u2019s just too risky for long term progress.</p>\n<p>Jack can be tweaked to match your exact needs but requires some additional discussion.  You are more than welcome to specify your goals, time line, a bit of history, age, health, favorite type of training and intensity\u2026 and I can make suggestions on how to change the settings.</p>",

I actually haven\u2019t followed a TrainerRoad plan in a while. As a triathlete, they have too much intensity for me. I generally do 3 bikes, 3 runs, 3 swims, and 2 strength sessions a week. With TrainerRoad, almost all were prescribed as moderate-to-hard. I have had experience with MAF/low intensity training in the past. I actually won my age group without doing any running intensity for 2-3 months leading into that race and set a PR in a 70.3 without really ever going over LT1 in training (except for swimming).</p>\n<p>I am trying to figure out how TrainerDay handles progression in training plans when I have maxed my time available (1 hr Mon, 1 hr Wed, and 2 hrs Sat). I have been playing around with different Coach Jack options. Looking forward to trying them out this winter.</p>",

While I don\u2019t think strict TSS management makes sense obviously you can\u2019t ramp up too quickly with your workload.
