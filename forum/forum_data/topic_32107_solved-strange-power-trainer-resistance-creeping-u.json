      "cooked": "<p>Hello guys, happy to be here.</p>\n<p>My name is Constantin, and I started (actually heard about) trainer day - in december, when I signed up. I am (was) also a trainer road user - and I come from there. I don\u2019t use zwift (I prefer other types of entertainment while I pedal).</p>\n<p>I like this app, ofc because of the GREAT VALUE for what we get, but I also abused it in the last month and almost was sold to it an nothing else. Unfortunately got a problem \u2026</p>\n<p>Strange thing happened today. Trying to detail below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Started the App like every day,  picked a workout - the starting power was 69 watts - but the output (the number on the right) was 140  - then keep increasing every second or so - 141 \u2026 142 \u2026 143 \u2026 144 \u2026 and so on until I couldn\u2019t keep up.</li>\n<li>Tried to stop the workout, picked another - same problem, the power needed to keep the pedals turning was slowly creeping up - but in the left (required power) - was a stable \u2026 60 or something low</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Did basic troubleshooting. RESTARTED the phone (not only the app by \"quitting it - on IOS sliding the app up). Restarted the trainer (it\u2019s plugged in). Started the app again - picked a workout - same issue.</p>\n<p>This happened BEFORE - in 16 january - I did <a href=\"https://app.trainerday.com/activities/65a6dec45223cb27f5f12b66\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">NiceMix 60 mins </a>  - and at minute 40 or so - same thing happened. That was NOT a sprint - it was me trying to keep up with the \u201ccreeping up power\u201d . The \u201crequired\u201d power came back to normal after the first \u201cinterval change\u201d. So if it was required to have 100W - and was creeping up to 180 - when the app required 90W (something different) - the thing stabilized again and went smooth.  I repeat - the required power \u201cfield\u201d states the correct number (say \u2026 100W) but you need 180 W to keep the pedals turning and creeps up \u2026</p>\n<p>I am editing to add this: In the left App field - instead of required power was a text that said \u201c~infinity\u201d\u2026</p>\n<p>Today I couldn\u2019t do a workout. At all. Just couldn\u2019t go more than 3 minutes. The resistance of the trainer was going up until I couldn\u2019t turn the pedals anymore. I THINK (not sure) that the cadence was UNDER-reporting - since I was turning like mad to compensate for the difficulty- but the app displayed cademce 60 (I know what 60 is \u2026 it was not).</p>\n<p>I tought the trainer has some issue  (since I use a neo 2 t \u2026 and they are known for electronical failures). \u2026 so I payed just now for trainer road \u2026 and did a workout without any problems \u2026</p>\n<p>I am not insane. Really. (my mother had me tested\u2026<img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=9\" title=\":smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smile:\"> I will try again tomorrow and take screenshots if it happens again\u2026 but I am sure something\u2019s up. Don\u2019t know what though \u2026</p>\n<p>Some details that may or may not help:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trainer - Tacx Neo 2T (plugged in - not on self-power)</li>\n<li>using the IOS App on a phone -iPhone 14 Pro Max - IOS 17.2.1</li>\n<li>using a cheap Bryton chest HR monitor</li>\n<li>normal bike, cleats \u2026</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thankyou for your time and for the great app ! I look forward to using it ALOT.</p>\n<p>Popte.</p>",
