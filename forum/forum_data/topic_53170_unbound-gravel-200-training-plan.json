I personally believe in most cases training plans associated with a specific event are marketing but at the same time something just oriented to 14 hours or something of lots of climbing, but still that ends up a volume plan focused on zone 2 but with some spikes.  I need to research this a bit more if you want some help, I have a world tour coach that designed Coach Jack to ask.  And Coach Robert <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/robert_ucl\">@Robert_UCL</a> Any thoughts on this?</p>",

It\u2019s a mountain bike race in the Netherlands. Since it is the 29th of December, the circumstances are brutal. Wet, cold, and mud.</p>\n<p>A lot of this:<br>\n<img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/7/72859574b2b06a856a3166b52bea0456a492b01a.jpeg\" alt=\"drenthe200\" data-base62-sha1=\"gl6DhFmo87Jh3vR731lbpPsrWEW\" width=\"287\" height=\"175\"></p>\n<p>This year I want to ride 500km in one day. I just turned 50.</p>\n<p>I like the long distances. It is really all about staying in the race and avoid taking risks. In unbound, risk is part of the game with the rugged terrain and sharp stones. You need a little bit of luck as well.</p>\n<p>With distances like these, zone 2 becomes even more important. And you need to do the extra hours. I always say that you don\u2019t need to do at least 2hour sessions for 4 or 5 times a week, but that is for century rides.</p>\n<p>This is something else. You want to build your fatigue resistance by making a lot of hours, while avoiding overtraining.</p>\n<p>A good way to do so is two-day LSD rides. So 5 hours on a Saturday and 4 on a Sunday. During the week I would focus on some zone 4 work.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know the climbs and how steep they are, but I took a look at the route. Everybody talks about short hills with a rocks. That means hammering up technical parts.</p>\n<p>This is one training I would do. Go out with your bike and go for those technical climbs.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know how much time you have during the week, but here would be my schedule.</p>\n<p>Mo: rest<br>\nTue: 2-hour zone 2/3 ride with technical climbs outside<br>\nWed: 1-hour recovery ride and core training (split session)<br>\nThu: 2-hour zone 2 ride with zone 4 intervals<br>\nFri: Recovery ride and core training (split session)<br>\nSat: 3-6 hour zone 2<br>\nSun: 2-5 hour zone 2 (after 3 hours some zone 3 intervals)</p>\n<p>I would build up zone 4 in 4 weeks and then change the intervals. For example, week 1-4 3\u2019 intervals, week 5-8 6\u2019 intervals, etc.</p>\n<p>If you have more time, you can extend the midweek training to 3 hours. If you don\u2019t, you can cut the midweek training to 1 hour and skip the recovery training.</p>\n<p>Make sure that your fueling strategy is spot on. Plan a longer ride (150 miles) in 8 weeks to test your strategy.</p>\n<p>Believe me when I tell you this will be your biggest problem. Eating all the food you need that day.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m a little jealous. If you have any questions you know where to find me.</p>\n<p>Have fun, Coach Robert</p>",
