Sometimes that is the case but in most scenarios I create a (dummy) plan to get a specific workout.</p>\n<p>I hope you understand what I\u2019m trying to say? If there is already a similar request: Sorry but I didn\u2019t see that and thus you can close this thread!</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nStephan</p>",

I fully understand the \u201cwhat\u201d you are requesting but I don\u2019t necessary understand the why or how you plan to use it.

Meaning because in general it\u2019s hard to search/find a specific number of intervals or because you are following a CJ plan and want to repeat something or another reason?  Maybe this feature in the app would be enough if you could just send it to another platform\u2026  I am not opposed to your idea or let\u2019s say I like it, just trying to understand.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Thanks for your detailed answer.</p>\n<p>The reason why I am asking this is that I \u201cdynamically\u201d changed the length of my training plan. First I had a plan with one single event in April. Thus I\u2019m now in the peak block with demanding intervals like VO2max <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#16</span> or similar. When I\u2019m now extending my plan to let\u2019s say June the blocks get stretched or rather it\u2019s switching to a base block where a peak block was before. Thus I\u2019m not able to go one with my hard intervals (VO2max <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#17</span>, <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#18</span> etc. for example) but instead have VO2max <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#7</span> or something like that instead.</p>\n<p>To put it in other words: What should I do if I extend my plan and thus the blocks got stretched and shifted (maybe kind of a newbie question because I got now professionell background)?</p>",
