My latest testing is a product supposedly giving 90g of carbs (ratio2:1 maltodextrin-to-fructose) to 50dl water, and if I am honest, I don\u2019t actually think I feel anything from them.<br>\nSo my discussion question is. Being honest, do you actually feel anything or do you just believe you can perform longer when using them? Would plain water and a bread and jam sandwich be just as good?</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>While this sounds like a pretty straight forward question, I\u2019m on a journey myself at the moment that is related to this question and it\u2019s not \u201cthat straightforward\u201d.  Since about a month I started to eat differently and avoid carbs and sugar.  Not religious like a keto diet, but pragmatic.  The aim is to loose weight ahead of the summer with some big climbing rides planned.  Works very well.  But then add cycling and training and it becomes a bit more challenging.  And not very scientific, this is what I feel.<br>\nEven if I stick to zone2 training, and in theory, should not need carbs, the first couple of weeks, this didn\u2019t work.  I felt like I needed some carbs.  I guess my body was adapting to using fat as an energy source.  and I guess this adaptation didn\u2019t just go \u201covernight\u201d.  Now I\u2019m about 4 weeks in.  When I do a zone2 ride, my body is fine.  It\u2019s not asking for something extra any more.  But : when I do another type of effort, whole different story.  Which makes sense of course.  So when I plan at HIIT training, or when I do an outdoor hilly ride where I don\u2019t stick to zone 2, I add some gels and bars.  Your question is : do you feel the difference.  The answer is : you bet.  If you endurance effort however stays in zone2, it\u2019s perfectly possible you don\u2019t feel the need for any of this.<br>\nThis is just how I feel it <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",

For me all processed carbs give me a buzz.  I believed the marketing around a product called Glycofuse, being delayed release and less of the glucose/insulin negatives  processed carbs.  It might not be real.  I think I tested them with a glucose monitor and did not see the spikes but I am not 100% sure on that.</p>\n<p>I like Glycofuse but more because of the taste/feeling similar to drinking powered lemonade with out the extreme sugar rush.  I get motivation from most products like this but I have used them more for weight lifting motivation then endurance performance.</p>\n<p>I have also tested zone 2 running fasted and after a year of doing this I felt fine up to about 2 and 1/2 hours of running before needing some nuts.  I do think you can become a good fat burner but so far I have never felt the ability to do longer hard efforts on low/zero carbs.</p>",

After a lot of reading I decided to go for Zone2 training last September.  I have spend first a couple of months doing mainly indoor Zone2 training.  When the weather allowed it, I went outside for a ride.  At that time, I was no able yet do really do a Zone2 ride outside.  Take Strava as an example:<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6a5750e848d84670d40fba4d45c6e8c21d23efe3.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/6a5750e848d84670d40fba4d45c6e8c21d23efe3\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6a5750e848d84670d40fba4d45c6e8c21d23efe3_2_690x396.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"faJGvyNVWlhW7rybpx8DyeMYfOH\" width=\"690\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6a5750e848d84670d40fba4d45c6e8c21d23efe3_2_690x396.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6a5750e848d84670d40fba4d45c6e8c21d23efe3_2_1035x594.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6a5750e848d84670d40fba4d45c6e8c21d23efe3_2_1380x792.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6a5750e848d84670d40fba4d45c6e8c21d23efe3_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1392\u00d7800 34.2 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div><br>\nSo funny and so wrong.  When you do Zone2 training, especially indoors, Strava (and Garmin is the same) tell you that you are detraining big time.  No idea why.  Except probably for Garmin it\u2019s marketing related, they want you to go outside :-).  At first it\u2019s frustrating to see.  But I started seeing the joke of it.  If I want to, I can manipulate their graphs by doing a specific workout.  A workout that doesn\u2019t make sense in my training plan.  I\u2019m not interested in that to be honest.  I have my own KPIs, I have my own feeling on the bike and I have my own climbs outside when I want to have some fun and smash some personal records.  So I\u2019m wondering why you say it destroyed your form.  Can be true, but might no be your form but some marketing inspired website.<br>\nFunny side note : Garmin has this indicator : Performance Condition that shows up after about 20min of riding.  Never bothered to find out how to switch it off.  But while Garmin is telling me all week long I\u2019m detraining, when I go out in the weekend for an outdoor ride, my performance condition is at least +4.  So funny, they contradict their own metrics :-).<br>\nSide note 2 : Zone2 training got me from September to December a solid baseline.  Then I started adding some harder workouts about 2 times a week.  That\u2019s when it really started to pay off.  But that\u2019s another story.</p>",

I use Intervals.Icu<br>\nWhat I found mainly was that my FTP dropped by over 10 points during the 6 months I was actively doing the 80/20 principal. However, my power to HR did increase somewhat. I should also mention I live in Norway so I am forced to use a wheel off turbo trainer. I am also 75 yo. I also had a s**t winter with several things upsetting the training. Having said all that, I just felt (Perceived RPE) I was going backwards. This is born out by the fact that I\u2019m now in Spain and a long way behind where I usually am.<br>\nMy feeling is that low intensity training perhaps isn\u2019t for everyone and that some need other types of training. Could be physiological but thats my feeling. Anyway, I\u2019m now just using a few weeks in Spain getting used to being back on the bike with friends then back to Norway and focus a little more on endurance riding in hilly Norway.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>So from my experience, reading and talking to coaches your case is the most typical.  If you do all low intensity when you come back to moderate to hard intensity it feels very hard and you feel off.  This should change quickly.  So you should have this new higher aerobic base (based on hr/power) but you still can feel off.  Just give it a month and hopefully and usually you will feel amazing and stronger than ever.</p>\n<p>I mention this often but they first year, I coached a guy (Roger) he won his US state championship for his age group at the age of 75 he did all zone 2 in the winter indoors and then switched and slowly increased intensity outdoors.  Now he is 78 and still trains the same way and still feel very fast by late spring.</p>\n<p>Now all that said.  Joe Friel says 50+ riders should include some intensity all year round.  That could be 5-10 minutes a week for example.  If you do 100% low intensity (according to Joe) you will start to loose your ability to do this hard work.</p>\n<p>Both Andrea and I both feel Joe offers good advice in most cases.  Like most everyone some times he contradicts himself but overall it seems solid.</p>",
