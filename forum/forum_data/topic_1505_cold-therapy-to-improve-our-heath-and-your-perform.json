I recently started following the Wim Hof method of adding a short duration cold water at the end of a shower and I can say it starts with ending my shower with 10-painful seconds of cold water but in a week it gets much better even for 30-seconds.  Now I am at 50-seconds and other than the first 20-seconds it is not that bad.  Each time, even with 10-seconds.  I would say I felt great for the proceeding hour after that.</p>\n<p>Regarding the Wim Hof method.  HIs Amazon book has 7,000 5-star reviews.  Many people say they used to get sick often and now do not.</p>",
