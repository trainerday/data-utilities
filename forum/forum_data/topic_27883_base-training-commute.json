I\u2019m a pretty experienced (but very average recreational) cyclist, but first time trying structured training. I\u2019m 62 years old.<br>\nMy problem is I\u2019m obliged to spend 7 to 10 hours a week commuting. About 60 km per day, 3 to 4 days a week. Each commute with about a 200 m climb at the end.<br>\nToo much traffic, etc for a structured workout, and the climbing part makes it practically impossible to stay in zone 2. I\u2019ve thought of various strategies for dealing with this. Wondering if anyone has any thoughts. These pertain to winter base period.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Just ride as slow as possible on the climbs, even if it entails some zone 3 and 4.</li>\n<li>Do the climbs at zone 4 and 5, avoiding zone 3.</li>\n<li>Do the climbs in too large gearing, for a sort of weight-lifting type activity.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t worry about numbers, just avoid leg burn, and ride such that recovery each day is no problem.<br>\nAny thoughts ?</li>\n</ol>",

      "cooked": "<p>So, I think the commuting is not the problem. In fact I know some people who only commute for several years, and who didn\u2019t do any structured workouts. They even haven\u2019t an idea of their ftp. One did a stress ecg at the doctors and reached 300w with no problem and even getting not close to max hr.<br>\nThe really average person falls from the bike reaching 120w or something like this.<br>\nSo in my opinion commuting 7 to 10 hours a week is great training. Consistency is king.</p>\n<p>But one question: why can\u2019t you do the climb in Z2? Is it too steep? Because with the right gears nearly all climbs could be ridden in Z2.</p>\n<p>So here is my opinion:<br>\nActually your body doesn\u2019t have any idea of these 5+ zone models. The body can do aerobic and anaerobic work. That\u2019s it. So don\u2019t worry about the numbers or zones.<br>\nJust ride your bike, try to be most time below your aerobic threshold (so you could speak sentences, but listeners would recognise you are working out). Do once a week or twice a month (depending of your ability to recover) an high effort, probably at the end of your workout, e.g. climbing the hill as fast as you can. You can then also track your progression at that last climb.</p>",

I barely rode for 2 months and rode with no power meter for several months, and it now has me at 185. I did some 30 minute tests with the -5%, and came up with 205. I did a ramp test on trainerday, but I thought I was on half power, and it wound up giving me an estimate of 390, ha ha! So I need to redo it, but I think I\u2019m somewhere around 200.

I\u2019m enjoying so far this riding easy business. I\u2019ve done it a couple of weeks now and never feel that tired. Always easy to get on the bike. It may just be the power of suggestion, but it seems like a good change.<br>\nFinally, I also have a friend who almost never trains outside of this same commute (except he has no climb on the way home). Guy does really well in these kind of events. And he just declared his retirement. We\u2019ll see what he does now.</p>",

Now, when I don\u2019t eat all day, it\u2019s never a problem.<br>\nFound your long discussions on zone 2 / aerobic threshold, and found them really interesting. I\u2019m convinced I need to give this a serious try.
