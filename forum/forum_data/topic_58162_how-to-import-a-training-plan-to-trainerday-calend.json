      "cooked": "<p>Hey Alex,</p>\n<p>As the title says, racing season has just ended I\u2019ve gone ahead and built myself a 4-phase off-season training plan. It\u2019s my first real year of taking training seriously, but still don\u2019t have the money for a coach at this point so have used the internet to build a training plan which I\u2019m looking forward to testing.</p>\n<p>Main question is, what is the best way to bulk-import this training plan into my TrainerDay calendar? If I have to manually hand-bomb it, so be it but would really rather not. Effectively would like to fill out an excel of my duration and target watts for each set, and have a tab for each day or something, then upload it all at once to then populate in my calendar and auto-sync to my Wahoo ELEMNT. Easy as right?</p>\n<p>Anyways if this isn\u2019t possible let me know but would love to get around it!</p>",
