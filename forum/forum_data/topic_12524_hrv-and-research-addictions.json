Let\u2019s be very straightforward on this. All I did was gathering information  from different trustworthy people working hard on this topic from a research point. And I tried to put things together to the best of my knowledge. The only practical experience I have is the one from my own data.<br>\nA bit of background: I\u2019m an engineer and have been in after sales support for over 30 years. The first decade at the once so majestic Kodak company\u2026 Then I switched to the medical domain where I\u2019m active in diagnostics divisions, Neurocare, Pneumology and Cardiology. Been an amateur cyclist since my midlife crisis <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> and always hungry for data that can help me understand what my body goes through during and after sports training and events. The daytime job gave me more knowledge on sports physics and access to some lab measurement tools that would have cost a fortune if I didn\u2019t have this job. I\u2019m also kind of a \u2018perfectionist\u2019, which sometimes is good and other times, well, not so good. I gave morning HRV a first shot about 10-12 years ago, ended up with a lot of data gathered with Sporttracks but was never able to turn it in to something useful and gave up.<br>\nAbout three years ago, our company got the exclusive distribution on a Russian HRV product, which unfortunately still isn\u2019t successful, but my interest on the matter was woken up again. I discovered Marco Altini\u2019s site and started digging.<br>\nOne led to the other and I started reading for days, amazed by the progress that was made. Alan Couzens, Andrew Flatt, Martin Bucheit, Daniel Plews\u2026 All people doing research on HRV and making their findings freely available on the net. The only problem is that there is no \u2018overview\u2019. By the time that I got to a point where I was starting to understand the basics, I already had months of data. Then I sort of reconstructed the HRV4training plots in Excel (my programming skills are very limited, not much more then basic vba) and threw it on the Intervals forum. From there, things kind of exploded because so many people were eager to use it. David, the dev and owner of Intervals, provided the necessary programming work to incorporate the charts natively in Intervals. The iThlete training guide came next and Inigo Tolosa, the dev from the alphaHRV IQ field for Garmin, turned it into a very user friendly MatLab script baptised as ImReady4.<br>\nThe evolution on the IQ field for dfa-a1 is now in an experimental stage. Since fixed a1 points had been found unreliable as intensity markers, it now incorporates respiration rate (from HRV). RR/a1 looks very promising as a proxy for lactate measurement. Inigo (an engineer /cyclist coached by Luisma)  is further developing this and is backed by Luisma. They are testing the algorithms on a quite big number of athletes.<br>\nAs a side project, I\u2019m trying to extract respiration rate from the single lead ECG that can be recorded from the Polar H10. The Fitness dashboard and ECG, which you already mentioned is what I use for recording during indoor training. I\u2019m in contact with Stuart, the dev of the Fitness app and a new version will come in the next weeks.<br>\nAll the above + being an active member on this forum and Intervals + a daytime job + trying to be consistent in training makes me kind of \u2018busy\u2019 <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><br>\nBut I wouldn\u2019t want to miss it because I enjoy it all too much.<br>\nA helping hand by someone with mathematical insight and programming skills (be it a desktop or a phone app or whatever) could bring us even more useful tools. And if something turns out as not useful, who cares? We will still have acquired extra knowledge and skills.</p>",

I surely would do it to myself.</p>\n<p>I should be clear that I think HRV is very useful.  Mayo clinic and the US speed skating team used to use my HRV app.   I even had one lady contact me and thank me and say she believed my app helped her with her success.  I looked her up and that year she won 4-gold medals.</p>\n<p>I personally see very close alignment with HRV, deeply negative TSB and how I feel.  I guess I personally am less interested in it now, as I spent about 5-years with deep fascination and because I solved the problem, I was trying to.  Now actually lowest sleep HR from Garmin watch does the same thing HRV does and it\u2019s simpler.
