For me,  better implementation could add a few simple fields like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RPE per segment, using Borg 0-10 scale, not TR\u2019s bit-too-simple 1-5 scale (or a setting/pref for which scale?)</li>\n<li>Comment field</li>\n<li>Ability to export segments like workouts for e.g. coach / forum comments of just a given region in question. Helps get better advice, faster, if coach / peer doesn\u2019t have to parse which part of workout to comment on. (If they need context, rider could upload both full workout and just the segment in question, too\u2026).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Probably not a quick, easy build, but I\u2019ve messed around with intervals.icu, and haven\u2019t figured out how to do the same thing, there, yet, if even possible (it seems like it is, but TR is waay more instantly intuitive / usable, for me).</p>\n<p>This feature is the only reason for me to consider a TR subscription (in theory, can\u2019t afford right now), in addition to TD, but I\u2019d still want the above mods.</p>\n<p>Conversely, if this is not too hard to do in intervals.icu, or the other apps that always come up (TrainingPeaks, Golden Cheetah?), I\u2019ve been looking for a YouTube tutorial on this, but haven\u2019t found any.</p>\n<p>In TR, it\u2019s so simple and \u2018just works\u2019</p>",

Hope this post wasn\u2019t rude, or maybe it\u2019s a little hard to decipher.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m curious if you might consider implementing this feature to your website app post-ride analysis page, at some point.</p>\n<p>As a beginner, I use this feature a lot in TR, to look at eg heartrate drift and other averages and max values (power, cadence) from eg the first half to the second half of my zone 2 intervals.</p>\n<p>Also, my thoughts, above, about what could be better in the TR version could be used by TrainerDay to kinda leapfrog them, and add another compelling way to differentiate TrainerDay from them.</p>\n<p>It might be fussy to implement their \u201cdrag region\u201d approach, but even simple \u201cstart time\u201d and \u201cend time\u201d fields for creating custom post-ride analysis intervals could work great? (Similar to how your workout creator interface is way simpler than theirs but also is arguably both more advanced and easier to use?)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also occurred to me that I can just design Z2 workouts where I split the Z2 interval into 2 halves, and then I would get this analysis automatically, but sometimes I drift out of parameters for a minute because I\u2019m not glued to the stats while riding, and it\u2019s nice to be able to choose \u201cclean\u201d representative regions, after the fact.</p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p>Thanks for any thoughts or feedback you may have about this idea.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>TR does RPE per workout only, and uses a 5-level RPE scale.</p>\n<p>I would love the option to do RPE per interval (including custom intervals I create post-ride) as it helps me get really granular about, eg watts and heartrate, when I\u2019m trying to find the right \u201ctop of zone 2\u201d gearing with my dumb trainer.</p>\n<p>for instance, yesterday my legs felt just \u201cedge of burn\u201d for the first half of my Z2 interval, but then started to feel more like \u201cslow cumulative burn\u201d and my heart rate drifted up 10% in the second half of my Z 2 interval\u2014so that helped me realize I may need to lower my FTP, slightly, and zone two power target on the trainer.</p>\n<p>In addition to RPE, the ability to add comments to rides, intervals, and post hoc intervals helps me further assess if I <em>really</em> need to mess with my FTP and zones or if I just need to give it another week because I\u2019m e.g. recovering from a cold or something (which I was).</p>\n<p>These rest/recovery factors could become structured data for AI analysis, too, but I get that that might conflict with the \u201csimple\u201d mandate (which I totally agree with\u2014but tradeoffs\u2026)</p>\n<p>So, again, with TR\u2019s implementation, for a zone 2 interval that tips into zone 3 in the second half, it kinda sucks that my only choices are rating the whole ride as moderate or hard. That\u2019s not quite granular enough. Even if I could rate intervals (and post hoc intervals) separately, choosing between moderate and hard is still not granular enough IMO.</p>\n<p>Yes, Borg\u2019s 0-10 RPE scale is less simple, but it\u2019s maybe \u201cas simple as is practical\u201d for reliable polarized training. It\u2019s still super-thoughtful and clear, IMO.</p>\n<p>Apologies for length. I\u2019m super passionate about this, right now!</p>",
