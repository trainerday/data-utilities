I think I am going to have you repeat that to my wife <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">   So the short answer is \u201cnot perfectly like you would think.\u201d  The longer answer is you can set daily time limits that will limit your weekly hours.</p>\n<p>As you have realize, the problem is that modern science shows that you can\u2019t really substitute intensity for volume, which means you can\u2019t arbitrarily increase CTL via TSS and expect to get great results. I realize that TrainerRoad has a lot of people believing otherwise and for sure different people can get results in different ways but generally this is a risky strategy and likely to be less effective than doing less intensity even if the hours are the same (the only thing close to proof we have of this is Seiler/Polarized).</p>\n<p>All this said, we do gradually increase intensity over the course of the plan but do not believe that pure TSS manipulation makes sense.  There is no science showing this is effective.  It was a good theory.  Partially because the opposite holds fairly true.  When you are at your highest CTL you are likely to be in top fitness.  But trying to maximize your CTL by using intensity means you are manipulating the plan based on some random overly simplified math concepts.</p>\n<p>You can still get what you want with Coach Jack by limiting daily hours, increasing intensity a bit in the beginning.  The big difference is it won\u2019t maximize your weekly tss ramp rates by strongly manipulating intensity.  So TSS growth will be less and since you are not increasing volume the gains are likely less than if you could increase your weekly hours.</p>\n<p>Does this all make any sense?  <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">   I can provide more arguments to try to make it more clear if necessary.</p>\n<p>One thing I am saying is the TR approach can work, is it more effective for most? I would argue it is not, although the people that don\u2019t burn out should be reasonably strong.  Will they be in good form after 1 year of maximum CTL focus sweet spot training?  Most will not.</p>\n<p>What I have found is most TR users learn to adapt TR to their needs.  As a build period it can work or for special people it can work\u2026  Generally I really like TR and Nate and what they are doing, especially the software (not their workout creator :)) I liked Chad a lot especially his messaging.  My guess is he was smart enough and wanted to move away from the sweet spot focus but that is pure speculation.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Some food for thought for all time crunched athletes\u2026<br>\nPlease be aware that I perfectly understand your situation. I always had a (overly) full daytime job and I have three kids, all with their own hobby\u2019s and demands. I know that life can be complicated and that lots of situations can have negative impact on your training plan.<br>\nI\u2019m now old enough to have more time available, the kids are all grown up and living their lives. But I still consider time with them and my grand-children as quality time.<br>\nMy idea is that a strict training plan can\u2019t work for time crunched people. You have to be creative and make use of time as efficiently as possible. The first thing that you need to realize is that cycling is an endurance sport. And endurance training doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be all cycling. If you want to go for a planned ride, it takes some time to prepare everything. But any moment of the day can allow you to do some crosstraining with very little preparation. All endurance sports profit from any kind of cardiovascular and/or strength training. So start thinking about dialing that in, in your busy daily life. This can be any form of brisk movement or strength training from 5 min on. If you\u2019re willing to take this approach, you can easily squeeze in multiple hours a week.<br>\nSome examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>brisk walk/jog during lunch break</li>\n<li>walk/jog around the school block iso waiting 15min in the car for your kids to come out at the gate.</li>\n<li>do some burpees, push-ups, squats\u2026 wherever you feel like doing them. Might be just 3-4 minutes before you jump in the shower. It doesn\u2019t matter if it is short or long. Anything of this kind will help you progress.</li>\n<li>check you phone or read that meeting report while \u2018wall-sitting\u2019 iso just sitting at your desk. Don\u2019t under-estimate wall-sitting, it is very taxing on the quads! And those stronger quads will help you cycle faster <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\">\n</li>\n<li>setup your trainer in front of the television and watch that TV show that you don\u2019t want to miss while pedalling along at comfortable intensity iso laying on the couch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At first it takes some effort to build all this in your daily routine, but you\u2019ll be amazed at the effect it can have on your cycling performance. And as soon as this becomes a \u2018habit\u2019, you will do it with very little thinking about it and you will pile up multiple hours per week, all positively influencing your cardiovascular fitness and strength.<br>\nMake sure to always have some sports clothing/shoes in your car and use it iso stressing more behind the steering wheel in another trafic jam. You probably want to add deodorant too\u2026<br>\nJust make a solid plan for the little spare time that you have where you do exactly what was planned. And then take advantage of any possibility that comes along to do something extra in the form of crosstraining/strength training. Don\u2019t think that only longer training sessions on your bike are the only way to become better. EVERYTHING counts, as Alan Couzens always says. The advantage of re-thinking your training this way, is that you will feel less guilty if, once again, something came along that made you dispose your planned training. And believe me, once this becomes a \u2018way of life\u2019 you will feel less stressed and fitter. Avoid wasting time by recycling it into brief fitness time.</p>",

If you frequently need to adjust your indoor bike sessions then instead of using our calendar, push the plan to my plans and select that plan as active in the app and then you just do one workout after then next on the next time you have available. Really from a training perspective doing it on specific days versus when you have time has minimal differences.  3 days in a row is probably not ideal but really these plans are not taxing enough (unless you crank the intensity way up) at least in the beginning that even that is not the end of the world.</p>",

I think this requires a different approach as most training plans will aim for the optimum ratio of input/output wheras in my case I want to maximize the output with a given input (time).</p>\n<p>I would vote for a Coach Jack feature that looks at your past workouts (e.g. 42 days) and provides you with a workout recommendation for exactly the time you have. E.g. \u201cThe last 3 days were very intense, do a 30 minute recovery ride today\u201d or \u201cYour training load was moderate, I recommend a short interval session at VO2max\u201d.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know if that makes sense\u2026</p>",
