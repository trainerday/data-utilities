It \u201cgets stuck\u201d and no matter if I\u2019m in ERG, RES, or HR it does not respond and stays at the same difficulty.</p>\n<p>I had wanted to set up a workout as ERG for warm up, change to HR+, and then back to ERG for the cooldown.

      "cooked": "<p>Oops missed responding to this. Hmm, so trainers require us to \u201crequest control\u201d we do this at the beginning of a workout and a few other cases.  If for some reason your trainer takes away the control of our app then it will not longer respond to our requests.  Our app frequently does not get notified of this.  My belief is this happens more with Saris devices.  This can happen when some other device or app requests control or just some error that occurs in the device itself.</p>\n<p>To handle this we used to request control every 1 second to make sure we alway had control and while that helped with issues like this, it actually caused problems with other devices.  We are trying to find a hybrid solution now.  It\u2019s possible this other problem other users occasionally have will resolve your issue.  It should not matter if you are using HR+ or ERG mode because from your device perspective they are both ERG.  We are just automatically controlling the ERG power target in HR+.</p>",
