Thus with very little time left to prepare for that chalenge.<br>\nI could offcourse be totaly wrong with this assumption but that\u2019s just the picture my mind is sending me when reading you post. If that is wrong, my apologies, it is certainly not my intention to be rude. But if it is like that, I consider it my duty to warn you and protect you from overdoing it and hurting yourself.<br>\nDo you have some sort of endurance sport history other then cycling that would be solid  enough to be considered as a fairly good base fitness?<br>\nIf not, I would strongly suggest rethinking your plan and get in a number of weeks with base endurance training. The FTP plan you mentioned is not a beginner\u2019s plan. You need a minimal base fitness to tolerate such a hard plan. Without a good base fitness, this plan will have you toasted before you reach the fourth week, best case and worst case you will be left with an injury.<br>\nRegarding the ramp test:<br>\nIf your FTP is set at 150W, the last stage would have been at least 200W, but normally the ramp test has a couple of extra stages. So it could have been around  240-260W. If you reached 240W, the FTP estimation would the be 3/4 of that value and return 180W. That\u2019s nowhere near what you are reporting. Are you sure, you correctly understood how this test should be done?<br>\nWhat I can tell you regarding the ramp test is that once it starts feeling hard, you\u2019re usualy finished within the next two or three stages.<br>\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to correct any misinterpretation from my side and post all the questions you have. We are here to help. Just try to give us some more information that will allow us to guide you in the right and healthy direction!</p>",

I am indeed a young person who takes on challenges but live in hope that I might start acting a bit more maturely when I hit my 58th year next month. Not holding out too much hope though!</p>\n<p>A brief resume\u2026\u2026<br>\nten years as a bike messenger in London, many extended cycle tours in various parts of the globe, including deserts, rainforests and big mountains (love cycling up long hills - I\u2019m a bit of a pervert when it comes to gradients!). 24hr mountain bike racing, endurance road cycling, including the Paris - Brest-Paris, and more gentle bike touring in mainland Europe towing one of the kids and all the family camping gear around for up to a month at a time.</p>\n<p>Anyway,</p>\n<p>I\u2019m now working 12 hr night shifts and not getting out on the bike as frequently so have bought a smart trainer (Kickr Core). I\u2019m also a little out of shape after Covid and some time off the bike due to other circumstances.</p>\n<p>As my previous riding has been get-out-and-ride rather than structured I\u2019m new to ramp tests, FTP, watt generation and other sports science.</p>\n<p>So, I may be wrong but I was guessing that if I adjusted my FTP to 400 in my TD profile then I would be more likely to max out before the ramp test finished and, therefore, get a more realistic/accurate FTP reading which I\u2019d input into my profile, replacing the temporary 400 FTP. The further workouts in my programme would then be adjusted to my more realistic FTP and I\u2019d get more returns from the effort I put into them?</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Ricky</p>\n<p>(Also, until recently had a 25km commute to work with 700m of climbing. Sometimes did it fixed wheel but the down hills were a bit annoying!)</p>",

When you set an FTP that is way too high, the steps will be big and you will have to quit early. The result is highly influenced by your anaerobic capacity in that case and probably too high.<br>\nBut with your history, 118W is way too low. I agree with Alex that something around 250w (3-3.5W/kg bodyweight) should be a good first estimate.<br>\nA word of caution: Since you\u2019re not used to do structured work, just make sure to listen to your body and don\u2019t overdo the hard work. Recent science shows clearly that low intensity endurance work has almost unlimited growing capacity. Overdose on high intensity breaks you down.</p>",
