Really for Z2 HR training our free version is all you likely need. <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=9\" title=\":thinking:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":thinking:\">   I have not completely abandoned it but questioned the value and exploring deeper discussions.</p>\n<p>Most people doing hr training have simple intervals. Staying in zone is pretty easy once you determine the watts you need for that hr target. It might change next week but pressing + - should keep you at your target or using slope mode with a gear or cadence change.</p>\n<p>That said what seems much simpler and just as useful is just how Garmin or polar do hr based running with beep sounds when you are out of zone if you want to veg out and watch Netflix for example. Does that make sense to you?</p>\n<p>You can estimate your ftp from z2 hr and power if you know your max measured hr although maybe it\u2019s different now. I would set zone 2 limit where you start to notice the slightest amount of breath change and reduce it by about 5 beats.  Maffetone says 180-age-10 (due to drugs), his calc usually is pretty close.  FTP does not matter that much but knowing your aerobic threshold AeT is for z2 training.</p>",

I already do use Garmin zones (with the beep) to set targets \u2013 but would rather have it in TD app to adjust resistance instead of just backing off (either cadence or downshift). As I mentioned, my ideal Z2 workout aligns HR between, say 60-70% (max is 166 on beta blockers based on my last cardiac stress test), while adjusting flywheel resistance. That will also work my muscles a bit more than just reducing cadence, I think.
