      "cooked": "<p>Hi there!<br>\nI love your app! It is exactly what I need!<br>\nI came here from TrainerRoad and left there because I felt exactly the same way about it as Dylan Johnson described in his video recently, but my criticism was not as well founded scientifically.</p>\n<p>However, I am puzzled with the different ramp test workouts!<br>\nOn my app there is a workout in the default list \u201c20-Free App Workouts\u201d called \u201cTrainerDay Ramp test\u201d. This is the automatic ramp test that goes on until I fail and then auto-calculates the new FTP. So far so good.</p>\n<p>It appears that I cannot find this workout in the web interface to add it to another list. I usually plan my workouts from the web interface. This week I accidentally scheduled another ramp test workout called \u201cRamp test\u201d. I found it in the list \u201cFavorites\u201d. I cannot remember to have created that list at all. Unfortunately this is a different ramp test, that is not scripted, but rather ends after some max value. Very unfortunate, in my case the test ended at approximately 95 % of what I was capable of pushing. Imagine how frustrated I felt after going through 95 % of the pain and then getting nothing out of it!</p>\n<p>I would love it to be clearer what ramp test is the scripted one from TrainerDay! Ans also being able to save it to a custom list.<br>\nDoing the wrong workout accidentally is frustrating!</p>\n<p>Cheers<br>\nOliver</p>",
