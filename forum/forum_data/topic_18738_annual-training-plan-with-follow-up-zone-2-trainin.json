They had one called Build Me Up, which raised my ftp about 10% over 13 weeks and I felt very strong afterwards.</p>\n<p>I am about to finish a CJ 16 week Base ++ plan.  I chose this because the 1 day of intervals takes away the monotony of Z2 rides. I have stuck to the plan except that I generally ride a little above the plan on some days as opposed to below it, but no more than 10%.  And a couple of long weekends I was travelling and skipped training, and a couple that I did longer Saturday rides.</p>\n<p>I am now very comfortable riding at 70% ftp for 4-6 hours which is an improvement.  But now I find it exhausting to ride at 100% ftp for even 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>Here is my Intervals.icu for the past 6 months:<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/7/78ca409e5a6c23257a0125d8826167a08abae08d.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/78ca409e5a6c23257a0125d8826167a08abae08d\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/78ca409e5a6c23257a0125d8826167a08abae08d_2_690x318.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"heyCsgGbRORBQsWvY7K4WGmMV6l\" width=\"690\" height=\"318\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/78ca409e5a6c23257a0125d8826167a08abae08d_2_690x318.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/78ca409e5a6c23257a0125d8826167a08abae08d_2_1035x477.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/78ca409e5a6c23257a0125d8826167a08abae08d_2_1380x636.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/78ca409e5a6c23257a0125d8826167a08abae08d_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1503\u00d7693 134 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>Here is a 2 hour ride from 2 weeks ago:<br>\nPower:<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9791ab72798923443819211e0d379b0ef6fda1ec.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/9791ab72798923443819211e0d379b0ef6fda1ec\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/9791ab72798923443819211e0d379b0ef6fda1ec_2_690x433.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"lCQc1B1ysiG0W7v8l18MfW0JoTy\" width=\"690\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/9791ab72798923443819211e0d379b0ef6fda1ec_2_690x433.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9791ab72798923443819211e0d379b0ef6fda1ec.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9791ab72798923443819211e0d379b0ef6fda1ec.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/9791ab72798923443819211e0d379b0ef6fda1ec_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">893\u00d7561 66.2 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>Heart Rate:<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e30cd87c1417d9a333c5dca8f2a92aa0f8374514.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/e30cd87c1417d9a333c5dca8f2a92aa0f8374514\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e30cd87c1417d9a333c5dca8f2a92aa0f8374514_2_690x433.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"wozUgg74445wPKcun15CpVj7ROc\" width=\"690\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e30cd87c1417d9a333c5dca8f2a92aa0f8374514_2_690x433.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e30cd87c1417d9a333c5dca8f2a92aa0f8374514.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e30cd87c1417d9a333c5dca8f2a92aa0f8374514.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e30cd87c1417d9a333c5dca8f2a92aa0f8374514_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">893\u00d7561 61.6 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>First Question - is it normal that my power is zone 2-3 and my heart rate is zone 5-6?

So instead of Z2 rides I have been doing consistent Z3 or 4 rides, and never recovering well.</li>\n<li>I had a sinus infection in December that never completely healed and just started another round of antibiotics, so my body hasn\u2019t been fully healthy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So immediate next steps: I think I should take it easy until the antibiotics are finished now, then do an ftp test, start a new training plan, and exercise self-control to stay in the training session zones each day.  It has taken time for me to get used to Z1-2 rides and realizing that I can ruin a z2 ride by spiking power for a short time, which I did a lot.</p>\n<p>That leads to Question 2 - If I could pick a set of training plans for 12 months, what would that look like?

If you are still on antibiotics, and want to recover, high training stress does not help at all, it lowers your immune system and makes it harder to recover.  So I would do what ever you can do to easier training.  Z1 or Z2 heart rate max, until this is resolved.  If you can\u2019t do it on the bike start walking, or light hiking.  Find another sport temporarily.  Do indoor and watch netflix in ERG mode.  Find someone outdoors that is really slow you can ride with.  Recover.  It will feel like you are loosing a lot but you are not, it\u2019s a very temporary loss and building or at least maintaining your aerobic system which is most important as it takes the longest to build. The anaerobic loss is very temporary.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>Thanks for the thoughts and I am definitely taking it easing until this sinus thing is cleared up.</p>\n<p>I tend to get out of Z2 on the trainer and outdoors.  Hills and competition are my nemesis.  I realize I need to show self control to gain the benefits of the training.  I am becoming convinced of the benefits of the style of training you use and getting better at staying in the zones.</p>\n<p>I apologize for the lengthy essay below, but you asked\ud83d\ude0e:<br>\n<em>Please tell me more about how you like to train/ride. Indoor/outdoor\u2026 any goals you have.</em></p>\n<p><strong>I ride for fitness, pleasure and a little competition.</strong>  I usually ride indoors most of the winter in Nebraska.  All year I ride 3-4 weekday mornings indoors about 15 minutes after getting up. These can be up to 2 hours, but usually between 1 and 1.5 hours. On the off days I do situps, pushups, some weights. Saturdays I have been doing 3-4+ hour rides indoor or outdoor as the weather allows.  On the trainer I have a rocker board with side to side and fore/aft motion, and I can ride comfortably on it for 4+ hours.  Have done as many as 12 hours once working on virtual everest.  I try to do 2-3 centuries each summer and hoping to do some bike packing in Colorado this summer in the mountains.</p>\n<p>I have been on TD about 2 years. It was my first experience with 80/20, polarized, zone 2, etc.  Rouvy is my app of choice.  I select a route, then have a 2nd device with the TD plan, and adjust gears/cadence to maintain the workout\u2019s power zones.  I found it very hard to stick to the plan in the beginning. I wanted to speed up a hill, or catch someone riding nearby, and therefore killed the 80/20 rule.  But I am doing much better, and can stick to it pretty well for base training.</p>\n<p><strong>I want to strengthen my riding to go faster</strong>.  I do a lot of elevation gain on the Rouvy routes and feel comfortable climbing long hills.  I started training about 3 years ago so I think I have room to advance before old age takes over - I am 61.</p>\n<p>I have done a base plan, an SFR, and most recently a Fitness Cyclist plan.</p>\n<p><strong>So what is next?</strong>  I have seen some comments around where guys have an annual cycle they run thru.  Like base for x months, then build for x months, then peaking during the summer, a few weeks off, then back to base and start again.  Is this a good plan?  Do you suggest something different?  Either way how can I do it with TD and or Coach Jack?</p>\n<p>The one thing I miss in TD is cadence goals in the workouts.  I did a couple of plans in other apps that had this and I felt it helped a lot.</p>\n<p>I enjoy the community here and appreciate everyone\u2019s input - I am learning a ton.  Thanks.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>I will give more response soon, but if you set an event date for 26 weeks, and do 2 of those in coach jack it will create a base&gt;build&gt;peak plan for you.  Traditionally racers do an annual plan of</p>\n<p>base &gt; build &gt; peak &gt; \u201crace\u201d &gt; transition &gt; cross train &gt; base again</p>\n<p>Each one of these cycles you can usually get a bit faster, so doing 2 a year might give you the maximum benefit but doing a more strict zone 2 period in the summer months might be hard unless as it gets hot in Nebraska you do most rides indoors.  So using ERG mode for zone 2 work is beneficial because then you have no choice but to stay on target, then you can even watch TV and just pedal.  I coached a 75 year old to his top performance (won Tennessee state championship for his age) using strict base periods of strict z2 in Zwift.  Like you he was overly motivated so giving his body more of a rest period of z2 and building aerobic only helped him be in top form in the spring.</p>\n<p>Generally it\u2019s best to pick a period or periods of the year where you are in top form and late spring is very traditional for this.</p>",

We use cadences for strength / endurance workouts for example (SFR and dynamic force).  Generally setting your own variation of cadences is enough to give your body the chance to potentially adapt and find a new natural best.  I would say when you know your natural cadence try increasing it by 10% on some intervals on some workouts.  You could try dropping by 10% also.</p>",

The reason is that your body switches the energy system from fat to carbs in the blink of an eye when the effort can no longer be fueled on fat, but it takes another 20-30min to return to a maximized fat burning state. Your target for those endurance focused workouts should be the zone of 0-15 bpm below the MAF value. Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that higher is better. You need to use the complete zone to make sure that you improve at 125, but also at 110.<br>\nIf you want to incorporate some intensity, do the higher effort bouts at the end of your session. Doing 5-10 sprints at the end of an endurance session during a taper for example is a perfect way to get your endurance time in and to make sure that you don\u2019t loose top end power.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Sceva\" data-post=\"10\" data-topic=\"18738\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/user_avatar/forums.trainerday.com/sceva/48/1391_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Sceva:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If my Z2 HR is 126bpm, how can I calculate the other zones to enter for Rouvy/Intervals.icu?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>If you use the MAF method, only three zones are important and they don\u2019t necessarily match the zones from other systems. There\u2019s below MAF, above LTHR and in between those two. That\u2019s it. The MAF value is somewhere from 65-80% of FTP in the Power zone system. You can\u2019t say much regarding % of LTHR or max because the better you get at the low zone work, the more the AeT will creep up to LTHR.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Sceva\" data-post=\"10\" data-topic=\"18738\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/user_avatar/forums.trainerday.com/sceva/48/1391_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Sceva:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can I do an occasional race or faster ride?

Al-tough it is advised to have an initial base period with a huge % of the aerobic work and very little intensity to make your body adapt to that.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Sceva\" data-post=\"10\" data-topic=\"18738\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/user_avatar/forums.trainerday.com/sceva/48/1391_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Sceva:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can I do some strength training - nothing major, say push ups, situps, lunges, squats?

If cycling performance is your priority, do your strength training after your cycling workout.

They both have ANT+ and BLE connection technology, so you should be able to connect them to any of your devices. They are also both capable of recording rMSSD, should you ever go the route of HRV. Most cheap straps \u2018filter\u2019 the HR signal too much. They hide the low performance of the hardware by aggressively cleaning the low quality signal. They also last less long and in the end you end up spending more money.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Sceva\" data-post=\"10\" data-topic=\"18738\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/user_avatar/forums.trainerday.com/sceva/48/1391_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Sceva:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am planning to cut back on my sugar intake, but would a specific diet (Keto was mentioned often in the thread) be helpful?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>That\u2019s not my cup of tea, someone else may be able to better help you with that.</p>\n<p>EDIT: forgot to add one thing that anyone should give some good thinking. In the marathon and ultra-endurance scene, the saying goes: \u2018as soon as your HR reaches 3 digits, you are training your endurance and improving VO2max\u2019. So don\u2019t be afraid of going slow, it is way better to go slow (for long enough) then going too hard. You don\u2019t have to be out of breath and sweating like a ** to improve your condition/performance. The high intensity is the icing on the cake, but you first need to make a good cake.</p>",

Seasonally you probably need to include a little intensity or possibly once every 2 week.  Short high efforts are probably enough (More polarized than polarized :)).  Joe friel seems to think older athletes need a little intensity all year long (once a week or so).  Since I know a few older athletes that have just killed it doing almost only zone 2, I am not so sure.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>4 month update</p>\n<p>After riding mostly z2 for 3 months I decided to have a \u2018fun\u2019 December and rode a mix of z2 and free rides (around threshold) before starting a 4-month polarized plan on 1/1/24.</p>\n<p>I have a few questions about the polarized plan.  I created a <a href=\"https://app.trainerday.com/plans/steves-polarized-plan-winter-2024\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coach Jack plan</a> with 4 riding days each week.  1 vo2 max, 2 endurance, and 1 longer Tempo ride.  Based on the watts the endurance and tempo rides will be above my Z2 max HR.  Should I make any of these HR based or stick with power?</p>\n<p>I am planning to ride these in Rouvy using the TP WOD connection.  If I adjust my FTP in TD during the plan do I need to do anything to update the calendar workouts to reflect the FTP change?</p>\n<p>This is my first polarized plan so any tips on how to succeed and finish it?</p>\n<p>Here are some thoughts after the Z2 deep dive:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I noticed early on I could ride with more power and stay below the Z2 HR max by reducing my cadence to the mid 70\u2019s.  Normally I average 95 rpm, so this was a big change for me.  I feel stronger and can ride uphill at lower cadence more comfortably than before.</li>\n<li>I was amazed how doing anything extra while riding in Z2 (like getting a drink of water, sitting up and grabbing a towel, changing position on the handlebars) could cause my HR to spike 5 beats.  I learned to reduce my cadence before sitting up!</li>\n<li>The biggest benefit I noticed is doing long rides - I can ride longer with more comfort and ease.</li>\n<li>But I feel like I lost on the higher end - It is harder to ride at threshold or around my FTP for even 5 or 10 minutes.</li>\n<li>I did an ftp ramp test yesterday and tanked out at 300w for an ftp of 225.  This is about the same ftp as 4 months ago.</li>\n<li>I am OK with <span class=\"hashtag\">#5</span> as I am realizing FTP is only 1 metric in analyzing fitness.  Hopefully I am ready to reap the benefits of the Build phase.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Happy New Year!</p>",
