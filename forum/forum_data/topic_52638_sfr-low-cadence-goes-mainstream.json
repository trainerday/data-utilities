Andrea was Aldo Sassi\u2019s right hand and together they produced world tour winners and SFR (low cadence) has always been one of their key workouts.</p>\n<p>Now GCN has done a review of this, and says while limited scientific proof, he still believes it sounds like a good idea to him. He also states pros and pro coaches recommend it.  Also he mentions Aldo as a forefather of this.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-onebox lazy-video-container\" data-video-id=\"d_AsI7ptAVU\" data-video-title=\"Pedal Slower, Ride Faster?!\" data-video-start-time=\"\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_AsI7ptAVU\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"video-thumbnail\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <img class=\"youtube-thumbnail\" src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4891483fc7991b024ab3fc9e7f90bdd6ee5bcb24.jpeg\" title=\"Pedal Slower, Ride Faster?!\" data-dominant-color=\"733B3D\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n<p>But he is also pointing out that strength training could be an alternative solution and is more proven.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Here\u2019s my 2 cents on this.  I just watched the video yesterday.  In 2000 when I was in my 20\u2019s and very fit I did just this.  I lived just around the corner from Mt Lemmon in Tucson, AZ and would ride up it 2-3 days a week.  I was specifically training for the AZ HC championships which back then took place at Mt Graham.  I would routinely do 10-15 min intervals at low cadence in the big ring (53x16/17) all the way up to Windy Point (mile marker 14).  On the way down I would do high cadence spins at 180-200 + rpm\u2019s.  In the lead up to the HC champs I won the Tumacocori RR (hilly circuit) when 3 of us went off the front on the first lap.i went to cover the attack initially since no one else did but after a few laps i was committed and went for it.  I ended up being the only one to survive and hold off the field.  At the HC champs I rode a 1988 steel specialized Allez with zipp440 wheels.  So not a light weight bike.  I finished 5th overall.  I was 1st in Cat 3 by well over 2 minutes.  I would\u2019ve been the 2nd Cat 2 finisher. I don\u2019t recall if there were any pros there or not.   When I raced I rode a normal 90rpm range.</p>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t big into weight training back then so I can\u2019t say how that would\u2019ve been better or worse.  My thought was it was specific on the bike strength training.  To me it combined the concepts of specificity and strength training.</p>\n<p>For what it\u2019s worth, my degree was in exercise physiology so it\u2019s not like I was coming at this without a scientific background and understanding. I always looked at things from a different perspective and was never afraid to \u201ctry something new\u201d</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>I have always been very interested in this topic. All this research saying that it isn\u2019t beneficial, yet so many pro teams with incredible coaches and scientists still have their athletes doing it.</p>\n<p>I just saw a recent analysis of Brandon McNulty\u2019s early season training, and he had a high torque session every week, so you know UAE Emirates definitely thinks it is highly beneficial.</p>\n<p>Personally I know I definitely feel a benefit, but not in terms of true fitness gains. Instead it is getting the body and legs to \u201cfeel\u201d like pedaling and putting down power when torque is higher easier.</p>\n<p>To give an analogy, if you are familiar at all with the sport of baseball, you will see when a batter is warming up they sometimes put weights or \u201cdonuts\u201d on the end of their bat when taking practice swings. After taking some swings with weight on the end, when they take them off, the bat all of a sudden feels incredibly light, and it gives the batter the perception it is easier to swing the bat and make contact with the ball. Ironically there have been studies that show this actually SLOWS down their swing speed immediately after using the weight, meaning that it actually has a negative physical effect but positive mental effect. Yet still tons of pro baseball players and teams use them, even though the science says it has 0 or even negative effects! Seem similar?</p>\n<p>SFR to me is doing the same type of thing to your brain and neural system. You train and get used to pedaling at a very high torque and when you go back to normal cadence even at the same power, your muscles and brain have the perception that it is far easier. And lets face it, perception is reality.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Nice post, Alex.</p>\n<p>Research is only as limited as the question that the researchers ask.</p>\n<p>In this case sfr has continuously been researched compared to strength training and muscle power. The conclusion has, therefore, always been the same: strength training is more efficient to build power in the muscles than sfr.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean that sfr is useless. It is still a good training to build power and it has other benefits as well. You strengthen tendons, get used to low cadence which is very different from high cadence, because you need a different tension in the body and you can do so while riding your bike.</p>\n<p>It is the same discussion as core training. There is no scientific evidence (that I know of <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">) that supports the idea that you\u2019ll be faster on the bike if you do core training. But that is not the question that you should ask yourself.</p>\n<p>I have always recommended sfr to my clients. I hope in the near future scientists will ask the right questions and when they do I\u2019m positive the benefits of SFR will be proven.</p>\n<p>Have a great day, Coach Robert</p>",

There are so many factors that play a role. Powermeters are relatively new to the sport and training and nutrition are going through major breakthroughs. You just have to look at the last cycling season to see the results of those changes.</p>\n<p>Pro cycling is often the playground of science. Sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a bad way. I remember a story from Cadel Evens\u2019 biography about new bikes that where suppose to be cutting edge, but they where so bad that it costed him the gc.</p>\n<p>Most studies are not consistent in their set-up. So generally, a study needs to compare two groups and have a control group. A lot of the time the three groups are loaded differently, therefore the result is not valid.</p>\n<p>For example: in one study there was a low cadence, a high cadence and a control group. All groups had different training hours, with the control group doing only half the hours of the other groups.</p>\n<p>My next point is that most scientific studies are very small. They use 30 elite cyclist or 11 random cyclist. These numbers and there qualifications have an impact on the interpretation of the result. Most of the time we don\u2019t take this into account.</p>\n<p>For example: If a study shows that 10 pro sprinters improved their max power with an sfr program, does that imply that 10 amateure Ultra distance cyclist could benefit the same way?</p>\n<p>Like you stated, there are plenty riders who improve with sfr as part of there training. It is my opion too that it delivers results.</p>\n<p>A hypothsis could well be that it is beneficial for certain riders, while not or limited for others.</p>\n<p>So here is what I found.</p>\n<p>There is a list of studies that have been done on the matter of low cadence. Most of them found no real benefits. Not to make this post any longer than it needs to be, I\u2019ll list the most important studies.</p>\n<p>Ronnestad &amp; Hansen (two big guns in endurance science) did a review study. This is a study where they gather all studies done on the subject. Their conclusion is that there is very little evidene for Low candence training to be effective. Some studies show that it is not effective or even indicate a superior effect in a freely choosen cadence.</p>\n<p>The problem I have with this study is that a lot of the studies they are refering too are not very well executed.</p>\n<p>But here comes the fun part\u2026</p>\n<p>In May 2024 a study was performed if low cadences could produce the same power as weight lifting. The conclusion was that low cadence (40, 60 or 80 rpm) could not produce more than 54% of the maximum power output while weight training.</p>\n<p>However, the same group of researchers published a study recently (Sep '24)on squat power versus low cadence. This study has been set-up way better than all previous studies.</p>\n<p>There conclusion was that low cadence strength training delivered the same results as a weight training program.</p>\n<p>Actually, the low cadence group had better results, but not to a level where it was significant.</p>\n<p>Does that mean that you should stop weight training? Absolutely not. There are more benefits to weight training.</p>\n<p>But is does show that sfr is beneficial.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m trying to arrange an interview with one of the researhers.</p>\n<p>To be continued\u2026</p>",

I think in the cycling world Mark Rippetoe (heavy strength guy) would not be so popular to follow but he makes a good point that a guy that can squat 300kg has a stronger core than a guy that can squat 100kg, 99% of the time even though the first guy does not do any core work.  300kg squat guy surely has a stronger core than cyclists that do core work. Rip said it a bit different but that was his basic idea.   He always is talking about low bar squat which is different than high bar.</p>\n<p>So this seems to be along the lines of what you are suggesting, is that you want a core that supports your needs but there are many ways to skin that cat.  I do believe desk jockey cyclists that don\u2019t do anything else are at risk for back/core related issues but you seem to be suggesting the same, just do something so your imbalances are not too great.</p>",
