I\u2019d expect this has been requested already but are there any plans or is it possible to have workout notes appear on screen in Trainer Day?  I\u2019m thinking in particular of high/low cadence drills and pedaling drills, like what you see in SF and Z, Thanks  Eamonn</p>",

Yes we have \u201cInterval Comments\u201d now but the thing is all our workouts are user contributed and so users would need to add comments for them to appear.</p>\n<p>That said Coach Jack workouts are our workouts (well and some others we have created) but our plans are to add interval comments to Coach Jack workouts.  With Coach Jack right now we also do have cadence targets on two of our Sequences SFR and Dynamic Force.</p>\n<p>So our workout editor supports creating both interval comments as well as cadence targets but I realize you are asking for pre-made workouts.</p>\n<p>You can search and try to find workouts with interval comments but right now most it is just personal notes not something for public use<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/ec82d5ce28b1b5b7c2239fea5f9db04b4d75a236.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/ec82d5ce28b1b5b7c2239fea5f9db04b4d75a236\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ec82d5ce28b1b5b7c2239fea5f9db04b4d75a236_2_690x311.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"xKgZL0uvhdlXg4TYBDFnG6Hmib4\" width=\"690\" height=\"311\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ec82d5ce28b1b5b7c2239fea5f9db04b4d75a236_2_690x311.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ec82d5ce28b1b5b7c2239fea5f9db04b4d75a236_2_1035x466.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/ec82d5ce28b1b5b7c2239fea5f9db04b4d75a236.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ec82d5ce28b1b5b7c2239fea5f9db04b4d75a236_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1137\u00d7514 48.7 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>Anyway so the answer is yes more coming in the future and yes it is possible now if you search hard enough or create your own.</p>",
