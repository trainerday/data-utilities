I like Joe\u2019s books and have a lot of respect for him, they have a lot of details which gets a bit over whelming but I know some top coaches that also have a lot of respect for Joe.  I know a few others that don\u2019t.  People have been thinking there is new fancy ways to get faster and really there is not, sure top speeds of pro-riders slowly evolve but in the last years everyone said \u201cTrainerRoad\u201d is the way to get faster and now eveyone is saying the classic TrainerRoad plans only work for a minority group of riders\u2026 but definitly year round consistency makes a big difference and indoor training helps with that for most of us.</p>\n<p>I think this book below is both a fun read (more entertaining than Joe\u2019s books) as well as gets you more into the depths of performance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Faster-Michael-Hutchinson-audiobook/dp/B01FGEEII4/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=faster+cycling&amp;qid=1622145287&amp;sr=8-5\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Faster-Michael-Hutchinson-audiobook/dp/B01FGEEII4/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=faster+cycling&amp;qid=1622145287&amp;sr=8-5</a></p>\n<p>I have not read \u201cRide Inside\u201d I just bought it. Thanks for the idea\u2026</p>\n<p>For your goal, just keep riding consistently and make one ride a week slowly longer and longer until you build it up to 5-hours or so (if you can and enjoy it) and you should be doing well.  Just make sure every 3 weeks you take a rest week and cut your volume close to half and do this build up period very slow.  10% a week and then a rest week once a month.  Or learn to use the PMC chart in Intervals.ICU but you should be wearing HRM or have power meter on outdoor.  Again focus on fun, and don\u2019t forget to build recovery in.  Recovery is incredibly important</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Very rarely more than 2 hard days in a row (then take a day off or very easy Zone 1 short ride)</li>\n<li>rest week once a month</li>\n<li>if you are consistent all year you need a yearly rest period too</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sorry you asked for books <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  for more fun reading I like the \u201cBike Snob\u201d series <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">   There are some good cycling science books but pretty deep.  Even though I disagree with many of the ideas in it - Racing and Training with a power meter is a classic.  It definitly has some good stuff but as we are seeing lately trying to equate intensity to time does not really work.  You can\u2019t fully compensate lack of time with increased intensity (but it can work in some cases).</p>",

As of now, my longest ride on trainer is 70 minutes. I will add more time as you suggested. The question I have is: can I take 30 seconds to a minute during the longer time run? My sit-bones hurt and I am trying to get used to it, but still, I have to take a break and adjust. I am not tired, at least as long as I am in the zone 1 and 2 based on heart rate. So, the small break during the training is more for the sit bones than for the lack of energy. Is that allowed when we are training?</p>\n<p>Thanks!<br>\nSai</p>",

I still strongly believe fat adapted can be beneficial and carb intolerance is a problem for most or all overweight people. All I really know is this stuff is seriously complex and the answer is usually \u201cit depends.\u201d  I think training is much simpler than diet <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",
