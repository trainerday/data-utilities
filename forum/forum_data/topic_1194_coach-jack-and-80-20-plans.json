The crunched power is pyramidal and the polarized is on basic form (not enough high intensity work volume).<br>\nWe can of course get by with the custom but I find it really unfortunate that the basic polarized is not polarized at all.

      "cooked": "<p>Hi Fred, actually we are 100% proponents of what we belive the principals definining Polarized Training.  But we would use that to the nature of what Dr. Seiler is describing not \u201cthe numbers.\u201d    If you listen to Dr. Seilers talks for example he says don\u2019t chase numbers.  Anyway.  What he is proposing is more easy rides and less hard rides.  He says 80/20 but he actually contradicts this and even his daughter says she does a Polarized plan from her dad doing 1 hard day followed by 2 easy days.  His studiest are not long duration plans so again I would go with the nature of what he says rather than specifically looking at numbers.</p>\n<p>Our Polarized plan generally will be 1 workout a week with his Zone 3 intervals (3-zone system), this fully follows the nature of Polarized training in my opinion.  When Dr. Seier did this tests he was doing 5-days a week of training.  I have not heard him specifically say it but I bet if we asked him if you train 4 days a week and do 1 hard day he would also constitued that as Polarized.  I think he is talking about people doing 5+ workouts a week.</p>\n<p>So because his study was 9-weeks long that is not enough time to say this is a good training plan for the entire year so we have also build traditional recovery patterns into this \u201cPolarized\u201d plan so we could call that Polarized+</p>\n<p>Secondly if you look at time in zone we are less than Dr. Seilers 90/10 for TIZ \u201cmax limit.\u201d</p>\n<p>You can see the TIZ below it is 12 minutes of the entire week that is in Zone 3 the rest of the week is in Zone 1 (defined by him as below 80% but that is individual).</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/18697ef3ac9488c791ce1c876246558025241b4b.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/18697ef3ac9488c791ce1c876246558025241b4b\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/18697ef3ac9488c791ce1c876246558025241b4b_2_690x194.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"3tXtXwlIkIM4T6oKRwMKESpc2wj\" width=\"690\" height=\"194\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/18697ef3ac9488c791ce1c876246558025241b4b_2_690x194.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/18697ef3ac9488c791ce1c876246558025241b4b.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/18697ef3ac9488c791ce1c876246558025241b4b.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/18697ef3ac9488c791ce1c876246558025241b4b_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">864\u00d7243 39.3 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>If I am wrong here please let me know.  Finally we also add more \u201cold school\u201d practices into polarized by still doing volume / intensity manipulation and progressive overload.

You could try creating some of our custom plans and set your ramp rate to flat and it is possible you might find some thing that has a TIZ focus like you like.

      "cooked": "<p>FWIW: in my opinion, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/alex\">@alex</a> is correct. People are trying to put the Polarized idea into numbers but I don\u2019t think you can do that\u2026<br>\nThe basic idea is really very simple: 1 out of 5 sessions can be hard, the other 4 are easy. To give some idea about easy, VT1 is usualy considered the upper limit. But consider the following situation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are used to do endurance rides of around 2 hours</li>\n<li>You ride endurance for 6 hours: is this still an easy session because intensity is below VT1? No, it\u2019s not! This suddenly became a Hard session.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I believe that hard/easy is defined by the level of recovery you can achieve in 24-36 hours. Because that will decide when you can do another session.<br>\nThe way I see Polarized (and what I understand from many hours of listening to Seiler) is that you should only do one session out of 5 in such a way that you get close to failure. The other 4 sessions should be slightly chalenging, but should feel like you can realy cope with the induced fatigue. Doing things this way, makes sure that you will be able to do the hard session with good quality.<br>\nAnd that hard session isn\u2019t necessarely a VO2max session. Depending on the training phase you\u2019re in, it can just as well be a Treshold or even SweetSpot session. If you make it long enough to be really hard, it IS a hard session.<br>\nTrying to put the above in numbers for intensity targets and/or TID will always fail but it follows the number one rule. I can\u2019t believe that Seiler would want us to do VO2max/Anaerobic stuff during base phase. Rather a very long LIT or a highly chalenging Sweetspot\u2026<br>\nLooking forward to your comments.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Thanks for the clarification\u2026  You would have to send me your plan for me to see but generally if you start at intensity level 1 our plans have very little time in zone 3 and what is there is at the very bottom of Z3. Obviously there is a big difference between 2 minutes at 78% and 10 minutes at 85%.  My guess is if you try these workouts they would feel \u201ceasy,\u201d  and will fall in this definition.</p>\n<p>This workout is the last week of 12 weeks which is when the intensity is at clost to it\u2019s highest.  If you slide up the intensiting knob that increases the TSS as well so will give you more time in Z3 as this is designed to be a progression in terms of tss via both time and intensity.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/3e24ce12b07e38f966edd500b62da28f4a9a15a1.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/3e24ce12b07e38f966edd500b62da28f4a9a15a1\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/3e24ce12b07e38f966edd500b62da28f4a9a15a1_2_690x347.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"8RKsmt53PDshB6bjEc7p9UISMNP\" width=\"690\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/3e24ce12b07e38f966edd500b62da28f4a9a15a1_2_690x347.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/3e24ce12b07e38f966edd500b62da28f4a9a15a1.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/3e24ce12b07e38f966edd500b62da28f4a9a15a1.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/3e24ce12b07e38f966edd500b62da28f4a9a15a1_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">725\u00d7365 28.4 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>Still you are making a vaild point here that I need to consider.
