      "cooked": "<p>Ok so it seems like you have a lot of options on how you can train and one of the key elements is finding something you believe in.  Belief in a plan is 1/2 the battle or more <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>So it seems like you have a few goals here.  Maximize performance for your outdoor season which is in full swing by early April?   And that goal is likely related to aerobic performance more than sprinting performance although sprinting performance makes you feel strong and helps.</p>\n<p>So a fundamental of training is that you build aerobic performance very slowly and anaerobic performance rather quickly.  You can hit an anaerobic peak in about 8 weeks or so, especially if you have a good base.  Because you train very consistently all year incorporating periodization is a good idea but if you are mostly just riding 10-15 hours a week outside vs specific hard training then you have a bit more flexibility as you are less likely to burn out.  Still the main goal for indoor is not to lose any aerobic performance since you can get the aerobic capacity back at the \u201clast moment.\u201d Also since you don\u2019t likely want to or nor should you do more than 10-15 hours a week indoors then holding on is more likely then improving.  Volume is usually the most sure fire way to improve aerobic performance.  If you can try to get one long ride in outdoors each week it can really help.</p>\n<p>So many people go crazy if they drop all anaerobic performance in the winter thinking they are totally out of shape, when in reality they are not.   Many of us here are strong \u201cZone 2\u201d believers but a zone 2 focus is not for everyone.  If you believe me or knew this about anaerobic vs aerobic time lines then doing a pure base period is not so scary.  The long term trend for pros is take the Oct-Dec as base and cross training period.  So this could include a period of spending more time in the gym and less time on the bike.  Really hard gym days take away from your biking training so now could be the time to do that.  So Zone 2 + Gym is not a bad idea and incorporate other kinds of zone 2 or cross training work (I always recommend rucking).   But on the indoor bike that can be watching netflix and pedalling\u2026</p>\n<p>If that does not resonate with you then there are many other options that work.  One day a week of shorter duration VO2max or HIIT combined with suggestions above is also a good idea.</p>\n<p>Generally if you do a super hard fall and winter then you hit your peak around Feb has limited outdoor benefits.  It\u2019s better to peak when outdoor season is in full swing.  You will feel fresher and more excited.</p>\n<p>So anyway tell me if anything resonates here.  You can always do a hybrid approach or do some hard training now and then back off for a mini base period for December and then start ramping up again.  My best friend and partner here is a pro coach for 30 years and he feels pros can benefit by having more fun.  So I would incorporate what sounds fun into your plan at some level.</p>\n<p>One thing about doing zone 2 is you can monitor your HR to power ratio on a weekly basis and watch to see you are not losing aerobic performance. This can significantly help trust as you start feeling out of shape without the higher intensities.</p>",
