      "cooked": "<p>I have downloaded several workouts from TrainerDay and sent them to my Garmin Edge 820 computer as well as a Garmin fenix 5 plus watch.</p>\n<p>Most of the time I just turn on my computer, jump on the bike and ride. Sometimes I used these workouts from TrainerDay. The problem is that my readings from my TrainerDay workouts seem weird to me. Most of them (though not all) are steady effort workouts for 45min - 2 hours. They usually involve a little warmup and a short warmdown, but generally it\u2019s a \u201chold at X power for for 80% of the total time\u201d.</p>\n<p>Usually I cycle at ~29kph, ~90rpm, ~185 power.  The beginning of my workouts line up with that. However, when I look at my speed at the end of the workout, it often says I\u2019m going over 50kph, which simply isn\u2019t possible (for me). Sometimes I\u2019m not even sweating and I\u2019m over 40kph.  <a href=\"https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/recovery-45m\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Here is the workout</a> I was doing.</p>\n<p>I downloaded all my second-by-second data from Garmin and made a graph. The black workouts are the ones were I just ride and watch a show, trying to maintain ~30kph or ~190power.</p>\n<p>The red ones are the designed workouts I downloaded from TrainerDay. I\u2019m still basically in the same speed and range, but as you can see nearly all the workouts just keep saying I\u2019m getting faster and faster.</p>\n<p>My computer was out of battery one time, so I used my watch instead (blue line), also with a TrainerDay workout and it showed better results. However, this workout was severely underpowered and I didn\u2019t break a sweat the entire time.</p>\n<p>One last thing that happens: When I\u2019m doing these TrainerDay workouts and I stop for a moment (refill water bottle, open window, etc.) the resistance on the trainer get\u2019s so strong that I basically cannot restart the cranks. Eventually, with all my body weight, I am able, and after a few rotations it goes back to where it was before I stopped.</p>\n<p>If anyone has suggestions I\u2019m very confused by this.<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/3e5c20e68bf18ba70bd20354b714045b948238ee.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/3e5c20e68bf18ba70bd20354b714045b948238ee\" title=\"Cycling Data\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/3e5c20e68bf18ba70bd20354b714045b948238ee.png\" alt=\"Cycling Data\" data-base62-sha1=\"8TEZempnScniAFF9rJbfRp2Pc6y\" width=\"690\" height=\"475\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/3e5c20e68bf18ba70bd20354b714045b948238ee_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">Cycling Data</span><span class=\"informations\">1170\u00d7807 16.4 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/michael833\">@Michael833</a>,</p>\n<p>I think the speed issue is a bit of a red herring, especially with indoor training. By default your Kickr Core will be transmitting speed data but this speed is based upon the inertia of the flywheel. If you are running your workouts in ERG mode then you can change the flywheel speed through gear changes, this will also change the \u2018feel\u2019 of the workout.<br>\nHonestly I would not worry about the speeds, they are purely an output metric of the session. You are training by power and as such the speed just happens to be what it achievable within that power range.</p>\n<p>As for the lock up of the trainer this could be a result of workouts in ERG mode. If you are running in ERG mode the trainer will hold you at your prescribed wattage.<br>\nPower is a simple equation of force times velocity. You are in control of the velocity side of things in terms of your cadence and the Kickr will handle the force side; the resistance applied. So if you slow your cadence the trainer will increase the resistance to make the same watts.<br>\nIn your case you stop and get off the bike, stopping your cadence. When you get back on it feels locked up preventing you from increasing your cadence to allow the resistance to drop. The best way I have found is to back pedal and trick the trainer into seeing a cadence increase and then knock it forward and get on top of it as soon as you can.</p>\n<p>Hope this help <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\"></p>",

Your responses led me to do more research about ERG mode, testing and setting FTP, etc. I\u2019m feeling like I have a much better understanding now, so thank you.</p>\n<p>Alex, I\u2019ve subscribed, and we will see if this clears things up. Hopefully I\u2019ll know after tonight\u2019s workout.</p>",
