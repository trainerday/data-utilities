      "cooked": "<p>Hi All. Sorry in advance if this is a long post, but I\u2019m looking for some advice on HR and power zones for Zone 2 cycling.</p>\n<p>I am a relatively well-trained cyclist, currently sitting at an FTP of 290w, which puts me at 4.3w/kg. I ride around 6-8 hours a week, mostly indoors. I had been feeling tired and over trained, and some life and work stress which led me to recently taking a week off the bike entirely. This felt great. Also, my wife and I are expecting our first baby in February 2025. With that in mind, I have decided to do only Zone 2 training for a few months to help rid my body of stress ahead of becoming a new dad!</p>\n<p>I researched Maffetone style training which sounded like just what I needed, and although my MAF 180 HR is 146 (180-34 years old) this is actually my heart rate when I\u2019m riding in Sweet Spot, so obviously too high for Zone 2. I researched this specifically for cycling and found that usually this needs to be reduced by 10-15 bpm as cycling tends to produce lower HR numbers than running. I therefore landed on a MAF number of 131, which is more like what I see when in the upper end of my zone 2 power range.</p>\n<p>I created some HR+ workouts using the Maffetone warm up and cooldown, with the main section of the workout in HR+ mode set at 128bpm to keep things under my MAF heart rate. The HR+ system itself is <strong>excellent</strong>, adjusting the erg on my Wattbike really smoothly and gently adapting power to affect my HR.</p>\n<p>I think, however, that my HR zones and power zones are out of whack with each other. For example, to stay at 128bpm, which is lower than even my reduced MAF HR (and the middle of my Coggan Zone 2 HR) I have to ride a bit at tempo (220-230 watts) and/or the very top end of my zone 2 power (around 216 watts). This in itself can be rather demanding on a trainer for 90 minutes, and not the \u201ceasy\u201d riding I expected from this MAF style of training\u2026 <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/rofl.png?v=12\" title=\":rofl:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":rofl:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>\u2026or maybe I\u2019m wrong and I really should be riding at the higher end of my Z2 power?</p>\n<p>My Coggan HR zone (60%-70% of my MAX HR of 188) is 113bpm to 132bpm.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m a bit unsure of how best to approach this. Should I just ride in the middle of Coggan zone, setting HR+ mode to 123 bpm? This would certainly feel easier. Any advice/insight would be much appreciated.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi, so three different ideas.</p>\n<p>High Aerobic Capacity - Intervals<br>\nif you read about Mark Allen\u2019s (5-times Ironman winner) experience and I also had the same, if you are aerobically very strong then these below AeT are not necessarily easy.  So Mark said he started out at high performance level but his aerobic performance was not very good, after doing lots of Maffetone he was eventually doing \u201czone 2\u201d intervals.</p>\n<p>Lower it<br>\nYou don\u2019t need to be at full Maf intensity to gain the benefits, -10 is fine.</p>\n<p>TTer<br>\nOne other guy that used to be here was just like you.  Zone 2 HR was sweet spot power. He actually could do sweet spot power for hours (outdoors anyway).  He had a flat power duration curve meaning he could not sprint very well.  I thought the two might be connected.  The very TTer nature of his power curve and his strong power to HR ratio.</p>\n<p>So if you are idea <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span>, you may be extremely well adapted now and you may see less benefit from it.  Ultimately the goal is supposed be learning to be fat adapted, that you burn fat for fuel.  Can you do long rides fasted?  I personally would lower it -10 and see how that feels, do your rides fasted or without carbs recently before and do the suggested MAF tests and see if you see improvement over a month, if not, this is likely to be less beneficial for you.  Personally I would still do it, but it should not be  so hard, probably closer to zone 2 power.  Meaning having a base period that gives you some rest before moving to harder build and peak periods.  This helps you feel extra fresh for the spring.</p>",

I think I\u2019ll reduce the HR target for now, maybe just by 5pm, and see how my power output changes (if at all) over the next couple of months. I might then look to do the high aerobic capacity intervals as per Mark Allen\u2019s training. I could also look to create some workouts where I\u2019m alternating between HR+ targets at low and high end of Z2 every 5-10 minutes or so?</p>",

Maffetone says it\u2019s better to go too low than too high and -10 is fine based on his suggestions.  You should also validate this 146bpm value is correct by trying talk tests.  It should be very easy to have a conversation, almost no perceptible breadth change over walking.  It\u2019s possible the 180 formula is off for you, it\u2019s also very possible you are very fat adapted.   180 formula is estimating your aerobic threshold (AeT), since this is a physiological state, 180 formula is just an estimate of that turn point.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Thank you, Alex.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/lionelhutz\">@LionelHutz</a>, this in itself is a test. Of course, there are specific tests you can do, but the problem with such a test is that it costs you hours that you can\u2019t train.</p>\n<p>If you learn how to interpret your body\u2019s signal and explain it, you can draw the right conclusions.</p>\n<p>Like Alex said, every body works differently. When you read about research conclusions, you have to understand that they are trying to take an average from these different bodies.<br>\nSometimes, that is easy because the target group is homogenous. In these kinds of studies, the conclusion is worth the most, but only for people who fit the target group.</p>\n<p>You can research this topic (zone hr training) for pro cyclists or even better, top 10 GC riders from the Tour de France. These riders are pretty similar, although I would expect Pogacar to be very different from the rest.<br>\nThe conclusions of this topic would be valuable because the group is homogenous, but only for this group.</p>\n<p>If we would apply the conclusions to every rider using Trainer Day, we would get very different results.</p>\n<p>On Heart rate, I\u2019m in the middle of the middle. <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/face_with_hand_over_mouth.png?v=12\" title=\":face_with_hand_over_mouth:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":face_with_hand_over_mouth:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>I know the pro-rider coaches don\u2019t use it. Heart rate has too many variables that influence it. Heat, hydration, fatigue, time of day, and even clothing or how well you are rested influence it.</p>\n<p>For the short intervals, your heart rate is higher when you are resting than when you are giving it all because there is a 30-second-ish delay in your body\u2019s response.</p>\n<p>Some of these factors are very personal. Power, on the other hand, looks pretty objective.</p>\n<p>I think the missing links in measuring performance are blood sugar and lactate. These two can show you directly what\u2019s happening in the body. However, this would make the outcome of every race very predictable and boring.</p>\n<p>I say power looks objective because it is much less absolute than they want you to believe.</p>\n<p>You can lay down an impressive 4,3 Watt/kg. Your ftp is 290, so you weigh 67kg. Unless you are shorter than 180cm you are the climber type. Would you be able to lay down 290 watts at the end of the Ronde van Vlaanderen (flanders classic) on a very windy day? Probably not. If you are shorter than than 175 I would ask you the same question, but in a mountain race.</p>\n<p>My FTP is 300, but uphill, you would destroy me in the first 20 minutes because I weigh 80 kg.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been tracking heart rate since then late 80\u2019s and back than it was all we had. And it worked just fine. So why not use it now?</p>\n<p>But to fine-tune your performance, like pro cyclists do, you need power (and lactate and blood sugar).</p>\n<p>Long story short, here is my advice: use the heart rate by looking at the training sessions. Look at patterns.</p>\n<p>You are now looking at a bar chart, but the interesting info is not if your heart rate missed the target, but when and how high.</p>\n<p>If that happened at the end? No problem.<br>\nIf you were riding outside and it was on a hill? No problem.<br>\nIf you were eating or drinking? No problem</p>\n<p>Remember that if your heart rate was 130 for 10 minutes, you would have a bar chart like this. Does that mean that you missed your target? Of course not.</p>\n<p>I hope this helps. Just keep on riding. Overall, I think you are making the right choice in your situation.<br>\nAnother question that I think is very valuable is: what kind of schedule did you ride that allowed you to overtrain with 6 hours a week?</p>\n<p>Have fun, Coach Robert</p>",

This was paired with high life stress. I have a fairly high stress full time job, I was also studying a postgraduate degree full time alongside this, with a 6 month pregnant wife with whom I was doing lots of DIY to get the house baby-ready, and a dog who needed two long walks a day. Fitting all of that in and something had to give, which led to me burning out. I got to a nice FTP of 290 at 67kg. Now that I\u2019ve achieved that, I want to just be healthier  - starting by putting on a few KGs - I am 185cm tall - and balancing out the stress in my life.
