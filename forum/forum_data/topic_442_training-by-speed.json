It might open up training to a huge number of people who have basic resistance trainers, interested in getting healthier and riding their bike indoors, but aren\u2019t as committed (or insane) as some of us!</p>\n<p>I think there are a lot of casual users who own trainers but don\u2019t have access to, or care about, power and/or heart rate data. They own simple resistance trainers and aren\u2019t going to invest buckets of money on a smart trainer. The price of Trainer Day could be very appealing to this group of casual users, especially if they could train by speed.</p>\n<p>Setting up a speed sensor is much more affordable and simpler than a power meter. A speed sensor can be left on the bike, and doesn\u2019t require any additional wearables. Just get on the bike and ride.</p>\n<p>If there were an option in Settings to \u201ctrain by speed\u201d with a % that let you control effort, it could be as simple as enabling \u201ctrain by speed\u201d and the app could automatically convert % FTP to MPH (or KPH) as the target. Tweaking the % could adjust the effort.</p>\n<p>Just sharing thoughts there, but I could see this opening up training/casual healthy rides to a large number of users who just have access to a bike, a resistance trainer, and a smartphone.</p>",
