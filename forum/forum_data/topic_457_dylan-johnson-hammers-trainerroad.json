There is also the notition that this is just CTS (biggest Coaching organization in the US) marketing against  TrainerRoad and Zwift marketing.  I actually think that is a valid and likely real point.  There is a lot of real science and even though TR comes from the Coggan belief system which is connected to TP and Joe Friel, they go against many of Joe\u2019s recommendations.</p>",

I feel bad for TR because they\u2019ve done some good in getting people on the bike but it\u2019s good to see that TR forum is generally okay with it. We\u2019ll see about the TR leadership.</p>\n<p>Btw, Dylan Johnson isn\u2019t with CTS anymore as of about 1 year ago.</p>\n<p>Also, I\u2019m not completely sold on the \u201conly polorized\u201d approach that Dylan Johnson says is most effective. Lots of polorized studies are for cross country skiiers and they are not the same sports\u2026 while he is a top athlete, the athletes he coaches don\u2019t really have the results yet to give him a great track record. That\u2019s not to say it doesn\u2019t work. He seems to really like friel which is good for what it is but there\u2019s more to training than Friel and then Seiler try and share. On a different note, even seiler doesn\u2019t follow full polorized training in his own training. I prefer an approach that differs slightly, but obviously z2 and endurance rides prevail.</p>\n<p>San Millan has his athletes train in the higher \u201cgrey zone\u201d that Seiler says to not mess with. It highly depends on the period though, for example base training is more polarized in nature because of higher volume z2 and less intensity. Then as the season and builds progress, the intensity and Threshold need to come into account so it becomes more pyramidal in nature naturally (less super hard days). Then towards the peak period we see a lot of polarized again as the days are either really hard or really easy in the final pre-race period. 1 interval session every 5 days just isn\u2019t enough for most people and Seiler\u2019s own training and programs even show this, as he doesn\u2019t do this year round.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not 100% using this graph but find it helps give a better general idea for a self-coached athlete than doing strictly polarized<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/16ebd8b93983efb910ac4670b5099b9b41410c2c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/16ebd8b93983efb910ac4670b5099b9b41410c2c\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/16ebd8b93983efb910ac4670b5099b9b41410c2c_2_690x306.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"3gLNNV4BEoef9EesXXzot9HPqPO\" width=\"690\" height=\"306\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/16ebd8b93983efb910ac4670b5099b9b41410c2c_2_690x306.jpeg, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/16ebd8b93983efb910ac4670b5099b9b41410c2c_2_1035x459.jpeg 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/16ebd8b93983efb910ac4670b5099b9b41410c2c.jpeg 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/16ebd8b93983efb910ac4670b5099b9b41410c2c_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1046\u00d7465 128 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi Jeremy, actually one thing you have to realize is this is CTS not just Dylan, and this view is predominant at there as well as most of the non-Coggan following, pro-cycling world, so this is not just one kids voice, this is hundreds of years and hundreds of thousands of cyclists being trained at CTS.  I am not anti-coggan, and just like you I appreciate what he, TP and TR have done. It\u2019s just time to move on to modern science and going with what has been proven more effective to date.</p>\n<p>As I am sure you know, Polarized and pyramidal are just modern terms for what the elites and pros have been doing forever so it is very proven at the top levels, definitely less proven at lower levels. At this point the ONLY studies that have been done, show that what works for the pros and elites also works for the 4+ hour a week crowd.  So Dylan\u2019s very valid point is that until shown otherwise there is no reason to try to claim something else is superior. With lack of evidence go with current scientific evidence. If you look at Seiler\u2019s studies some are cyclists as well, he is a cyclist. The main point is do more easy miles. He says Polarized and Pyramidal are similar results and this just means more easy riding, 2 or rarely in some individuals, 3-hard rides a week. According to Selier, true polarized is more like 1-hard interval day per 5 training sessions 80/20). So while you may not agree, the only science we have at this point and as well as the pros, are showing this works. Do you have other studies showing something else?</p>",

The note about seiler was just saying that he himself doesn\u2019t train purely polorized and training is more complex than just 1 set training method for all time and training periods. To say training is as simple as one training methodology would be missing a big picture as well as a whole lot of individuality and ignores what the majority of cyclists do or need to do in order to get to their potential given the time they have.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll possibly try again while on a computer</p>",

I am 100% sure it can improve peoples fitness\u2026 \u201chey my time crunched atheletes are now faster after doing an SS plan it must work\u2026\u201d Look at the TR forums we know it can work for some.</p>\n<p>The point is that new studies have shown that what works for the pros also works for those on a small number of hours. CTL is now more focused on this then they were in the past.  Also, in an A/B test it appears 80/20 beats 60/40. Could 70/30 be best for YOU sure but start at science \u201cproven\u201d of 80/20 and then adjust.</p>\n<p>So the Coggan theory of CTL=Fitness has now been shown inaccurate (one of the strongest argments for SS plans). CTL is not the most important thing to focus on.  Yes, it matters, but which I am sure you agree with only when used in conjunction with the right training / recovery / intensity models.  80/20 gets people thinking differently, not such a CTL / TSS focus.</p>\n<p>The single model of poloarized addresses the biggest problem in the industry, amplified in the last few years by the indoor platforms.  Too much hard training.  The simplest way to help people is to give them a simple formla on how not to do too much.  80/20 addresses that.  If you have a great coach then 80/20 does not need to be the focus, but if you have a tendency to do too much then it is a good place to start.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Jeremy I agree with you that a ramp test can be problematic for sweetspot training and especially if you are trying to precisely follow an ERG based training plan such as TR\u2019s.  This is exagerated if you have more of a sprinter profile.  I also see your point from before, if you are a coach trying to keep your athletes following the same plans then you might need to adjust their FTP (frequently down to a 20-min FTP test intensity).</p>\n<p>Seiler, Friel and Dylan all seem to have the common belief that your training intensity should be more by feel and power/erg just get\u2019s you in the ballpark. This is my belief of what they are saying, I have only heard Seiler say this.   So as a starting point for training working with 8-min intervals at 95% is close enough to ~6-min at 105% for training benefit so you just go to your comforable failure level and just keep increasing it as you get stronger.  So if your FTP is a bit exaggerated it\u2019s not the end of the world you just end a bit earlier.</p>\n<p>As I have stated in many other posts and told to me by my top coach friends the ramp test is superior due to it\u2019s simplisity, repeatability and consistency.  In thousands of lab tests my friend takes the last minute average and multiplies between 70-80% it will almost align with an LT mask test (which is also not 100% accurate).  So to your point many riders should be that 70% mark rather than the 75% that TR and Zwift give them.  I have more of a sprint profile and should use 70% but I like 75% a lot more <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",

Now at 50 year old I have been steadily getting back into cycling again.<br>\nI hated turbo trainers but loved the feel of rollers. TR made the most sense to me. So much concentration required on rollers to stay upright so a simple interface infront of you I felt was best. Now that I have recently invested in smart rollers I have been keen to try the more cgi \u2018smart\u2019 virtual offerings. Up to now it feels like a waste of time\u2026 So, I found Trainer Day which appears to offer exactly what I want again. I\u2019m still trying out rgt, elite real videos etc with erg for the \u2018fun\u2019 novelty but I\u2019m pretty sure TD will be my goto.<br>\nAnyway, ramble/back story aside this discussion caught my attention for a few reasons. Mainly that I never get asked \u2018how do you feel today\u2019 prior to a workout. Surely this makes a huge difference to the ability to endure a workout regardless of which system/theory or metrics used to callibrate efforts.<br>\nWhat I would like to see is a global assesment option that could be applied to my TD account. Once activated and based on ftp (and history) a conditioning excercise for 2/3 minutes will be run prior to whatever training plan is in place, a range of lumps and bumps designed to quickly assess peddaling efficiency at low effort and general \u2018mojo\u2019 followed by a series of questions based on the outcome of the daily conditioning test resulting in some in-app wisdom either the suggestion to lower ftp today, smash it today as you seem to be full of beans or even to tell me I seem to be unstable today why not rest.<br>\nSo\u2026 I guess I\u2019m looking for an intelligent \u2018mojometer\u2019 prior to continuing my daily self training plan.</p>",

I also did a lot less cycling during 90s-2018 or so.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know anyone directly that fully followed the TrainerRoad adaptive training but if you want something that really changes on a daily basis I think TR and Xert are the two primary options.  There are other things like Kudo Coach as well.</p>\n<p>I have a similar opinion of TR plans as Dylan has so their adaptive training is suspect to me but really many people are very happy with TR and seem even more happy with adaptive training so I can\u2019t personally say.  I can say that Coach Jack plans are very different.  I would say CJ plans are \u201cold school\u201d where TR training phylosophy has been focused on maximizing TSS which on one hand makes sense but on the other does not (I could go into detail why I believe this).  Anyway, I can\u2019t say how much better TR adaptive is then their old plans.</p>\n<p>Coach Jack old school actually requires less adaptivity.  Also I think self managment of adaptivity is totally reasonable and approachable.  If you feel like you have a demanding life and need more flexibity rather than using our calendar, push a CJ plan to \u201cMy Plans\u201d and activate it there.  Then it is a sequence of workouts.  Once a sequence of workouts on an off day you can grab another workout from your library, like a recovery ride and just keep working through the sequence to the end.</p>\n<p>CJ workouts start at a very manageble level and you can use our ride feel to further adjust the intensity.</p>\n<p>Anyway I really hope we can live up to your dreams and expectations, we are happy to be a part of your on going success in cycling <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",
