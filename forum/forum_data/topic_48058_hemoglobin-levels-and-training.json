Had 2 iron perfusions (500 ml each) only to discover that 1 month after receiving intravenous iron my hemoglobin levels were, again, very low (10 ish).</p>\n<p>Suggested by one of my doctors, I\u2019ve bough an hemoglobin reader, which I use every morning. I\u2019ve started to discover that my iron levels are high when I don\u2019t train for awhile (one week and I start to present my HB levels at mid 13s), but as soon as I have a training day, next day I feel dizzy and my HB levels drop to 10s again.</p>\n<p>I do have a good meal routine (even if I could do better in that respect)</p>\n<p>Curiously I have what I can assume to be \u201cgood numbers\u201d for my age. I do have a high Vo2 max (since kid that I exercise) and an FTP around 280. My profile is a Puncheur and I\u2019m 54 yo.</p>\n<p>I can have a good performance in a Grand Fondo for my age if I plan to achieve a good HB level for the day, but if I have to make another race the next day, I\u2019ll be shredded like someone had hammered me the day before.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m gathering literature about the subject, and I\u2019ve came accross a scientific paper which relates exercise, low HB and plasma dilution in red blood cells.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m talking to my doctor about it on the next appointment and see what he thinks about it.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, please be free to share your experience if you had some of these drawbacks or if you know someone who had.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot.</p>",

I could ask my Pro coach friend if he has heard anything.</p>\n<p>Not sure if you are a chatGPT user but it is very valuable not as \u201cthe truth.\u201d but as a place to seek ideas and formulate more questions.  It sounds not so uncommon.  I just pasted what you wrote there.  Sorry I know you are looking for more human experience, I was just not sure if you checked this source.</p>\n<p>------ GPT --------</p>\n<p>This experience is relatable, especially in endurance sports, where the demands on the body often reveal underlying physiological limitations. Given your consistently low hemoglobin despite supplementation, the fluctuations you\u2019re seeing could stem from several interconnected factors:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Exercise-Induced Hemodilution</strong>: During intense or prolonged exercise, blood plasma volume tends to increase as an adaptive response to training. This can result in \u201cpseudo-anemia\u201d or sports anemia, where hemoglobin concentration appears low but isn\u2019t necessarily due to iron deficiency or true anemia. This adaptation helps improve oxygen delivery but can temporarily lower measured hemoglobin levels.</li>\n<li><strong>Iron Turnover and Loss</strong>: In endurance athletes, iron loss through sweat, hemolysis (breaking down of red blood cells from repetitive impact, especially if you ride long and hard), and gastrointestinal bleeding (from high-intensity exercise) is higher than in the general population. Even with infusions, it seems your iron demands might exceed supply, especially under heavy training loads.</li>\n<li><strong>Individual Absorption and Utilization</strong>: Some people don\u2019t absorb or utilize iron efficiently, even with diet or supplementation. This can be due to genetic factors, underlying inflammation, or gastrointestinal factors that impair iron absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Impact of Age</strong>: At 54, recovery and iron metabolism can be less efficient than in younger years. Age-related changes in the bone marrow\u2019s ability to produce red blood cells or shifts in hormones (like EPO) that stimulate red cell production can affect your hemoglobin response post-training.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your plan to consult with your doctor about exercise-induced anemia and hemodilution is excellent, as they might consider additional tests like ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein to better understand your iron status and any underlying inflammation. Additionally, tracking more metrics over time may help your doctors fine-tune your treatment.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi Snaavt,</p>\n<p>I know a thing or two about iron. I am a hemochromatosis patient. That means my body absorbs all (and thus to much) iron. I have to donate blood to lower my iron levels. Hemoglobine is therefor never an issue for me.</p>\n<p>If you would join me, we could make a perfect pair. <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=12\" title=\":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>Since donating blood means losing fitness, I do everything I can to avoid iron. I train hard to destroy red blood cells, I became a vegetarian, I avoid heaps of vitamin C when I\u2019m eating meals that contain iron, and I drink black tea and use a lot of turmeric, which restricts iron uptake.</p>\n<p>The older we get, the more inefficient our body gets in dealing with nutrition.</p>\n<p>As a dietician, my first question is: are you sure you are eating enough iron?<br>\nI would look for any combinations that I mentioned above and reverse them. So, if you are drinking a lot of black tea, stop doing that. If you like Indian food, eat less. Use vitamin C to stimulate iron uptake. I\u2019m not referring to supplementation but to whole foods. Eat a lot of veggies. I teach my athletes to eat but to combine different foods.</p>\n<p>Use more bell papers, eat your meat, and eat a lot of veggies. I teach my athletes to eat three kinds of veggies for each meal.</p>\n<p>On the training side, you need to take a look at how intense you are training. I\u2019m a puncheur too. I know the type. We like to hit(t) it. <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/sunglasses.png?v=12\" title=\":sunglasses:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":sunglasses:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>But, considering our age (turning 50 in January), we need to adapt to a different style of training. Take it easy. You don\u2019t have to bury yourself.</p>\n<p>Long hours, weight training and running will push your iron levels down, a lot.</p>\n<p>Here is my advice: start a nutrition diary. Do this for one or two weeks. Use one that shows you vitamins and minerals as well. Yes, this takes up some time, but you need it.<br>\nTrain 4 weeks with a different approach. Try not to bury yourself in any training, but do short hit sessions with the high intensity limited to  10 minutes or even less. No more than once a week.<br>\nThe rest of your training is zone 2.</p>\n<p>After four weeks, check your fitness. If it is still the same, you will see that less effort doesn\u2019t hurt.</p>\n<p>Good luck and have fun, Coach Robert</p>",
