      "cooked": "<p>Excellent question.  I have been studying this for the last 10 years or so.  There for sure bigger experts than me, just I know a bit about this.  I think the main source of confusion comes from different people being different.  So theoretically if you are training and your HR/avg power is increasing then you are achieving the primary goal and the rest does not matter.  But there are many values that can be achieved from \u201czone 2.\u201d  First let\u2019s be clear \u201cZone 2\u201d is not Zone 2, just a nice name for it.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits or potential desired benefits of \"Zone 2\"</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Aerobic improvement<br>\na) Improves mitochondria</li>\n<li>Become a much better fat burner</li>\n<li>Minimum stress on the body (allows more training)</li>\n<li>Improved health (longer discussion)</li>\n<li>A solid part of periodization that improves seasonal gains, giving a rest period</li>\n<li>A solid base allowing more intensity with less risk and downsides</li>\n<li>Improves work capacity (the amount of effort you can do in a week)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So when talking about this \u201cZone 2\u201d you have to understand which of these benefits you are shooting for.  Most people are thinking primarily about <span class=\"hashtag\">#1</span>.  In this case it\u2019s possible you could do sweet spot or threshold workouts and see benefits, even vo2max might show improvement in HR/power\u2026</p>\n<p>Now the down side is at these higher intensities the aerobic improvement will likely end much sooner and result in a lower maximum benefit.  If you nail your Zone 2 right you may see continued improvement for a long period of time.  If you do zone 2 for a long time eventually you could get to the point that you can do sweet spot power zone at closer to a zone 2 heart rate so you can go fast for a very long time with little pain.</p>\n<p><strong>I would argue <span class=\"hashtag\">#2</span> might be the biggest benefit and bring all the other benefits with it.</strong></p>\n<p>So all that said I did not really answer your question <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">    I will slightly answer your question now and answer it in more detail later.</p>\n<p>Most experts like to associated this Zone 2 limit with AeT (aerobic threshold).  That can be 65% in some people and might be 82% in others (I am not sure the maximum).  So 82% has nothing to do with zone 2 heart rate.  Seilers 3 zone model in this case is a better definition and let\u2019s call it upper zone 1.  Zone 2 is a convenient and now \u201cstandardized\u201d name and roughly equates to where you should be training.</p>\n<p>So when hearing the experts talking there is a disagreement of what AeT feels like or how to measure it outside the lab.  I believe this is because it feels very different in a pro or elite vs a beginner.  Maffetone was the first one to really bring low heart rate \u201czone 2\u201d to the mainstream.</p>\n<p>Maffetone mostly had runners and triathletes, and that is who mostly got excited about it, because they become desprate for a solution to their over training problems (less of a problem in cycling).   Still I and many others believe Maffetone is still THE EXPERT when it comes to understanding average people (as well as top endurance athletes), in regards to low heart rate training.  Low HR training gets a bad name because it sounds so slow, Zone 2 sounds a little faster and less scary <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>So Maffetone has had hundreds of thousands of followers using or that used his program and I would guess 90% see the benefits (following all his groups for a long time).  His HR limit is based on the 180 formula.  You can google it Maffetone 180.  For most people it seems to come around 65% of max HR but you could just use his foruma as long as you are not approaching or over 65 years old, where his formula stops working.</p>\n<p>The main point Maffetone makes is that it is better to start on the low side of your AeT rather than risk it by going over.  Going over can slow progress drastically.  Being under your limit seems to have no negatives other than you have to run/ride so dam slow in the beginning, uphill you might even have to walk or get passed by the walkers\u2026 slight exaggeration.   Finding a good route or doing z2 indoors makes it much easier.</p>\n<p>Anyway that\u2019s a quick summary.  I will try to respond in more detail <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>San Milan, Peter Attia and Seiler seem to set the limit based on how you can talk but I think they are using themselves or serious athletes and so their talk test might be higher than the average person.  They set it based on when you can talk but are slightly struggling but you can still have a continuous conversation but if you were on the phone people would notice you are exercising.  For me and based on Maffetone\u2019s limit\u2019s it\u2019s lower than this.  I believe it is closer to when you first start to feel breathing feel more intense than an easy walk but talking is still unobstructed.</p>\n<p>Ultimately I would say it\u2019s important to know your self.  For most people when they first start 65% or even 68% of max HR and strictly staying under it, it\u2019s painfully slow except in optimum conditions.  After a few months it\u2019s much faster but those first few months are hard.  So if you can\u2019t handle this.  Doing it indoors is much easier (with big fans and practicing deep breathing).  Otherwise outdoors you might need to try these higher intensity levels and see if they work for you.</p>\n<p>Overt a period of time I would think your AeT improves although based on Maffetone\u2019s calculations he believes that takes a few years and gives about a 5 beat improvement. But this 5 beats combined with being faster at a low heart rate could give you up to 50% more power at an easy pace or more. (Just a guess).</p>",

Meaning it should not require much recovery.  HRV monitoring should indicate you are are not digging any holes even after back to back days unless they are really long or you are noticably increasing your volume you might see a small hit.</p>\n<p>If you are not seeing consistent monthly progress then I would reduce your target HR and focus on pre-ride food and getting enough sleep.</p>\n<p>Generally I think 65%-75% is probably the normal AeT for most, if you have been consistent for a long time doing a reasonable # of hours per week then 75% might be closer to your actual AeT.</p>",

I did buy an SMO2 meter which works for some people, it clearly shows my defection point exactly where my breadth estimated AeT is which is where Maffetone\u2019s 180 formula puts me.   He says his formula is not good for 65+ years old.  For me this is the place where breathing just barely starts changing, which is not the same as what I consider right before heavy breathing. It\u2019s like the very bottom of a change between zero breathing and some breathing.  It\u2019s less than Peter Attia would suggest that you would notice I was exercising if I was on the phone.   Also there is zero risk from Maffetone\u2019s perspective of being slightly on the too low side of things.</p>\n<p>I also agree with Dave, it\u2019s the no-stress point.</p>",
