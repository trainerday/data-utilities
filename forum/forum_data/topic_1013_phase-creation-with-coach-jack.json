I am very excited and next Monday I will start to test it with the BASE phase.</p>\n<p>I created a base plan with Serious Italian for 12 weeks, which fits perfectly with my Schedule and my capabilities. I have a question and it is the following:</p>\n<p>Suppose I carry out all 12 weeks of the Serious Italian Base plan,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\u00bfhow do I create the Buil phase afterwards?</li>\n<li>\u00bfIs it possible to create the entire season with all its phases?</li>\n<li>\u00bfHow does Coach Jack know that the phase I need and the one I am creating is Base, or Build or Peak or race?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Congratulations on this idea and good product. Greetings from Colombia.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hello, Andres from Columbia.  I am happy to see South American\u2019s here it is great!!! <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>We are working on adding multiple blocks (phases) now.  The Italian is not what I or most people would consider a base phase although it starts mild enough that many people might feel the first 4-weeks are easy.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a complicated question to answer because most indoor riders want higher intensity indoors but from a periodization stand point that is not the best.  I would say you could do the first 8-weeks of Italian if you want followed by 4 weeks of true base using Base or Base+ (get a little rest) and then do a 12-16 week build block also with the Italian but start at intensity level 6 and set your ramp rate to 5 or 6 ideally.  Then follow with a peak block of 4-8 weeks.  We are going to add peak blocks soon that match individual goals.</p>\n<p>Right now Jack does not know the current phase you need, but if he recommened a base plan to you that is because you are either injured or not riding much lately and it would be better to start with base or base+ then start the Italian.  It\u2019s much better to think long term than short term but it is also hard in modern society where we want results fast.</p>\n<p>Again thank you for the compliments and glad to have you.</p>",
