While I am a proponent of pure Maffetone for a base period are many variants of Maffetone that will be useful after this base period.  I think this thread will provide some insights.  Maffetone, Zone 2 and Polarized all have similar aspects of training.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/t/gcn-dive-into-zone-2/\">https://forums.trainerday.com/t/gcn-dive-into-zone-2/</a></p>\n<p>If you are following pure Maffetone, you really only need 1 workout and and our + - button and watch your heart rate.  I am really happy to discuss anything you want related to this.</p>\n<p>My personal experience with over-training in running, got me to Maffetone.  I think you can learn a ton but doing pure base under your aerobic threshold.  AeT (around 65-70% of HR usually) Even though Maffetone formula is based on age, and people think that is wrong.  It was very accurate for me and most other people I have heard of.   But strickly following maffetone and taking his MAF tests are ideal but a bit hard to do outdoors on a bike unless you have a perfect enviornment.  Indoor, it\u2019s optimium for MAF tests.  I also suggest his pre-workout dietary suggestions and long warmups.</p>",

Maffetone was a much needed eye opener for me as I was most likely headed down that deep hole as well. I saw that you were a fan (been glancing at the forum).   So the easiest way would be to create one workout with some long warmup and basically a flat line at whatever percentage ftp gets me to target hr rate? Would I need to create a different workout if I wanted to ride for a longer period?   I\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around the dietary suggestions, I am still drinking the kool aid but much much less!</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Yes, on how to create the workout.  The thing is your HR to power ratio changes on a day to day basis so each day you would need to do small adjustments to power to keep it right at your HR limit.  The easier way is way is let\u2019s say 63% is your target power to exactly hit 150 bpm HR TODAY after 15 minute warmup.  Just set it to 60% and hit under that 150 bpm most days.  Also you can also watch your cardiac drift.  When you become a good fat burner and you are under AeT it should be zero or might even be negative.  In that power stays constant HR stays constant or goes down.  Or HR stays constant and power goes up or stays constant.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I went full bore on Maffetone for about 2-years but really I think it is great from a learning perspective but I don\u2019t think it is 100% necessary from a training perspective, meaning maybe it is something you do once for 3-6 months, understand it then you can vary the program to make it more variable and more fun <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">   If you are in the close to burned out phase now, maybe take 1-2 weeks completely off (to be super safe) then do pure zone 2 for 2 months at the minimum and then you can start to do a Coach Jack build plan for example Serious Italian and if you still want to focus on fat burning you can put the zone 2 work in the beginning.</p>\n<p>If you want more ideas on any of this, as I said I am happy to share.  Generally a yearly 2-month base zone 2 phase is usually enough to get that aerobic engine working especially if you can put in some bigger hours but many people can see benefit doing it longer.  Also you can do rucking, fast walking, yard work, and all kinds of other activities to get in that Z2 work since it is really heart/fat focused.</p>",

Norwegian university of science and technology (NTMU) reports:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The traditional formula for determining HRmax is \u201c220 minus age\u201d, but can underestimate HRmax by up to 40 beats per minute in seniors. In fact, the method is inaccurate already at an age of 30\u201340 years, and gets more inaccurate the older you are.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>After quite big study (3320 healthy adults) they propose this: \u201c211 - 0.64*age\u201d.</strong> So far, so good. In my case I should have HRmax of about 164 BPM. My AeT (70%) would be 114 BMP.  Really, I think, I would fall asleep at that pace.</p>\n<p>I can use my Elite TUO with TranerDay going on steady effort (breathing by nose), keeping that pace of about 140 - 145 BMP.  Alas it would mean that my HRmax is about 200 BMP (140 / 0.7).  Perhaps something is wrong with me, but that fat burning phase of exercise is really no problem in my case.</p>\n<p>It is also true, that I\u2019m on \u2018ketogenic\u2019 diet for last 21 years and I remember that I stopped to run (middle distance cross country), loosing all pleasure of endurance workouts for about 4-5 years. Instead, I went back to dynamic sports like volleyball, uni hockey, rollers.</p>\n<p>Later on I restarted running / cycleing for pleasure only, but keeping it under 1-2 hours. These days I try to prepare for sprint triathlon (would be a modest start, only age category is not so modest: \u2018hyper-veterans\u2019) and perhaps move to somewhat longer distances. Thank you Alex, for your blog and kind advices, I understand that I need simply a modified \u2018Maffetone\u2019, as the original one<br>\nwould not fit me.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Yes being Keto likely makes you a good fat burner.  If you read Maffetone, a few other signs are that you could go out on a 3 to 4-hour run (ride) fasted and not take any food with you and feel/do ok.  I used to go about 2.5 no problem but never ran farther than that.</p>\n<p>As that last video points out that nose breathing is not necessarily a good indicator of aerobic threshold, talking with close to zero effort is likely better.  Also you may not be 70% of max HR as your aerobic threshold.  Some people can be as high as 80% is my understanding.  Secondly Maffetone clearly says his formula does not work for people over 65, and I guess as you approach 65 it likely gets less and less accurate.</p>\n<p>One more interesting point is that Mark Allen 7-times Hawaian Iron Man winner was one of Maffetone\u2019s students.  When he started the Maffetone method he partially had to walk to keep under this, and after a year or two of practice, he was running so fast in zone 2 that he was doing zone 2 intervals as they were tiring.  My personal experience matches this (almost).  Meaning when I started, I had to run / walk to keep under 140 bpm (my max was 187) and after 2-years of mostly follwing it I could run steady state for 30-minutes under 100 bpm (very slowly) but I could not run the slowest possible at 140 when I started.  I would say I got close to the point that the upper end of z2 felt fast.</p>\n<p>My good friend and partner coached pros for 30-years.  He said for pros zone 2 is not easy at all.</p>\n<p>The best way to determine your AeT is a lab test followed by a talking test.  And talking with someone else in longer conversation, not yourself <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>The point I tried to state above is that Maffetone suggests if you go too high you risk not making the gains you would.  If your Maf test is not improving month after month, try lowering it.  I think in the GCN video they are saying too high based on what Maffetone suggests.  Below is my understanding of Maffetone limits vs GCN suggestion.  Realize I have read all of his books, most multiple times and was a big contributor to a forum for years.

Bottom line is that Rick proposes 80 - 95 % of training in his zone 2 (around 80% of your MaxHR) and kind of long intervals (in uncomfortable zone 5), in remaining time, up to 20%, but mostly in swimming.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, when I go for a short cross-country run (it\u2019s hilly here), after 50-60 minutes I\u2019m back and a bit frustrated, as I had 130 - 150 HR, but near \u2018dry\u2019 (little sweating).

From what I remember Maffetone always associates strong aerobic engine and fat burning together.  So in your case you are seriously fat adapted but in this case how does this relate to your aerobic improvement potential.   This is interesting, and totally out of my knowledge area.  There is large FB group that I have not paid attention to in a long time but I can assume these days there are many keto maffetone runners and possibly cyclists there.  They would likely provide insights if they also see the same benefits.</p>\n<p>I will read through that group and see if I see any common trends there.  As I said I would be very interested to think of what you find.  I have one friend that is a keto guy for a few years, never heard of a long term keto athlete like yourself.  From my understanding you might have a reduced W\u2019 or AWS (anerobic work capacity) just do to the reduced amount of glycogen available but at 75 you are likely already reduced in this so you are likely to be more of a TTer or flatter power duration curve.  I don\u2019t see this as an problem, it\u2019s just you perform your best on long steady state.  This is a generalization.  I don\u2019t know if this is the case with you.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Great Alex,</p>\n<p>I finished that small Maffetone booklet with smile. I could write 95% similar one if not afraid of economic collapse of society. Being on (moderate) keto for 20+ years I used no supplements, vitamins, thousands of processed food items from supermarkets and no doctors.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not surprised that people around me do not believe in what I\u2019m doing (until they lose tennis match). While starting +21 years ago, I\u2019ve re-read 3 times the book, spent 2 weeks with MedLine for confirmations and argued with my last doctor (\u201cdo not try this!\u201d). Breaking with those alimentary habits was like a bungee jump: seemingly impossible feat.</p>\n<p>Concerning AWS, I need it in other dynamic sports (tennis, for instance). I try to keep it by short, explosive exercises, like 50 - 80 pumps, legs on chair, around 70 pumps per minut. AWS may need more of my attention as I tend to stick to exercises I think necessary for a sport (with age you will loose speed, so try to prevent it), but more general AWS would be better.</p>\n<p>Maffetone nutrition part is not really declaring that it is \u2018some keto\u2019. In my opinion it looks complicated, but with time I possibly over-simplified it. You need \u2018inverted piramid\u2019 to official one: fat is the base for energy, some proteins in the middle of that piramid for rebuilding tissue. Now carbohydrates on top (in grams matching your weighs in kg, +10-20%). Craving will stop in few days (if not, add fats). If morning cramps appear in your calves (and lack of magnesium is not the culprit), add some carbs. KISS (Keep it Simple, of course).</p>\n<p>Restrictions relate only to processed food, anything else in moderation, whatever you like (no list of products).</p>\n<p>Soon, I will prepare some tests, run 5K over the weekend, check the pace of slow erg cycling, etc. Today we were making new PR in swimming, I\u2019m back to butterfly: really strange feeling.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m glad I can share my experiences with you, as it looks you may be already convinced,  but waiting on gentle \u2018stroke\u2019.</p>",

Sugar/HFCS being at the top of that list.</p>\n<p>Sounds like you have something really working for you, and might be better than what I am doing but I just could never pull that off consistently and did not enjoy it, except for brief periods.</p>",
