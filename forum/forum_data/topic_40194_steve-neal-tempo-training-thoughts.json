      "cooked": "<p>Hi Dave, Coach Robert here.</p>\n<p>First of all, what a great video. Thank you for sharing. There is a lot of good info in here.<br>\nHe makes the best point that all riders are different. They have different capabilities and, therefore, different strengths and weaknesses. This thinking leads to a different approach in training individual cyclists.</p>\n<p>Your problem is that you fade in in the 3rd/ 4th hour of your rides. As you heard in the video, this can happen for a number of reasons. Maybe your breathing gets shallower which means your body can\u2019t provide enough oxygen anymore. Maybe you are just low on carbs, so your body doesn\u2019t have the energy anymore. Finally, maybe your tempo is too high to begin with.</p>\n<p>The last one is easy to check: review your last rides and check your power. If you ride at or close to Powerzone 4 for more than one hour, you are demanding more than your body can handle.</p>\n<p>Next, check how many carbs you are eating. Not just during your ride but also during the week. If you are on a low-carb diet, this is all you can do. You need a balanced diet with fat, protein, and carbs. High-quality food with lots of fibers, vitamins, and minerals. Think natural food. No packages.</p>\n<p>It also depends on your base. Did you start riding (or even training) last year, or have you been training all your life? Do you focus on the intervals, or do you have a balance with a good aerobic base?</p>\n<p>A good aerobic base means that you spend most of your time at your aerobic threshold on low-speed, easy rides.</p>\n<p>Finally, check your breathing and your body when you are in your 3rd/4th hour. Are you still relaxed? Or are your jaws jammed together and your shoulders near your ears in an effort to keep ramping up the power?</p>\n<p>Take some time to go over these points. Correct them if you need to.</p>\n<p>Now, back to your intervals. There are a lot of ways you can do these intervals. The whole principle of intervals is that you break things down into smaller portions so the body can adjust in steps that will give you more progress in a way that the body can handle better.</p>\n<p>So, instead of starting with the 2x 20, you can also start with 3x 15. Please note that this will be easier to finish and give you 5 minutes of extra time in zone. You could also start with 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Just keep the intervals steady. There is really no advantage in doing the second interval at 82%. However, there is a big downside: You burn out before you can finish it.</p>\n<p>My point is that if you are seeing the right effect (80% FTP at 81% of max HR) in your first interval, then you are close enough.</p>\n<p>It is not an exact science, meaning that the 83% HRmax might be 81% in your body. HR is also influenced by many other factors, like fluids in the body, room or outside temperature, what options for cooling the body are you using, etc.</p>\n<p>My last piece of advice is to mix your intervals up. So make this one of your intervals for the next four weeks, but choose another one in another zone together. Just as with food, variation is key, and it will help you grow as a cyclist.</p>\n<p>Keep watching these kind of video\u2019s. Did you know that Alex posts videos on yo tube too!? Great way to get better.</p>\n<p>Have lots of fun</p>",

I am 5\u201910\", ate whatever I wanted including a lot of junk, and weighed about 190 lbs.  I got into cycling that summer, still ate the same junk, and stayed about the same weight.</p>\n<p>I went low carb January 2021 eating mostly whole foods and have lost weight, normally now I am in the low 150 lb range.  I\u2019m still low carb today, not for cycling performance reasons but because it is better for my overall lifestyle and happiness.</p>\n<p>I rode 3,055 miles in 2022 and 3,610 miles in 2023, so not a large workload, but ok for a working guy.</p>\n<p>It is possible the diet is holding me back on the longer rides, but I\u2019m skeptical as I\u2019m not experiencing bonking symptoms, I think my limiter is muscular endurance.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been working on longer weekend rides this year.  Last Sunday I rode 42 miles on a reasonably windy day.  This ride was difficult enough that I didn\u2019t sleep great that night.

      "cooked": "<p>First of all Dave, Great work on improving your fitness so much.</p>\n<p>Of course you can ride on a low carb diet. But for the higher intensities you definetly need carbs. There is not a pro in the peloton that rides and wins races on a low carb diet.</p>\n<p>Zone 2 is usually not a problem. Zone 3 is the zone where you can eat what you burn, but at he intensity of zone 4 you are burning carbs at a rate that is bigger than you can fuel them.</p>\n<p>It is like the coach in your video said: you can do lower intensities all day, and that is fine for triatlon, but in a road rae you\u2019ll get dropped on the first climb.</p>\n<p>There is so much scientific evidence backing up carbs in your diet as long as you choose the right sources at the right times:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can train more intense</li>\n<li>You recover faster</li>\n<li>You can ride faster for a longer period</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But don\u2019t focus to much on the carbs. It was only one of the possibilities I gave you. And in the end there is no point in debating this. If you really want to know if something works: try it, test it, and draw your own conclusions.</p>\n<p>This works both ways. Even if it works you can still choose not to use it because you don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. Quitting your job and riding 4 hours a day will definetly make you better, but is it worth it? Probably not. <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>I see you are using intervals.icu, good. If you want ot know more about your ride, you better look at the ride itself. This doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. It is far more interesting to see when and where you put certain power into your ride than just the power.</p>\n<p>For instance, you rode an hour in zone 1. Was that at the beginning as a warm up or the last hour because it was the only pace you ould get home with? Or was this devided over downhill sections after three climbs you did?</p>\n<p>Those are three different stories. I could take a look if you want me too. I\u2019ll help you indentify why you fatigue after 3-4 hours. You can either post your ride here or find me there as Robert van der Wulp.</p>\n<p>have a great weekend.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Thank you for sharing. This was a hard ride. You spend almost the whole ride in zone 3 with regular spikes in zones 4, 5, and 6.</p>\n<p>If my profile would look like this, I would feel tired, too. The main goal of this ride isn\u2019t improving your aerobic fitness. It improves muscular endurance.</p>\n<p>I hardly do these rides. Maybe once or twice a month. Most of the time, I ride slower or much harder. Now, that is easy for me to say because I don\u2019t live in a hilly area like you do. I can ride 100km with 10 altitude meters. <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/joy.png?v=12\" title=\":joy:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":joy:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>So, in the end, I think the feeling of being spent at the end of this ride is not out of the ordinary.</p>\n<p>It is always good to know why you are doing certain training. Your body has a double engine. Actually, it is a triple one, but we are not aiming for sprints as endurance athletes.</p>\n<p>There is the engine that runs on fat. Your body has so much fat stored that you won\u2019t be able to empty this storage, even if you wanted. This will provide you with energy forever, but the process of burning fat is complex, so the delivery is slow, and so is your pace.</p>\n<p>The other engine runs on carbs. The delivery of energy from carbs is fast, which is why it can unleash great power. However, the storage is very limited, so you will run out in 1 to 3 hours, depending on your pace.</p>\n<p>It is important to know that no matter what pace you are riding at, there is always a mix between these two.</p>\n<p>Riding slow will provide you with a lot of benefits that will enhance both engines, but especially the fat engine. Riding fast will enhance the carb engine.</p>\n<p>Last thing that is important to understand is that lactate is always formed, even at slow speeds (or no speeds). But when lactate levels rise they, because you attacked a climb, it will take the body 20-45 minutes to get back in the slow-mode were zone 2 training will be beneficial.</p>\n<p>So, if you ride with friends, and you take turns riding up front of your group 10 minutes of zone 4 every hour, you will almost eliminate your 50 minutes of zone 2 training, because your body is using that lactate as a source of energy instead of fat.</p>\n<p>That is why polarised training is so popular. It divides your training and addresses the right zone at the right time.</p>\n<p>Does this mean you shouldn\u2019t do the intervals you set out to do? No, absolutely not. Training is a fun way to discover and there is not one solution.</p>\n<p>So, in the end, I think you have the right to be tired at the end of the ride you did. <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><br>\nI would suggest to aim for 60-90 grams of carbs per hour. That will make rides like these a lot more comfortable, and you will recover a lot faster.</p>\n<p>Remember: carbs are not the enemy. Low-quality food and poor planning are. A good alternative for low carb is intermitted fasting. This way, you can still benefit from the ketones, but also get the carbs in. A 16-8 or 18-6 will do. Meaning you fast for 16-18 hours and eat in 6-8 hours.</p>\n<p>I use this most of the time. I only skip this routine when I train in the evening. <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>Take four weeks to do the training and start with smaller intervals. Work your way up to 3x20.</p>\n<p>Do not change anything else. That way you can properly monitor the result. This goes for food and training. One thing at a time. See where you stand in four weeks.</p>\n<p>Have a great weekend</p>",

I would say after you are warmed up instead of testing FTP you could also compare a consistent effort for HR vs power and you should see hr dropping relative to doing the same power if you are improving your aerobic capabilities.  That way you don\u2019t need to suffer through a test and can still monitor improvement.  You might just be getting a mental improvement but I would guess you are actually improving.  It\u2019s not so different from the sweet spot training which many people do get benefits from but I just see that as a temporary period, for example you could have an easy base, this Neal tempo for build and then transition into more variety and anaerobic during a peak period unless your goal is TT performance.</p>",

If you start easy but just keep increasing the durations of your intervals gradually you will see adaptions but they will be more invisible and minimally or even not painful but from the beginning to the end of the plan you will feel different.</p>\n<p>Secondly something important is how you feel at the beginning of your peak season which for most people is now.  If you do sustained discomfort you end up feeling tired and possibly burned out.</p>\n<p>Yes obviously riding more helps.  I am of the belief lots of short sessions even helps so multiple 30-45 minute sessions a day can really help but that requires more complicated planning to make sure you are getting the right recovery.  One long ride a week can be enough to augment the short sessions, 90% of them could be z2hr.  I would say there is very limited information regarding the effectiveness of this but I have read about lots of one off cases that people feels this helped them to get more weekly volume and better results.</p>\n<p>I think even 6-7 hours a week is fine but it could be your limiter.  There are a million opinions on this stuff, and each situation is different.  If it is working for you and you are happy then it\u2019s fine.  It sounds as though you felt you had peaked in your abilities so that means at that point you typically will see seasonal improvements not consistent improvements.  So your current plan might work for X number of weeks and then you need to shift up your plan anyway.  If you get tired of suffering Robert is a very affordable coach and he can likely help you. But he will also give free suggestions here as well.  I personally have zero interest in un-fun suffering so I always try to find a fun version.

As I said I would also benefit from this suffering but would just try to be patient and minimize the suffering so it\u2019s more by feel, just suffering a little each day and assume you can increase the intervals a minute each day for example.  Just trying to provide an alternative but we each do what we do.</p>\n<p>I am just returning to regular cycling after years of good/mostly valid excuses. So I am doing 7 days a week of 45-85 minutes a day, + 1 long ride a week. But keeping the intensity very low. So my plan is very non-traditional. Once I get through the base period I will start adding intervals with fun focused suffering.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>First of all, let me compliment you with your persisntance. You say you lack mental toughness. I say, you are doing great. These rides are always hard and you are sticking with it.</p>\n<p>The fun thing about endurance is that clients always start with small goals. They want to finish 50km. Than 80km, 100km, 120km, etc.</p>\n<p>They grow into this. The reason why I\u2019m not a big fan of long hard trainings is that they are the opposite of this approach. It makes it very hard to complete schedules like this, unless you love to suffer.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, a group approach can help.</p>\n<p>The other donwside, besides draining you mentally, is that these intervals bring you to the edge of overtraining. They are very hard on the body. Not just physiologically, but also physically.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of studies that have proven the effect of shorter intervals. The main benefit of shorter intervals is that you can keep up the intensity higher for that short period of time and therefore do more than during the same time under pressure with longer intervals.</p>\n<p>I train all my clients with a polarised training. I give them a little bit of freedom so they can also do rides they like. This gives them an optimal trainingload, both physically and mentally.</p>\n<p>As Alex said, right now I\u2019m on vacation. This gives me more time to do extra training, but since I\u2019m in hte mountains I want to ride the big ones too. So my trainingload is bigger than it should be, but the fun is there and that makes it okee.</p>\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t do this when I\u2019m home. Than it is back to polarised schedules and a wilde ride accasionally.</p>\n<p>I hope this gives you some new ideas.</p>\n<p>And don\u2019t forget to have fun</p>",

We suggest you start some where that feels moderate to easy and slowly increase and by the end of a training block should feel moderate to hard.   When you start by 2X20 even if it is upper tempo you don\u2019t have far to go or your won\u2019t progress very quickly.  If you start with a 2X8 and build to a 2X20 or even a 2X30 then you are likely going to feel fine along your journey.</p>\n<p>Roberts suggests are always so down to earth and backed with a lot of experience is why I love them <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",
