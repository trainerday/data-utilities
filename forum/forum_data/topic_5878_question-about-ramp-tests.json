I completed the ramp test, just struggled to hold 300w at the end for a minute but I did. Anyway, it didn\u2019t \u2018spit out\u2019 a number like I was expecting. The average power of the ride was 156w but surely that\u2019s just dependent on what I set in the first place, i.e. if I\u2019d set 225w as the FTP it would have given me a ramp with bigger numbers which I may or may not have met?</p>\n<p>What I\u2019m saying is I don\u2019t know exactly what my FTP is, this could be improved in the app for new users (just make it easier to understand please)</p>\n<p>Cheers</p>\n<p>Joe</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi Joe, yes the problem is people like you are too strong and first FTP test is off.  I just added more steps to reduce the chance of this happening (we should automatically add steps if you get to the end to stop this from happening).  If you were at your end at 300 or could do one more step maybe then it sounds like your ftp is about 225 (75% of 300).  I know this is not fun, but if you want to be sure you could do one more test starting with 225 as your FTP but you can probably guess close enough how much farther you could have gone.  Personally I don\u2019t go to complete failure but close, I just make sure each time it is that same level of effort (RPE) at the end.</p>",

Sounds like 225w is close enough (within 5%) to work from for the first block going forward. I had a quick search of training plans for FTP building but couldn\u2019t find one I liked so I spent a little while making a new plan (GREAT tool btw) based on a previous one I\u2019d used <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>Thanks again,</p>\n<p>Joe</p>",

Trying to go to 100% is seriously no fun but I also agree tests are not ideal.  The problem is indoor cyclists frequently don\u2019t go to 100% on longer efforts unless racing in Zwift or something so then the automatic versions don\u2019t do well either.  Anyone going on group rides with faster friends then them probably get close enough.  Generally we advise against going to 100% at all except maybe in a ramp test and in situations of joy or racing.</p>",

You want a plan to increase your ability to do ramp tests?   I am being \u201cfunny\u201d but pointing out the problem that other good coaches have idendified.  Everyone wants to build their FTP but really you should focus on building your ability to meet your end goal.  Faster at 60 minute efforts?  Faster at longer efforts?  Preparing for a race.  Just improving your FTP does not necessarily mean you are better prepared for your goal.   TrainerRoad pushes sweet spot because it does build your FTP rather quickly but the problem is that is a short term strategy.  If you want a long term strategy most would agree you need more periodization.</p>\n<p>We are a big fan of more zone 2 work now, and later in the season adding more intensity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/t/gcn-dive-into-zone-2/1828\">GCN dive into Zone 2</a></p>\n<p>But ultimately there is so many opinions on this stuff (ours seems to be more popular now and backed by more science but that does not mean it is the only solution).  Partially you need to do what is fun and motivates you and if you do too much intensity for too long you will start to fall apart and the next season you might start out doing more zone 2 <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",

My partner, Andrea, is an ex-pro coach and still pro-advisor and connected to many pro coaches he says many of the crazy kid pros are doing it all \u201cwrong\u201d right now and winning races\u2026 but taking high risks to get there.</p>",
