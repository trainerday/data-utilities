      "cooked": "<p>Many people struggle with a good outdoor structured training approach.  The way Coach Jack\u2019s workouts are designed I believe that can be improved.</p>\n<p>I know each rider has his own preferences.  Here are the main ideas I am focused on.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Outdoor text based</li>\n<li>Garmin</li>\n<li>Outdoor app (for example using our app outdoors)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Because Coach Jacks workouts are composed of 4 components.  Warm-up, main work, secondary work, and cool down.  Really only the main work should be followed closely.  In many cases the main work might only be 15-25 minutes of a 90 minute ride for example.</p>\n<p><span class=\"hashtag\">#1</span> - Outdoor Text Based  (could be called top tube sticker)<br>\n90m training<br>\n15m - warm up<br>\n20m - main work<br>\nSecondary work (Zone 2/3)<br>\n10m - cool down</p>\n<p>Really that can be written as<br>\n90m total - main work 3 X 1m@240w + 1.5m@rests</p>\n<p>You could have an email just sending you this main work and once you got used to it you could almost memorize after a quick pre-ride glance. No need to follow your garmin or an app.</p>\n<p>Many pros use this method of following a workout.  I think it is is a good one.</p>\n<p><span class=\"hashtag\">#2</span> Garmin<br>\nSo currently people can send their entire workout to Garmin but if you want to do your main work at a certian location (nice hill), it\u2019s hard to time it right.  We could do the lap button feature for warmup so you start and press lap to get to your main work\u2026 But we also could just create a workout that is only comprised of main work.  So 3 different Garmin options (current solution = strict, lap button, main work only)</p>\n<p><span class=\"hashtag\">#3</span> our app.  So I know most cyclists don\u2019t want to use a phone on their bike but slowly it seems people are moving in this direction.  We are planning on enhancing our app to record GPS (outdoor mode) and also considering this \u201cGarmin lap button\u201d functionality so you can focus on main work.</p>\n<p>All these features would and can work when you design your own workouts as well.</p>\n<p>My point here is just to get a discussion going that people give ideas on either how to improve the outdoor experience or feedback and deeper discussion what what I am presenting here.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/0297286b449c66f7059fc1bf3d9f4f2fcca0f7d4.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/0297286b449c66f7059fc1bf3d9f4f2fcca0f7d4\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0297286b449c66f7059fc1bf3d9f4f2fcca0f7d4_2_690x224.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"mUOaDIxHz8Je6EdFNsiNTw63zu\" width=\"690\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0297286b449c66f7059fc1bf3d9f4f2fcca0f7d4_2_690x224.jpeg, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0297286b449c66f7059fc1bf3d9f4f2fcca0f7d4_2_1035x336.jpeg 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/0297286b449c66f7059fc1bf3d9f4f2fcca0f7d4.jpeg 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0297286b449c66f7059fc1bf3d9f4f2fcca0f7d4_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1229\u00d7399 55.8 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",

Will there be routes within the same training session that include both the plain and the climb?<br>\nfurthermore, the recommended cadence number is not specified? (except for the SFR) and that everyone can then adapt to their needs.<br>\nI tried to search a little in the forum but I could not find anything about it.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Great questions.  Yes our product is still in beta and we are launching new features all the time.  Both climb / flat suggestions (better outdoor experience in general) as well as more cadence work will be launched before we are out of beta.</p>\n<p>We have agreement discussions with my coaches, that cadence work can help but is not the most critical thing (other than SFR due to it\u2019s totally different neromuscular quadrant that it targets).  But still we do feel it is important enough that we plan on adding it.  The consensous is you don\u2019t need to do a lot of RPM work but some cadence work each week can definitly help.  We would put cadence work almost in the skills category.</p>\n<p>A few examples we will add is Z2 short 30s intervals of 125-130 RPM work, as well as hills or harder efforts with 95-100 RPM work for longer intervals, most likely with RPM ramps starting 70-75 and building up to say 2 minutes at 95-100 rpm and then slowly increasing those durations.  Generally 1 workout a week that includes some cadence skill work is enough.</p>\n<p>Regarding flats or uphills yes this is definitly best practices, meaning sounds like you had a good coach or good recommendations.  We will start to add this information to each of our workout descriptions.  This will be starting to come soon (within a few weeks).  Hopefully completely finished in 2-weeks.</p>\n<p>See below this small indicator will say if it is better/easier indoors vs out and we will describe even if recommended for indoor how to do it outdoors.  SFR is best done on 5-8% grade, either shorter with repeats or longer if possible.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/0aa96a76f33e3d2a85258fe279cc316a98e8cc04.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/0aa96a76f33e3d2a85258fe279cc316a98e8cc04\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0aa96a76f33e3d2a85258fe279cc316a98e8cc04_2_689x300.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"1wjKhJjB70DM8hfSn64o8sLSlZG\" width=\"689\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0aa96a76f33e3d2a85258fe279cc316a98e8cc04_2_689x300.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0aa96a76f33e3d2a85258fe279cc316a98e8cc04_2_1033x450.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/0aa96a76f33e3d2a85258fe279cc316a98e8cc04.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0aa96a76f33e3d2a85258fe279cc316a98e8cc04_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1206\u00d7525 56.7 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>thanks Alex for the reply which suggests that you are already working on these improvements which is great and good for the site.  I would also add another request that for people like me who hate doing the roller and prefer free exits, the coach jack should ask during the preparation of the plan, the preferences of the cyclist, in order to privilege the workouts proposed in function of the cyclist\u2019s wishes.  It is clear that in this way everything becomes complicated, but a plan is useful if the cyclist does it, otherwise there are only beautiful tables.  once the plan has been made according to the wishes of the cyclist by jack, in the event that it is not possible to go out due to bad weather, it would be enough to always convert the 5 hours proposed for the original training plan through the jack coach to indoor.  it being understood that in an outdoor outing, all the more than 50 phases will not always be necessary to complete training.  however the site is very interesting and allows many excellent solutions.  I hope these suggestions are shared by the athletes of the forum.  thanks again Alex for what you are doing.  compliments.</p>",

I think I should do warmup as one interval with lap button press, main work has each timed intervals, and secondary work could be just a couple of timed intervals with zone focus the last secondary interval could be lap press to cool down or just skip the cool down outdoors.

I tried at the beginning of my cycling journey but phones are not made for that purposes. Especially when the weather conditions are challenging (wet = unresponsive touchscreen, cold = kills the battery life). While Garmin should be ashamed of themselves for marketing 90\u2019s looking technology that is slow af for such a hefty price tag, it still better meets my needs than a phone.</p>",
