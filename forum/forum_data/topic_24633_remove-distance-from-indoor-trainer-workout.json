You could set a goal to do 10,000km this year and this might inspire someone for example and indoor ERG contributes to that goal.</p>\n<p>I see motivation (or more directly consistency) as the most important factor in training and the one that many people including myself need to master.  So I have a friend that has been weight training consistently for 25 years rarely a missed week.  He does very minimal but seriously strong.  I met him as TD customer.  He says the <span class=\"hashtag\">#1</span> rule is do absolutely anything you can to stay consistent, even tiny little things that help. He has his girlfriend tell him he looks sexy when he is working out.  And if that means eating ice cream, eat ice cream.  He is 37, does not eat perfectly but very low body fat, and has been his whole life and very metabolically healthy.</p>\n<p>I mentioned this but I read the New York time article on Elaine LaLaine and she is 97 and works out ever day (her husband the forefather of fitness) She basically says the same thing.</p>\n<p>Since I have been semi-inconsistent (missing a month or two here or there each year and sometimes longer gaps) for much of my life.  This way of thinking has completely changed my view on training.  If you are not 100% consistent then the only thing that matters is motivation/consistency.</p>\n<p>I am putting words in his mouth as I have no idea why he wants speed and distance <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  But you can see that for some people it might be extremely important if it helps drive consistency, even just a small nudge towards consistency.  Most or many of us need every possible small nudge we can get.  I have started applying this to my life and training and so far it feels like it could be an amazing long term solution.</p>\n<p>Even though I liked weight training since I started in my mid-20s, I have never given it the priority it deserved so even more inconsistent than aerobic training.  From a longevity point of view I am thinking that is a serious mistake but luckily still fixable <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Must be coincidence but here\u2019s a copy of one of my recent posts on the Intervals forum regarding another discussion of \u2018Polarized\u2019</p>\n<p>Polarized training principles have been discussed over and over again. Mostly by people who don\u2019t believe in the underlying message that you need to do a lot less intensity and a lot more low intensity volume. All kinds of interpretations were made, one more correct then the other, to the point that Seiler himself apologizes for the fuss that was created.</p>\n<p>One important thing, in my opinion, is that Seiler\u2018s work is the result of statistical research on several decades of data from mostly pro-athletes. Some of that data dates from a time period where Power meters were not yet used regularly and thus only contains HR data. More recent data has both Power and HR in it.</p>\n<p>The conclusion from that statistical analysis was that pro\u2019s, do way less high intensity then what was generally thought. This was very different from what was on the menu for amateurs and recreational athletes, who in general had less training time filled with higher intensity.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not gone go through all the details on how things turned out but I will give my interpretation of how I see it. I may be wrong on some details but am pretty sure that the main message is correct.</p>\n<p>The very short version:</p>\n<p>Consistency is key! Anything comprising consistency must be avoided as much as possible. Meaning that the workout you do today, must be tailored in intensity and duration in such a way that you will be able to do your next planned workout with the highest quality possible. If you train 5 or more times a week, you must, for every single session, be sufficiently recovered to do that session with high quality. If you are to fatigued to do that session as intended, you loose the benefit of it. We all know that lower intensity sessions can build quite a bit of load/fitness while they are relatively easy to recover from. Higher intensity sessions require much more recovery time.</p>\n<p>Working out while not sufficiently recovered on regular bases, will dig a hole and performance will plateau or even diminish. A nice way of explaining this, is with the \u2018supercompensation\u2019 theory.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox wikipedia\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercompensation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">en.wikipedia.org</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    \n\n<h3><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercompensation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Supercompensation</a></h3>\n\n<p>In sports science theory, supercompensation refers to the post training period during which the trained function/parameter has a higher performance capacity than it did prior to the training period.\n Adaptation of load is called supercompensation.  The fitness level of a human body in training can be broken down into four periods: initial fitness, training, recovery, and supercompensation.  During the initial fitness period, the target of the training has a base level of fitness (shown by the fir...</p>\n\n  </article>\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1ca5be101736085c811d9ea3249a714e40912056.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"45qtbmq8RrAi0i4JwR1h5hb7doW\" width=\"534\" height=\"288\"></p>\n<p>Look at this chart and you will see three basic situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If no training follows before the end of the supercompensation phase, you return to base level. No progress is made, there\u2019s no consistency</li>\n<li>If you train too soon, before the recovery made it back to at least base level, your base level diminishes. You are digging a hole, overreaching, overtraining\u2026</li>\n<li>The ideal situation is to have your next session as close to the top of the supercompensation period as possible. The person who finds a way to pinpoint that timing, will be rich in no time <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\">. The result is an ever increasing base-level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All timings on the x axis and all amplitudes on the y axis are dependent on the intensity and the duration (time) of the former workout. The purpose of planning to get better is to maximize the outcome of this chain by also finding the right frequency of sessions. And then you have the three letters of FIT (Frequency-Intensity-Time/duration), unfortunately not in the best order, because building fitness is best done by first increasing Frequency, then Time (duration) and last Intensity.</p>\n<p>I could go on for a couple more hours on this subject, but I lack the time to get in to detail. I just hope that the above gives some more insight into the subject of planning for performance improvements. It\u2019s a very difficult subject because the number of variables is huge and every individual responds differently. So please, give your coach huge respect if his plan is making you perform better year after year.</p>",
