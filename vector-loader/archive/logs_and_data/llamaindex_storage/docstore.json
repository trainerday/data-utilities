Download it and install it.  \n[https://www.android.com/filetransfer/](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/)\n\nMake sure it is open, but it will give a warning or error message. Just say OK.

Connect USB in mode for File Transfer\u00a0App\n\nYou must hold the down button (on the right side) while inserting USB cable. After this step the window will open for the app showing your folders on your Elemnt. If not just go to the File transfer app, it should look like the screen on the next step on the left.\n\n### 3\\. Download and Transfer\u00a0Workout\n\nDownload workouts from ERGdb (we have 3000+ open source workouts) in MRC format and then just drag them into your plans folder.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0fW7KujescxncZnQy.png)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0Mu5FyWaSQyWQSW1U.png)\n\n### 4\\.

You get to planned workouts by clicking left side button and you will see it there.\n\n\\* If you previously connected to Training Peaks you need to go to your phone and unlink Training Peaks for this to work.\n\n### 5\\. Deleting\u00a0Workouts\n\nBelow Murray from Wahoo says you can just delete the workouts from the Elemnt without a problem now. I have not tested this.\n\n**Previous information below\u2026**  \nSo there has been a lot of discussion around deleting workouts. It appears that Dale Rider found a solution. You must create an empty text file and name it the same file name as in your plans folder (endurance60.plan as an example). So example\\_name.plan would be a workout. Then just drag and drop that file into your plans folder and overwrite the existing file. I am using Mac\u2019s Text Edit app in this example. I personally have not tested this solution but others say it works.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0tECQA7V8RNnacr38.png)\n\n### A Note From Wahoo\u00a0Support\n\nThe ELEMNT is not currently designed to support external workouts being manually added to the device, there is not a good way to delete the workouts. Some have been able to delete by connecting the device to a computer and removing, but this is not foolproof. We do sincerely apologize. As we add this support to the device in the future, it should allow for expanded capabilities.\n\nThank you,\n\nWahoo Support (I left the persons name out)\n\n### Windows 10\u00a0Video\n\nThis is a video showing both adding a workout and deleting a workout from a Wahoo Elemnt using Windows 10 on a PC.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3627, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbdf8f3e-c22a-4793-a406-cbefd5a87a19": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbdf8f3e-c22a-4793-a406-cbefd5a87a19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-trainerroad-vs-trainerday-3af06a19cd2b", "title": "Trainerroad Vs Trainerday", "category": "Other", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["reviews"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-trainerroad-vs-trainerday-3af06a19cd2b.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "135e043f-9475-4537-a919-65fdd4e32375", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-trainerroad-vs-trainerday-3af06a19cd2b", "title": "Trainerroad Vs Trainerday", "category": "Other", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["reviews"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-trainerroad-vs-trainerday-3af06a19cd2b.md"}, "hash": "b19723e1381a0edc6e226bcbd549564f581df5179c4662f1c79e6c8d6204bcd2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "I created what I believe are the core differences between TrainerRoad and TrainerDay in this video.

The body employs an efficient \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d policy with all our facilities. If your calf muscle only needs to be 12cm long. Why should the body waste valuable metabolic energy and resources building and maintaining 14cm of tissue? When the overwhelming stimulus of cycling says \u201cstiffer ankles are better,\u201d well that\u2019s just what you\u2019ll get. While that may be good for your short term goal of power transfer to the pedals, it\u2019s not good for your long term health and mobility that can cause additional problems that cause more down time in the future.\n\nWhen it comes to life off the bike, stiff ankles are not desirable. Studies have found (and most Physiotherapists will tell you) that reduced Ankle Dorsi Flexion (ADF, see below) can increase your likelihood of knee injury.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0QyCif-zcMZrA7tQ.png)\n\nAnkle Dorsi Flexion or ADF occurs when the angle at the front of the ankle decreases. Plantar flexion occurs when the tissues of the calf contract and shorten, so we don\u2019t usually suffer from a loss of plantar flexion.\n\n**A Greater Concern**\n\nOf perhaps greater concern still is (particularly for cyclists) is that decreased ADF is also [linked](https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jsr/21/2/article-p144.xml) to a decrease in the recruitment of the Quadriceps muscles during a squat. It\u2019s reasonable to surmise that this will also lead to decreased quadriceps activity in split squat positions and by extension walking up stairs and even up hill.\n\nWhether you\u2019re planning to lift weights this off-season or not, you can see that you may want to investigate your ADF.\n\nThe good news is, there\u2019s a simple test you can perform. I\u2019ve also added a few simple steps to increasing your ADF. With minimal equipment.\n\nIf you pass, good for you. But you may still benefit from maintaining and improving your ADF. If you fail, you should add the below protocol in order to clean up your ADF especially if you plan to hit the weights room.\n\nHere's where some advanced methodology comes in. Most of us have done static stretching for our calves, did you ever notice an improvement in your mobility afterwards? And if you did, did it last?\n\nStatic stretching alone is inferior to the integrative approach outlined below.\n\n*   **Release**. Unstick adhesions and trigger relaxation of erroneous protective mechanisms.\n*   **Traction**. Pull that released tissue into a greater length than it was previously capable of.\n*   **Integrate**. Teach the nervous system how to utilize that greater range of motion in order to keep your \u201csystem\u201d updates.\n\n**The Release Video**\n\n[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPTsi-HUuSQ)\n\n**Traction Video**\n\n[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gq2LNFJVA4)\n\n**The Integration Video**\n\n[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX_EM7h5x3w)\n\nSure, this will take longer than just a few minutes of static stretching after a workout. But here's the beauty of it. Once you can reliably pass the ADF test, all you need is The Integration piece once every week or so in order to maintain it. And over time, the change you illicit from each session will endure for longer and longer.\n\nThis 3-phase mobilization works all over the body in different joints. All you need is to know the specific movements to access the tissues you want.\n\nNext up, I'll be addressing off-season knee health before working our way further up the body.\n\nThis blog article has been provided by Alex Ackerley.

One of the key elements to successful training on Zwift is the training plan. Among the many training plans available, many riders are finding success by taking a more polarized approach to training plans. Containing both high-intensity and and a lot of low-intensity during your workouts.\n\n![Taking a polarized approach to Zwift can provide the best results and are very health focused](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1-7PhbYf6E7aFGpuOi4H6WQ.jpg)\n\n**The Principle of Polarized Training**\n\nPolarized training is a concept that has gained momentum in the world of cycling and endurance sports. It is rooted in the idea that focusing on two distinct training zones, high-intensity and low-intensity, can lead to more significant gains in performance and fitness. This means spending most of your training time at either very low intensity (zone 1) or very high intensity (zone 3) while minimizing time spent in the moderate-intensity zone (zone 2).\n\nTrainerDay has a plan builder with very polarized plans. They are designed by Coach Andrea Morelli that has coached some of the best cyclists in the world. They don\u2019t follow Dr Seiler\u2019s suggested way to train but they are very time and results proven and do contain a lot of easy and hard and follow the same nature as Dr Seiler suggests.\n\nMany cyclists including 4.3 w/kg and higher have followed Coach Jack plans with great success.\n\n**Successful Cyclists using the TrainerDay plan builder**\n\n[https://forums.trainerday.com/t/my-experience-with-trainer-day-so-far/1355](https://forums.trainerday.com/t/my-experience-with-trainer-day-so-far/1355)\n\nHere is another  \n[[2023-01-01-a-cyclist-and-his-coach-2dd63b2dc453.md|https://blog.trainerday.com/a-cyclist-and-his-coach-2dd63b2dc453]]\n\n**TrainerDay makes it easy and affordable**\n\nYou can download an entire plan and load it into your Zwift folder on your PC or Mac.

Use TrainerDay + TrainingPeaks (free version is fine) and you can sync calendars from TrainerDay to TrainingPeaks which will show your workout of the day (WOD) in Zwift each day.

I am not going to do any yard work, or take the stairs and maybe I will just sit around and watch TV or the computer/phone to recover this article is for you.\n\n![Recover faster. Mow your lawn.](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1buEm22l1iqB7MhS0qRxhWA.jpg)\n\nThe endurance world has for the most part accepted the idea of managing training stress. This is important if you are serious about performance, health and/or over-training.\n\nAdvanced endurance athletes use the TrainingPeaks PMC chart, a Whoop device or possibly heart rate variability (HRV) to manage their recovery. The problem is all these methods are very hit or miss for most people. I would argue managing training stress is more art than science.\n\nMath based training stress such as PMC can get you in the ball park especially if you are doing high volume training and that is the main stress factor in your life. Most people that get a Whoop and are serious about training ignore when it tells them not to train.\n\nI would argue that when you train hard you should recover, but I would also argue that if you want to recover better, forcing your body to recover following less optimum than optimum recovery practices can bring large benefits when done right. The problem is that for many people doing it right is likely a razors edge.\n\n**Meet Recovery Adaption Training\u200a\u2014**\u200aThe idea is move more to train more. There are a few key target audiences for this\n\n*   I don\u2019t have time to do a proper build phase and increase my training hours gradually before my target event or season. In many cases this means late winter / spring.\n*   I don\u2019t like to do lots of hours on an indoor trainer but when outdoor season comes I want to immediately ride as much as possible.\n*   Even when I build slowly once I get to X hours per week or Y days per week I start to fall apart.\n*   I want to get bad ass and I willing to be a little risky\n\n* * *\n\nBecause we are advocating training more to push the limits on your training, instead of more recovery this requires very tight control and/or self awareness.\n\nMowing the lawn is stress, digging is lots of stress, cross training is stress, even walking is low grade stress. Because the science has not caught up with this idea yet there are no studies comparing the efficiency of this but we all know the best athletes tend to train a lot. They recover in adverse cases. For the most part they do put sleep as a very, very high priority. If you can sleep a lot, eat reasonable most of the time, you have the core of recovery handled. Now you need to make burning other calories a part of both building endurance as well as recovering.\n\nYou need to experiment on your own. Try slowly doing, more and more. Count steps if you need to. Stop sitting as much as possible. Break up sitting by moving as often as you can. On a side note sit with good posture (neutral spine).\n\nIf you take this on and start to see patterns like waking in the night and having trouble sleeping, irritability, bad Whoop/HRV readings, your training performance declines. Pay close attention. If you can become good at high volumes of work, even if it is not on the bike, your body is stronger. Count calorie expenditure. Whoop seems pretty good at this. Build up to 6,000 calories a day 4/5 days a week. Even if that is only 6-hours a week of actual training. Variety helps. Weight training, rowing, other cross training. Yoga\u2026. Move more. Require less recovery. Get strong, and skinny (if you need to).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3599, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5702905-70ba-4a86-9903-8f13c7eee2e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5702905-70ba-4a86-9903-8f13c7eee2e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-cycling-training-made-easy-the-four-pillars-of-performance-586ade4b75e7", "title": "How To Determine Your W'", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Geek-Out", "tags": ["w-prime"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-cycling-training-made-easy-the-four-pillars-of-performance-586ade4b75e7.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "09e56201-9cfd-4dc0-942f-27ae3b097ed1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-cycling-training-made-easy-the-four-pillars-of-performance-586ade4b75e7", "title": "How To Determine Your W'", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Geek-Out", "tags": ["w-prime"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-cycling-training-made-easy-the-four-pillars-of-performance-586ade4b75e7.md"}, "hash": "d18e28269b2ab262aceca8a9270a9c1210c59be6848617aad03b5bc942a466cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "#### You must do these\u00a02-things\n\n *   Ride as hard as you can for approximately 3-minutes, keep going if you can go longer than 3\n*   Find an 8 to 20-minute max effort\n*   Alternatively, you can put your FTP in the second box and enter 40 minutes.\n\nThen just plug those values into our calculator\n\n#### [VIEW CALCULATOR HERE](https://trainerday.com/w-prime-calculator/)\n\n*   *This came from the GoldenCheetah Sweatpy project.

Higher Intensity\n\n4.  Zone 2\u200a\u2014\u200aLow Intensity\n\n6.  Polarized or mostly easy with some intensity\n\n8.  Classic Periodization\n\n10.  Chase the squirrels\u200a\u2014\u200aHow many people ride in Zwift\n\nSo there is a lot that can be said about each of these choices.\n\n**Let\u2019s start with, any of them might be the best choice for you!!!**\n\nIf you have any risk of losing motivation and stopping training during the winter that by far the most important one is the one that brings you the most enjoyment, and having fun should always be a top priority.\n\nAny of these choices can be done in any training app but option #2, #3, and #5 stand out for TrainerDay and our training app being one of the best choices. Any of these choices can be static training, meaning do it as planned no matter what. Any of them can also be made a more dynamic style of training, meaning change your training during the workout. We are strong believers in dynamic training and training by feel.\n\n**ERG mode should be a convenience not a contract!**\n\nOur app works extremely well with the dynamic model of training because you can go quickly from HR mode to ERG mode to slope mode within a workout as well as very quickly raise the intensity and even merge different workouts together on the fly.\n\n**I am not answering the question. Which is best?**\n\n**Regarding #1\u200a\u2014\u200aHigh intensity indoor training.** \u201ci.e. TrainerRoad style.\u201d You can design hard plans in Coach Jack or pick from our community workouts and plans but is this the best choice? Many riders understandably want to do a reverse periodization style of training, meaning high intensity interval training indoors in the winter and just have fun outdoors and not do structured training. This sounds perfect but it does have some draw backs.\n\nMany people ride fairly hard outdoors so that can mean that you end up with a December to June or longer doing higher intensity training, this includes your more focused high intensity at the beginning, which is the reverse of normal endurance training (i.e. reverse periodization).\n\nThe downside risk is that anyone riding like this is at high risk of burnout, over training or at least lowered motivation by the time they get to May/June. I was talking to pro coach Andrea Morelli (the designer of Coach Jack plans). Andrea, does not feel reverse periodization working very well from a top performance perspective and you would need to really do it right it to make it work for you.\n\nOne addition to to a high intensity winter could include doing a small base period in early March to let your body recover, but that\u2019s not easy for most people. Beautiful weather starting and you need to do focus on going really slow outdoors, good luck with that, strong dedication. Anyway it can be done, but just training hard in the winter and hoping for the best in late spring is not likely effective.\n\n**Option #2\u200a\u2014\u200ai.e. pure base\u200a\u2014**\u200acan be very effective but you need to fully buy into the idea, it\u2019s a mental struggle if you don\u2019t believe in it. Watch some Zone 2 GCN videos or google Inigo San Milan and see what he is suggesting. It has been shown this can be very effective on as little as 6 hours a week, but this is much longer discussion. One great benefit is you can be super hungry and excited when outdoor season starts and another is that indoor you can just watch Netflix and pedal easy\u00a0:)\n\nNumber #3 and #4 overlap but this is very classic style and how most pros train. They don\u2019t exactly follow the 80/20 principal of polarized training but they do include a a lot of easy in their training, getting progressively harder towards race season.\n\nCoach Jack creates great plans that fit traditional periodization and you could just do base, build and peak periods.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3885, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "120e1211-90e9-4cbe-b572-979d4545d4dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "120e1211-90e9-4cbe-b572-979d4545d4dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-what-type-of-training-to-do-this-winter-fe8f9287cee2", "title": "What Type Of Training To Do This Winter", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-what-type-of-training-to-do-this-winter-fe8f9287cee2.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9fa2a960-66fa-4155-b3ff-6a5d38e4171a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-what-type-of-training-to-do-this-winter-fe8f9287cee2", "title": "What Type Of Training To Do This Winter", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-what-type-of-training-to-do-this-winter-fe8f9287cee2.md"}, "hash": "b8ca39aebe6292ec965776061a52849df63a08995adf760a405e333b2dc0ad4f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "707e2f18-142b-4e5b-bf94-2d4972c7f292", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-what-type-of-training-to-do-this-winter-fe8f9287cee2", "title": "What Type Of Training To Do This Winter", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-what-type-of-training-to-do-this-winter-fe8f9287cee2.md"}, "hash": "0b9b364743de4ef45460f3cf79d98766e0f80832e288ab1ac47dae11150ee4e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pure base\u200a\u2014**\u200acan be very effective but you need to fully buy into the idea, it\u2019s a mental struggle if you don\u2019t believe in it.

Indoors it could be more structured and outdoors can move to more dynamic training by feel just focusing mostly on volume and trying to control the urge and moderate your intensity so your outdoor season starts a bit easier and moves to higher intensity as your season progresses. It does not need to be super strict training to see good/great results just following the basic good practices in training. You don\u2019t need to be spending long periods of time at threshold at the beginning of the season, wait until you get closer to your peak season. Don\u2019t forget the critical daily, weekly, monthly and yearly recovery periods. i.e. Sleep, days off, recovery weeks and base periods.\n\n**And finally #5\u200a\u2014\u200aChasing squirrels** it sounds negative but actually can be very fun and the reason that Zwift is so successful as people get motivated by other people around and want to chase the ones that are about your speed or race. Generally this would not be considered an optimum training plan and aligns much closer to high intensity winters, but if it motivates you and you are smart with it probably including a mini base period in the late winter early spring it might be part of a plan that works for you. It\u2019s not the way most pros train but we are strong believers in doing what\u2019s fun and trying to manage your stress and health around this.\n\nIf you want to chase squirrles but do it right include easy days in ERG mode.

Cycling is 95\u201399% aerobic other than short sprint races. So unless you are a podium finisher and/or doing doing sprint type events you should focus most of seasonal training on improving your aerobic capacity. Sprint strength makes you feel good and strong and it might even improve an FTP test, especially a ramp test, but it\u2019s not what \u201ckeeps you in the game.\u201d\n\nAnaerobic work capacity, AWS or W\u2019 does have value but only after you have a solid aerobic base. For example your anaerobic sprints can help you bridge the gaps to catch a faster peloton, or keep your fast friends from sprinting away from you. But if you don\u2019t have that aerobic power \u201cbase\u201d you are not going to be there in the first place.\n\nAs you can see below, after about 8-minutes anaerobic provides a small percent in helping you keep up\u2026 and after 35 minutes forget it.\n\n![Aerobic vs Anaerobic Power time availability](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1zRYbzDWLNY6QaK1QLrdV5w.png)\n\nSo your slow twitch or \u201caerobic muscles\u201d and system are very valuable. How do you best train them? Lots of \u201cZone 2.\u201d\n\nIn this video below by GCN with Dr I\u00f1igo San Mill\u00e1n, coach to Tadej Poga\u010dar talking about how to choose your intensity for Zone 2 as well as the the benefits of Zone 2. It\u2019s not exactly the same as power based Zone 2 based on your FTP but generally it\u2019s likely to be around middle to upper heart rate Zone 2.\n\n[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at3MPoK53dU)\n\nDr I\u00f1igo\u2019s makes the point that having a great aerobic / slow twitch muscle system will help you utilize lactate for fuel which also removes the lactate more rapidly. This allows you to spend more time around you lactate threshold (FTP) or ultimately raising your FTP.\n\nHe also states: Focus your training on targeting energy systems. Power zone focus is less important. He does feel that Zone 3 of Coggan\u2019s Zones is not focusing on any particular energy system so if you are limited on time\u00a0, focusing on your energy systems becomes extra critical.\n\n* * *\n\n**Heart Stroke Volume.**\n\nFor those of us that are not elite athletes, there is another point to consider. **Improve your heart stroke volume** meaning the amount of blood your heart can pump in a single beat.\n\nAs you improve your aerobic system, you improve your stroke volume. There are many signs this is true. One that most of us are aware of is that even with lots of training **we do not increase our maximum heart rate** and it\u2019s not something we work on to improve. So one of the primary ways to get more blood flow and more air to your muscles, is that you need to improve your heart stroke volume.\n\nIt\u2019s very obvious stroke volume increases to anyone that starts training regularly. You see this because your night time or resting heart rate continues to drop. I was not training much in my 40s and at 46 my resting heart rate was about 60 bpm. After training for the last 10-years, my resting heart rate is down around 46 bpm. This came with semi-consistent primarily Zone 1 and 2 training. As you may know many pros have a resting heart rate in the 30s.\n\nAn interesting concept is that from Zone 1 to Zone 2, your your stroke volume keeps increasing. Once your aerobic threshold around the top of Zone 2, your stroke volume stops increasing and all the additional oxygen comes from increased heart rate. So if you cause adaption in stroke volume, just like everything else you need to stress your \u201cstroke volume\u201d close to it\u2019s maximum, which happens to be your aerobic threshold (AeT)\u2026 So in this case hard training is zone 2 and you don\u2019t need to do more than zone 2.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3707, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c4964fd-8c81-4f5f-b4d9-42816a8f1533": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c4964fd-8c81-4f5f-b4d9-42816a8f1533", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-zone-2-training-hmmm-is-cycling-is-still-an-aerobic-sport-11b19d1e0f29", "title": "Zone 2 Training: Hmm, Is Cycling Still an Aerobic Sport?", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["zone-2"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-zone-2-training-hmmm-is-cycling-is-still-an-aerobic-sport-11b19d1e0f29.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2c33bd73-fbeb-468a-b1b1-214064d5b0ce", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-zone-2-training-hmmm-is-cycling-is-still-an-aerobic-sport-11b19d1e0f29", "title": "Zone 2 Training: Hmm, Is Cycling Still an Aerobic Sport?", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["zone-2"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-zone-2-training-hmmm-is-cycling-is-still-an-aerobic-sport-11b19d1e0f29.md"}, "hash": "c751b0ef6a9d5fa74f50629e0c85c313a33513d687950a5b94f5b39b90643e9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf3e2385-c473-4b40-ad59-7ef5959d6f1b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-zone-2-training-hmmm-is-cycling-is-still-an-aerobic-sport-11b19d1e0f29", "title": "Zone 2 Training: Hmm, Is Cycling Still an Aerobic Sport?", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["zone-2"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-zone-2-training-hmmm-is-cycling-is-still-an-aerobic-sport-11b19d1e0f29.md"}, "hash": "781ca5142c5fed23e139dfc43895f6a033846c69e2a1735481c1ef54946e1a46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7c4cf53-4c39-4302-ab8a-8a5e9727c51e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cea4824ca37afc700a935526a32d7d01ed4a62aa4195fb4528cfb91f5c0fbd8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "I was not training much in my 40s and at 46 my resting heart rate was about 60 bpm.

One idea I like is Coach Chad from TrainerRoad that says \u201cminimum effective dose.\u201d By his definition that would be zone 2 for aerobic improvement.\n\nOur Coach Andrea also suggests spending lots of time in zone 2. The year might start out between 100/0 and 95/5 meaning 100% zone one and two or 95% zone one and two and slowly move towards 80/20 towards your peak season or possibly even up to 70/30 depending on how much you are training.\n\nThese are just rough estimates but the point is most of your year is doing easy zone 1, zone 2 training. Ultimately these variable % of time in zone is just a periodized version of Dr Seiler\u2019s Polarizied Training.\n\nWe would not call zone 3 \u201cno mans land\u201d and it can be a part of a lot of fun rides but it just does not need to be a primary target zone and if you see yourself spending too much time there you likely need to learn to back off for your best performance.\n\nSo Zone 2 also is great for health. There are so many good reasons to learn how to train correctly which means lot\u2019s of constraint. Consistent Zone 2 can be very challenging, but most of the best athletes have the most control of their life and their training. They don\u2019t just go out and push it medium hard all the time. Neither should you.\n\n* * *\n\n**So now what?**\n\nIf this Zone 2 focus makes sense to you and you want to become the \u201cking or queen\u201d of zone 2 training, it\u2019s fairly well accepted that Coach and Author Dr Phil Maffetone is a leader in low heart-rate training.\n\nTo clarify, Dr I\u00f1igo San Mill\u00e1n is ultimately talking about low heart rate training. Dr Maffetone has also trained the best of the best in runners and triathletes, and gives a clear strategic program on how to make sure you become the ultimate fat burning machine.\n\nAs a highlight, here are some of Dr Maffetone\u2019s suggestions\n\n*   Don\u2019t eat carbs before your fat burning workout, if it is a long one maybe add them later in the workout. Carbs will drive your body towards burning glucose faster.\n*   Spend long periods of time doing pure base, and learn to experiment to see if more anaerobic work slows your aerobic progression.\n*   Do a slow warmup process. If you shock your body into thinking it\u2019s doing something, it will switch to glucose burning mode.\n*   Focus on never going over over your AeT to ensure you don\u2019t get out of fat burning mode. Generally it\u2019s always some mix of fat and carbs but the goal is to keep it very predominantly fat utilization.\n*   Maffetone has a 180 formula which some people don\u2019t agree with but the main point of Maffetone and Dr I\u00f1igo San Mill\u00e1n is, if you pay close attention you can learn to feel when you are in fat burning mode and set a baseline heart rate target. There are other methods of determining this as well.

Base, Build and Peak. These three blocks or periods were popularized by Joe Friel.\n\nWhile each block serves a purpose, this article is about the build block. If you come into your build period with a solid base and reasonably rested, then the build period is when you will see your biggest gains of the year.\n\nHours for an example build period\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1pANPAEVLXEsb8nrBfIcX7A.png)\n\n**A \u201cperfect\u201d build block sets you up for a perfect season.** A great build period is fun but also can be a dangerous and it is easy to get it wrong. Assuming you are consistent in your training, doing too much is likely worse than doing too little. Too much leads to burn out an injury, but slightly too little just means you might want to push a little harder later in your season.\n\nIf you go into your build period with a lot of previous hard training or accumulated training stress then you increase the chance that you are burned out before you get to your desired peak period. Most people can only handle about 4\u20136 months of continuous pushing before becoming over worked.\n\nJack is well designed for an optimum build period. You can have multiple build periods in the year but the most common time for elite road cyclists tends to be late January through the end of March.\n\nAfter your build period, you want to do activities that mimic your primary goal as much as possible but during the build period you can follow more of a generic program.\n\nSo the point you came here for \u201cTweaking the knobs.\u201d\n\nThe first \u201cknob\u201d is the build block type. Proven with many elite and pro cyclists and our favorite is the Serious Italian but really any of these other than the Base block types make sense for a build block depending on how you like to train and how much time you have. All these build blocks have 3-key workouts.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1VAnoRcjpYQI1mY-ukYsgcg.png)\n\nBelow \u201cEdit Custom\u201d this let you define your own blocks but are still based on logical progressions and Coach Jack\u2019s rules. While we know many pro riders that start out the season on the Serious Italian Intensity level #1, many people coming from other platforms don\u2019t believe that level of intensity is enough for them. We have some other interesting options highlighted below that when combined with the intensity slider, the ramp rate and ride feel can give you seriously hard workouts. They might look ok in the beginning but by the end you might have wish you had chosen a softer plan\u00a0:) You need progression, so look at the last weeks of the build period to make sure you can handle them.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-142rtDhWAU2rH1e4q96mfuQ.png)\n\nSFR and Dynamic Force are amazing workouts that most riders don\u2019t do today. They target strength endurance by focusing on high pressure (newton meter) pedal strokes via lower RPM training.\n\nBelow is our ramp rate slider. This is both a combination of TSS increases as well as hour increases. We don\u2019t believe people should have fixed hours and high variability in intensity as that changes the whole nature of training and becomes a TSS and intensity focused plan which we do not feel is the optimum way to train.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1GPaTDdRsjy85BzE8bQbeFg.png)\n\nThis 3/1 or 2/1 means 3 hard weeks followed by 1 easy week or 2 hard weeks followed by 1 easy week. People in heavy race seasons need more recovery and might choose 2/1 as well as masters riders also frequently need more recovery. If at the end of 3 weeks you are feeling tired you might want to consider switch to the 2/1 pattern.\n\nYou also can see customize daily limits which allows you to put a limit on how long each ride is.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3810, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e22902f-f743-4349-af60-29988eae38ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e22902f-f743-4349-af60-29988eae38ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2024-03-14-coach-jack-plans-how-to-tweak-jacks-plans-for-a-perfect-build-period-5ac74acf09ed", "title": "Coach Jack Plans: How to Tweak Jack's Plans for a Perfect Build Period", "category": "Features", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["coach-jack"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2024-03-14-coach-jack-plans-how-to-tweak-jacks-plans-for-a-perfect-build-period-5ac74acf09ed.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06988431-a335-45a2-9bf1-d557d278a106", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2024-03-14-coach-jack-plans-how-to-tweak-jacks-plans-for-a-perfect-build-period-5ac74acf09ed", "title": "Coach Jack Plans: How to Tweak Jack's Plans for a Perfect Build Period", "category": "Features", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["coach-jack"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2024-03-14-coach-jack-plans-how-to-tweak-jacks-plans-for-a-perfect-build-period-5ac74acf09ed.md"}, "hash": "16682410d253c4df748e606b4cb40b6df2af8955c4bb5e5e54b70e0f7f5c5805", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "863ee82e-353a-49ce-9807-577363870176", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2024-03-14-coach-jack-plans-how-to-tweak-jacks-plans-for-a-perfect-build-period-5ac74acf09ed", "title": "Coach Jack Plans: How to Tweak Jack's Plans for a Perfect Build Period", "category": "Features", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["coach-jack"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2024-03-14-coach-jack-plans-how-to-tweak-jacks-plans-for-a-perfect-build-period-5ac74acf09ed.md"}, "hash": "e1136314d9093958061ec639c970195a04cf642d6a04a3d3ce4c9479b3f98dac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We don\u2019t believe people should have fixed hours and high variability in intensity as that changes the whole nature of training and becomes a TSS and intensity focused plan which we do not feel is the optimum way to train.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1GPaTDdRsjy85BzE8bQbeFg.png)\n\nThis 3/1 or 2/1 means 3 hard weeks followed by 1 easy week or 2 hard weeks followed by 1 easy week.

They start out easy and by the end of the block get to a reasonable level of difficult. You do not need to train at your maximum level or any where close to failure. You can gradually build up so that your build block never feels too hard. Our pro coach advisor and the designer of these plans Andrea Morelli realizes this is not what most people preach. But Tour de France winners have used very similar plans so you can too. It just requires a change in thinking.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-15sXveVuIU5eu0t6y3ffoWA.png)\n\nYou also see ride feel above. If you are a slave to TSS or just love pain, cranking ride feel up, a custom plan as suggested above and the intensity slider up to 10 you can get some hard workouts.

This article is a quick guide to the three types of indoor cycling.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1dHHYgDpVndRUPRt4jtdXwg.png)\n\n**Virtual outdoor cycling\u200a\u2014**\u200aThese are apps such as FulGaz or Rouvy that pair real-life ride footage with your indoor trainer. Instead of a virtual world like Watopia in Zwift, you will be virtually riding real-life roads in Italy, France, or California. In order to get this footage, these apps put cameras on the bikes of riders who complete these routes IRL, and then upload the footage to the app.\n\nWhile virtual cycling may be a bit clunkier than pure virtual training apps, they are certainly the most realistic and transformative, creating a virtual reality cycling experience like no other. You can even complete workouts and races on some of these apps, and compete against other virtual avatars on real-life roads.\n\n**Structured Training\u2014** Forget all the fancy visuals and stimulating gimmicks, these apps are all about structured interval training. TrainerRoad is the most popular example of this style of app, which prioritizes dedicated training rather than group rides, social connection, or racing. TrainerDay is a similar app to TrainerRoad with a few different features and a much lower price.\n\nThese apps, such as TrainerDay, include hundreds\u200a\u2014\u200aand sometimes thousands\u200a\u2014\u200aof structured workouts designed to make you faster. Some apps will help create a custom training plan designed to fit you and your cycling goals, while others will be more of a free-for-all and let you pick whatever workout you want. In the app, there isn\u2019t much to look at other than your power and heart rate graph. Some apps, like Wahoo SYSTM, including videos of real-life racing to help keep you entertained, but nothing that matches up with your effort like a virtual avatar in Zwift. TrainerRoad is even simpler, with only numbers to look at, it takes a dedicated and focused cyclist to get through these workouts.\n\n**Zwift\u200a\u2014**\u200aThe world\u2019s most popular indoor cycling app, Zwift, is a blend between virtual outdoor cycling and power interval training. You could even argue that it is a \u2018virtual indoor cycling app\u2019 because many of its routes and worlds are imaginary. In fact, the original Zwift world of Watopia is completely made up. Though Zwift does include many real-life routes such as NYC, Innsbruck, Yorkshire, and Richmond, it does mix in a plethora of virtual routes as well.\n\nThere are also thousands of workouts to choose from on Zwift\u200a\u2014\u200athere are literally overall 2000 workouts on the app\u200a\u2014\u200awhich means that you can get all of your structured training done too. However, you\u2019ll need to ride one of Zwift\u2019s routes during the workout, which can be overstimulating compared to the distraction-free backdrops of TrainerDay.\u00a0  \nSpin bike classes\n\nThe most popular name in this space is Peloton, which has a dedicated following and a user base in the millions. Spin bike classes are more like following a workout video than they are virtual cycling. There are no virtual worlds, no virtual bikes or avatars, and many times, there isn\u2019t even a power measurement or display. Instead, these apps tell you how hard you\u2019re working based on heart rate, resistance level, and cadence.\n\nPeloton and other spin bike classes include real-life footage of real spin class instructors to guide you through a spin bike workout. These bikes are not smart trainers; in fact, they are exclusively indoor bikes. The spin classes are entertaining and engaging, with high-energy instructors and fitting background music. These classes are designed more for recreational cyclists and fitness enthusiasts than for dedicated cyclists. Nevertheless, spin bike classes have their place in the indoor cycling world, as you\u2019d be hard-pressed to have as much fun while completing a lung-busting workout.\n\nWritten by Zach Nehr", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4131, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "446e14bd-3dd6-4e9d-80ec-4f9aed9c734b": {"__data__": {"id_": "446e14bd-3dd6-4e9d-80ec-4f9aed9c734b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-coach-jack-block-types-dac5e6d91d27", "title": "Coach Jack Block Types", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["coach-jack"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-coach-jack-block-types-dac5e6d91d27.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5c95f9d1-0f14-42be-987f-31dd7fb9d119", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-coach-jack-block-types-dac5e6d91d27", "title": "Coach Jack Block Types", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["coach-jack"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-coach-jack-block-types-dac5e6d91d27.md"}, "hash": "698cac53d1c597118faaaa86ab53ab1096c8c2d95763898aad67a6bdd3e8264b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1PX1ii78bIjYnQfJcZZAFsg.png)\n\nPeriodization 101\u200a\u2014\u200aStandard Block\u00a0Types\n\nWhen you select \u201cSpecific Event Date\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aCoach Jack supports up to 4 block types. **Base, Build, Peak and Event Blocks.**\n\nThrough out your year following quality periodization principals, will make a huge difference in the how you feel, reduce your risks of injury and help you reach peak performance at the right time of the year. Many people try to keep peak performance all year long and this is a great way to stop your forward progress and burn out.\n\nThere are different methods of periodization that can work. It could be cycles of 3 months, 6 months or a full year.\n\n**Each block has a purpose**\n\n**Base Block**\u200a\u2014\u200aAerobic increase or at least maintenance and rest preparation for the harder blocks. This might be CJ recommend blocks or HR Zone 2 focus for example.\n\n**Build Block**\u200a\u2014\u200aStart off easy from base, and slowly build to more duration and intensity. You don\u2019t need to kill yourself, starting easy with small increases will cause adaption. This period prepares you for a peak period.\n\n**Peak Block**\u200a\u2014\u200aThis is typically a shorter period but by the end should be hard. We don\u2019t believe you need to kill yourself in training but this will put the icing on the cake, especially if you mix in some fast group rides, full effort sprints outside or a b-race as a tune up to prepare you for your first a-race or primary event.\n\n**Event Block**\u200a\u2014\u200aAfter your first A-race or primary first event, you might have other events. During this time, it\u2019s more about maintaining fitness and not burning out. If you have been cycling a while don\u2019t expect big seasonal improvements during this time as you should have been close to your peak at your first A-level event.\n\nThis is very standard linear periodization.

If recovery rides provide recovery for you, then you can add some Z1 rides on your days off. Many plans on our site have a lot of hard days. You can cone one of those plans, selecting 3 or 4 days a week, and then add in some recovery rides manually. Should only take a few minutes.\n\nRecovery rides should be Zone 1. Such as this.

But most of the cycling world has moved to ramp tests for a good reason.\n\nHere are the primary reasons\n\n*   Both the 8 and 20-minute tests are painful. This means you won\u2019t want to perform them often.\n*   Both the 8 and 20-minute require precise pacing, which most riders frequently fail or feel they could have done better. Screwing up the pacing can reduce your motivation because you get a lower FTP.\n*   The ramp test is almost a fun workout, except for the last 2-minutes. The results are highly consistent, but just might need a slight adjustment down if you have a sprinter profile.\n\nFrom a training perspective, using a ramp test FTP estimation to base your training is accurate enough. From a TT race pacing perspective, you need to investigate that and potentially spend the first 1/2 slightly under your FTP.\n\nNo testing protocol is consistently accurate. Even lab tests are inaccurate. I have discussed this at length with a few top coaches and they all agree the ramp test is a superior testing protocol and accurate enough to accomplish the principal goal.\n\n**The Standard Modern Ramp Test**\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0BhDsCpmXs-jrDTce.png)\n\nYou can easily perform a ramp test using the paid version of our app. Just copy this workout to your library.\n\n[https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/whoosh-ramp-test-2](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/whoosh-ramp-test-2)\n\nFind your average watts of the last minute before failure. Taking this and multiply times 0.75 (75%). This will give you the same or very similar FTP scoring to the other major platforms. In talking with a pro lab-coach, when comparing this power-based ramp test to actual blood lactate levels, riders fall between 0\u00a0.7-.8. 0.75 is a great middle range.\n\n**Below is Strava Metrics**\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0w5g1pN1y0bUi4rws.png)\n\nJust select the last minute before failure. You can use many popular software packages, such as Strava. TrainingPeaks, GoldenCheetah and others.\n\nHappy testing\u2026 Below is a slight introduction if needed. Thanks ~alex\n\n**What is FTP?**\n\nJust as a brief introduction in case someone is unsure. FTP is Functional Threshold Power. This is the average power you can sustain for 40\u201360 minutes. Above FTP is where you produce more lactate than your body can remove, so you have a significantly shorter amount of time you can operate at this level. Monitoring your FTP and improving it is both motivation and information. It makes it clearer to you what training is working and what is not.\n\n**How Often Should You Test Your FTP?**\n\nThat\u2019s a very personal question\u00a0:) Meaning if you have not tested in a while and don\u2019t know your FTP before a training plan is good. If you are following a training plan and you are half way into a build period that\u2019s also a good time. Generally if you like tests, you can do them every 4 weeks or so but more so I would recommend every 8 weeks or even longer, especially during periods of slower increases. 10 watts off here or there are not going to have a major impact on your training plan. Especially when we are talking about the Coach Jack plan builder because it is very incremental and should never be kill yourself difficult. The peak period can get pretty hard but you will be prepared for it.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3447, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "204e9a60-9384-44f4-88f5-739303e9e49f": {"__data__": {"id_": "204e9a60-9384-44f4-88f5-739303e9e49f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-indoor-cycling-trainers-smart-vs-non-smart-1a44ba928154", "title": "Indoor Cycling Trainers Smart Vs Non Smart", "category": "Indoor", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["equipment"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-indoor-cycling-trainers-smart-vs-non-smart-1a44ba928154.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dad5c41a-97e7-4b49-85e0-d36c8e849ec7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-indoor-cycling-trainers-smart-vs-non-smart-1a44ba928154", "title": "Indoor Cycling Trainers Smart Vs Non Smart", "category": "Indoor", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["equipment"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-indoor-cycling-trainers-smart-vs-non-smart-1a44ba928154.md"}, "hash": "dbe9d0b20cab5dbc8a0bf905fa7d98e50ccf58656a806c28e2c4019e266eff82", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7cad823f-ad40-4f05-93f5-9a29fa0c222d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "24a59d27dd50817992c642be610b62f13933d6fd6e1bb760a5687f99a396a26b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Everything you need to know about Smart vs Non-Smart Indoor Trainers  \nWhen it comes to choosing an indoor trainer, there are N+1 options to choose from, built by tens of different manufacturers, and all within a massive price range of $200\u20131500. But how big is the difference between a $200 trainer and a $1500 trainer?\n\n![Smart Trainer vs Dumb Trainer](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1gr4fQIRxl03MBD6OZ7s9WA.png)\n\nOne of the biggest differentiating factors between indoor trainers is smart capability. \u201cSmart\u201d trainers are indoor cycling trainers that attach to your bike and have the capabilities of being controlled by an app, such as Zwift. These trainers measure power, and sometimes cadence as well, using internal sensors, so you don\u2019t necessarily need additional power meters or cadence sensors on your bike.\n\nSmart trainers adjust the gradient to match an indoor cycling harder or easier in accordance with the virtual gradient. A smart trainer will make a +7% grade feel very hard, and a -3% grade feel fairly easy, for example. You can also adjust the degree of trainer resistance, or even turn it off. 100% trainer difficulty means that the trainer\u2019s resistance will match the virtual gradient, making a +7% gradient feel like a +7% gradient (so you\u2019re going to need the little ring).\n\nUsers can adjust the trainer difficulty at any time, so you can play with the settings to see which is best for you. Most riders use a smart trainer difficulty setting of 20\u201350%, as this allows you to climb more virtual hills and tackle 12% gradients without pedaling too hard or running out of gears. For the complete IRL riding experience, some riders use 100% trainer difficulty which feels just like riding outside.\n\nYou can also use ERG mode on smart trainers, which is a workout mode where the trainer will automatically adjust its resistance to fit a desired power output. Within a given workout, when the interval says to ride at 200w, the smart trainer will automatically adjust its resistance to 200w, and all you need to do is pedal. The trainer will make minor adjustments to keep your cadence around 85\u201390rpm, which means that it doesn\u2019t really matter which gear you\u2019re in during an ERG mode interval. This is great for structured workouts, such as the ones that we have here on TrainerDay.\n\nSmart trainers are significantly more expensive than non-smart (i.e. dumb) trainers, which don\u2019t have the internal electronic capabilities, nor an internal power meter. The cheapest smart trainers you can find are wheel-on smart trainers, which start around $300. For a direct drive smart trainer (which takes the place of your bike\u2019s rear wheel and attaches directly to the rear dropouts), the cheapest versions start at $650, with the high-end models such as the Tacx NEO 2T costing $1400.\n\nFor a much more affordable option, you can buy a non-smart, or dumb, trainer for less than $250. A dumb trainer is an indoor trainer which attaches your bike to an adjustable resistance drum, but one that cannot connect to external apps. This rear drum is what creates the resistance for your rear wheel, and it is how you adjust the resistance during your ride. However, you won\u2019t typically be able to adjust the resistance during your ride; rather, you\u2019ll set the resistance at the beginning of your ride when you tighten the drum onto your rear tire.\n\nThus, in order to make your ride harder or easier\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as during a set of intervals\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can shift gears, just as you would on a flat road outside.\u00a0  \nDumb trainers are significantly cheaper than smart trainers, but they are much less capable. These indoor trainers don\u2019t measure power on their own, and you\u2019ll have to focus on your own effort to hit target wattages, or simulate riding up or down hills.\n\nYou can connect to external apps while riding a dumb trainer, but it won\u2019t be the trainer itself that is doing the connecting. Instead, you will need an external power meter (pedals, crank arm, or bottom bracket), a speed sensor, or a cadence sensor.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4036, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7cad823f-ad40-4f05-93f5-9a29fa0c222d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7cad823f-ad40-4f05-93f5-9a29fa0c222d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-indoor-cycling-trainers-smart-vs-non-smart-1a44ba928154", "title": "Indoor Cycling Trainers Smart Vs Non Smart", "category": "Indoor", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["equipment"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-indoor-cycling-trainers-smart-vs-non-smart-1a44ba928154.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dad5c41a-97e7-4b49-85e0-d36c8e849ec7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-indoor-cycling-trainers-smart-vs-non-smart-1a44ba928154", "title": "Indoor Cycling Trainers Smart Vs Non Smart", "category": "Indoor", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["equipment"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-indoor-cycling-trainers-smart-vs-non-smart-1a44ba928154.md"}, "hash": "dbe9d0b20cab5dbc8a0bf905fa7d98e50ccf58656a806c28e2c4019e266eff82", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "204e9a60-9384-44f4-88f5-739303e9e49f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-indoor-cycling-trainers-smart-vs-non-smart-1a44ba928154", "title": "Indoor Cycling Trainers Smart Vs Non Smart", "category": "Indoor", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["equipment"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-indoor-cycling-trainers-smart-vs-non-smart-1a44ba928154.md"}, "hash": "4bbce986e378d00abf85d6a3019e3bdd4f53a72e54dd6d385959da017d98c16f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "However, you won\u2019t typically be able to adjust the resistance during your ride; rather, you\u2019ll set the resistance at the beginning of your ride when you tighten the drum onto your rear tire.\n\nThus, in order to make your ride harder or easier\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as during a set of intervals\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can shift gears, just as you would on a flat road outside.\u00a0  \nDumb trainers are significantly cheaper than smart trainers, but they are much less capable.

You will still be able to perform intervals and change the resistance, but now it\u2019s up to you instead of the app.\n\nWritten by Zach Nehr", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3185, "end_char_idx": 4860, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43adf0bd-748f-49b0-986a-c65fe67b8604": {"__data__": {"id_": "43adf0bd-748f-49b0-986a-c65fe67b8604", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-free-ride-and-open-ended-intervals-garmin-zwift-209a3c50db41", "title": "Free Ride And Open Ended Intervals Garmin Zwift", "category": "Features", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["garmin", "training-peaks"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-free-ride-and-open-ended-intervals-garmin-zwift-209a3c50db41.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5fbe36bb-e221-4a3b-99cf-f0c4e6eeba1d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-free-ride-and-open-ended-intervals-garmin-zwift-209a3c50db41", "title": "Free Ride And Open Ended Intervals Garmin Zwift", "category": "Features", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["garmin", "training-peaks"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-free-ride-and-open-ended-intervals-garmin-zwift-209a3c50db41.md"}, "hash": "02fd83c00afbc8e8536525922d0363d61f45ecd95ca0fa387b0252d867aba202", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "### Garmin Open Ended Intervals\n\nOpen-ended intervals means it will just keep going until you hit the lap button on your Garmin unit.

ERG is the most popular for workouts but even though we are the biggest ERG workout platform, we believe in a more wholistic approach. ERG is great for a specific purpose, but the other modes are great as well\n\nThe Four Modes of TrainerDay\n\n**Mode 1\u200a\u2014\u200aERG**\n\nERG is perfect for a few cases. One is when you just want to watch a movie or not think about the training itself but hit specific power targets. This is specially good for training in Zones 1 thru 4. It can also work reasonably well for Zone 5 with some adjustments. Most workouts are designed around your FTP but there is a [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|problem with workouts that are Zone 5 or higher.]]\n\nGenerally ERG is the main workhorse of indoor workouts. We believe training should be more dynamic based on how you feel, but ERG works well, you must might want to press the + or - buttons in our app at times. You don\u2019t need to kill yourself on the days that just feel a bit off.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1qQAVHxMXHWGJQWp3uWB0vQ.png)\n\n**Slope Mode**\n\nOur app has slope mode which you can instantly switch to at the click of a button. You also can design workouts that automatically switch to slope mode with a specific slope angle (design your own hills).\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1V3lIJfwpM6Ho4iv-r19e0Q.png)\n\nSlope mode is great because you can use your gears and cadence to control your power output and you can decide how closely you want to hit your desired power targets for each interval. It\u2019s just like Zwift but you can ride at a sustained specific slope as long as you want and more easily control your power output. ERG mode does not work well on short intervals, how short depends on the trainer you own but some where around 10\u201315 seconds are as short as works well in ERG mode, in that range it\u2019s better to manually control your power with slope mode. [[2023-01-01-smart-slopes-779c74a0c921.md|Read more here]]\n\n**Resistance Mode**\n\nResistance mode is like slope mode but instead up to a 25 degree slope (very rare to do 25%, 3\u201310% is more common) you specify resistance from 1\u2013100%. The actual power output depends on cadence and your specific model of trainer. We do not have any automatic resistance mode but really slope and resistance are the same and slope mode is more standardly used. You can switch from allowing switching Slope mode to using Resistance mode in our Other Settings.\n\n**Heart Rate\u200a\u2014\u200aHR Mode**\n\nHeart rate mode is a very specific mode that automatically controls your trainers power target (ERG mode) based on your target heart rate. If your heart rate is too high it will lower your power target and the opposite if it is too low. It moves very slowly giving your heart rate time to catch up. This works as a limit not an average. Meaning if you say 120 limit we try to keep it just under 120. Some people like ERG for the warmup and HR for some good Zone 2 HR based training.\n\nYou can see in this video you can design workouts that atomically switches in and out of any of these modes.\n\n[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK87_Seu658)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3250, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fcda7486-408a-448a-839e-c2a948bf0186": {"__data__": {"id_": "fcda7486-408a-448a-839e-c2a948bf0186", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2024-03-18-the-benefits-of-a-polarized-approach-to-cycling-training-0da0417cac5f", "title": "The Benefits Of A Polarized Approach To Cycling Training", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["polarized"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2024-03-18-the-benefits-of-a-polarized-approach-to-cycling-training-0da0417cac5f.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c9a6d44a-daa0-4b55-8937-cf99463069d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2024-03-18-the-benefits-of-a-polarized-approach-to-cycling-training-0da0417cac5f", "title": "The Benefits Of A Polarized Approach To Cycling Training", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["polarized"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2024-03-18-the-benefits-of-a-polarized-approach-to-cycling-training-0da0417cac5f.md"}, "hash": "c8b364300f3f1b407c7a9b897cce1167f6c476f612a73e2e21ae067676adf169", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7083994c-b344-4c89-a3b1-0bf01cd13823", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8cec2b48f27605d362afc396add0c27fbc779d0e04ba74d3dc5717170b62c77f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Endurance sports demand discipline, dedication, and a well-structured training regimen to achieve optimal performance. Over the years, various training methodologies have been employed to help cyclists reach their full potential. One of the more effective and promising approaches to cycling training is the polarized training method. This method emphasizes the extreme ends of intensity: low-intensity, steady-state rides and high-intensity, interval-based workouts. In this article, we will explore why taking a more polarized approach to cycling training is beneficial.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-18rRLiSGI6ZCtsrMBi-ZIAA.jpg)\n\n**Improved Aerobic Base**\n\nThe foundation of any successful cyclist is a robust aerobic capacity. Low-intensity, steady-state rides are essential for building and maintaining this foundation. A polarized training approach allocates a significant portion of training time to these steady-state rides, allowing cyclists to develop a solid aerobic base. This base enhances the body\u2019s ability to transport and utilize oxygen, which is crucial for prolonged efforts in endurance cycling events.\n\n**Enhanced Recovery**\n\nOne of the main benefits of a polarized approach is that it includes low-intensity workouts that promote active recovery. After intense training sessions or competitions, it\u2019s vital for cyclists to recover effectively to avoid overtraining and injury. Low-intensity rides allow athletes to flush out metabolic waste products, reduce muscle soreness, and maintain active recovery, ensuring they are ready for high-intensity workouts when needed.\n\n**Greater Fat Utilization**\n\nThese low intensity efforts offer to improve a cyclist\u2019s ability to utilize fat as a fuel source. This is a valuable skill, especially in long-distance events, where carbohydrate stores can become depleted. By increasing fat utilization, cyclists can conserve glycogen stores for later in the race, improving their overall endurance.\n\n**Time-Efficient Training**\n\nCyclists often face time constraints due to work, family, and other commitments. By focusing on two distinct intensity zones, cyclists can achieve more efficient improvements. This time efficiency can make it easier for athletes to balance training with other responsibilities.\n\n**Mental Toughness**\n\nCycling is as much a mental game as it is a physical one. High-intensity intervals push cyclists to their limits and demand mental resilience. If you love hard intervals then sure jump right in, but we believe a slow build up to these longer sessions of hard intervals will produce great results and are a smarter, safer way to train.\n\nIf you want to race or beat your friends on fast group rides then the ability to embrace discomfort and continue pushing through the pain is essential for success. A polarized approach forces cyclists to confront these challenges regularly, helping them develop mental toughness that can be applied to races and other aspects of life.\n\n**Long-Term Sustainability**\n\nThe polarized approach promotes long-term sustainability in cycling training. By balancing low and high-intensity sessions, it reduces the risk of burnout, overtraining, and injuries. This sustainability allows athletes to maintain a consistent training regimen over months and years, steadily improving their performance and achieving their long-term cycling goals.\n\n**Performance Gains**\n\nUltimately, the primary goal of any training approach is improved performance. The polarized method, by developing a robust aerobic base, enhancing fat utilization, and building mental toughness, leads to significant performance gains. Cyclists who adopt this approach often find that they can achieve higher speeds, maintain their power output for longer durations, and consistently reach peak form when it matters most.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe polarized approach to cycling training is not a one-size-fits-all solution, but for many cyclists, it offers a highly effective and efficient way to achieve their goals. By balancing low-intensity, steady-state rides with higher-intensity intervals, this approach promotes an enhanced aerobic base, improved recovery, and long-term sustainability. The mental and physical benefits of a polarized approach can lead to significant performance gains that can propel cyclists to success in their chosen discipline. As with any training method, it is essential to tailor it to individual needs and goals, but for those seeking a proven and balanced approach, polarized training is undoubtedly worth considering.\n\nThe Coach Jack Plan builder in TrainerDay is not exactly the same as traditional polarized training but embraces a process of starting easy and slowly working towards much harder workouts all while maintaining a mostly easy approach to training.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4807, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7083994c-b344-4c89-a3b1-0bf01cd13823": {"__data__": {"id_": "7083994c-b344-4c89-a3b1-0bf01cd13823", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2024-03-18-the-benefits-of-a-polarized-approach-to-cycling-training-0da0417cac5f", "title": "The Benefits Of A Polarized Approach To Cycling Training", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["polarized"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2024-03-18-the-benefits-of-a-polarized-approach-to-cycling-training-0da0417cac5f.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c9a6d44a-daa0-4b55-8937-cf99463069d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2024-03-18-the-benefits-of-a-polarized-approach-to-cycling-training-0da0417cac5f", "title": "The Benefits Of A Polarized Approach To Cycling Training", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["polarized"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2024-03-18-the-benefits-of-a-polarized-approach-to-cycling-training-0da0417cac5f.md"}, "hash": "c8b364300f3f1b407c7a9b897cce1167f6c476f612a73e2e21ae067676adf169", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fcda7486-408a-448a-839e-c2a948bf0186", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2024-03-18-the-benefits-of-a-polarized-approach-to-cycling-training-0da0417cac5f", "title": "The Benefits Of A Polarized Approach To Cycling Training", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["polarized"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2024-03-18-the-benefits-of-a-polarized-approach-to-cycling-training-0da0417cac5f.md"}, "hash": "c9551075824535be27df9aba83f305e03eff6d0c6d0d005ed720f6a2268f6fef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "**Conclusion**\n\nThe polarized approach to cycling training is not a one-size-fits-all solution, but for many cyclists, it offers a highly effective and efficient way to achieve their goals.

And you can further adjust your power to speed ratio to more closely match your distances outside using Drag Coefficient below.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-12yCvBOMMAtNSH-fVSxrpJg.png)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1343, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3dd75916-dfa8-453e-88aa-fa799267f3ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "3dd75916-dfa8-453e-88aa-fa799267f3ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2024-03-08-i-am-time-crunched-our-new-training-app-906ea8b4876", "title": "session", "category": "Features", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["time-crunched", "about-trainerday"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2024-03-08-i-am-time-crunched-our-new-training-app-906ea8b4876.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cc2b9525-736d-413f-a4e5-beb685372949", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2024-03-08-i-am-time-crunched-our-new-training-app-906ea8b4876", "title": "session", "category": "Features", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["time-crunched", "about-trainerday"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2024-03-08-i-am-time-crunched-our-new-training-app-906ea8b4876.md"}, "hash": "3e45dc61cfe5ab86731dec91df8c0bdb367e53dfe1fa57c3e28d162b1dae78df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cd30ee2b-f0a8-4ce4-8d9e-00ed14e5b517", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a65ebe6f6419bc33ca03d6545ab985e2adcf8554b0ee137a1fc9256dfa23e254", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Forum Analysis Pipeline - Current Session\n\n## What We Accomplished\n\n### 1.

They are just poorly optimized for anaerobic workouts. It\u2019s funny for me to say that since we have a website with 5000+ FTP based workouts. Many or most of these workouts have at least one anaerobic interval.\n\nThe anaerobic workouts on the TrainerDay site do provide benefits but if you take your training seriously, you might want to stop using generic FTP based anaerobic workouts and move to something more individualized. We are offering a new feature to make this simple.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0WMKgtVgSB5QqRE8V.jpg)\n\nYes, there is a relationship between FTP and anerobic workouts, but not a strong enough relationship to consider it personalized like they aerobic brother. Because FTP does not individualize these workouts for you, most anaerobic workouts on almost all the platforms will either be too hard or too easy to maximize your potential and save you time.\n\nFor most cyclists aerobic training is 90% of the battle, so **FTP based aerobic training TRUELY IS the most important part.** Many of us can just stop reading now and keep doing our FTP based aerobic focused workouts and we will be fine. MTB, cyclocross and many other riders that rely on sprinting power better keep reading.\n\nOk, for those of you still here, the good news is, once you know your W\u2019 it only takes a few minutes in TrainerDay to customize anaerobic workouts to match your fitness profile. You can easily clean the water out of your gas.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0Wp8XKIfqHQH-nd0P.jpg)\n\n### Anaerobic training, intensities and durations.\n\nLet\u2019s state this another way. Trying to determine how much weight to lift at the gym based on FTP is not likely the best approach. That is an extreme case example, but I am just saying don\u2019t base your anaerobic training on an aerobic measurement. This is not me saying this, this is many years of science saying the relationship between the two is very loose.\n\nPros usually have both large aerobic and anaerobic abilities. For everyone else, the relationship between the two is not so clear. Great sprinters have large anaerobic ability and some cyclists have very little anaerobic capacity.\n\nSo why do we and everyone determine your anaerobic training intervals, based on your FTP? Because it is simple and in roughly in the ball-park.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0NIgIg17aIicTYK50.jpg)\n\n### To prove what is wrong, let\u2019s look at an\u00a0example\n\nYou can ignore below and just see the charts on the right\n\n**We have two riders**  \na) Rider-A with a 200-watt FTP  \nb) Rider-B with a 300-watt FTP\n\nBoth riders have the same anaerobic work capacity, their W\u2019 = 20kJ. These riders with the same W\u2019 but a different FTP should not be doing the same anaerobic workouts **based on percent of FTP.**\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0VIhh0NIJTULKh2GA.jpg)\n\nLet me prove that with a slight amount of MATH (I know that is a 4-letter word). This is all based on established science. W\u2019 is a fixed amount of energy that you have above your FTP. You can do a fixed # of watts for a fixed amount of time. Also, to clarify 1 joule is 1 watt for 1 second and a kJ is 1000 joules.\n\nFor Rider-A 180% of FTP is 360 watts (FTP+160 watts)  \nFor Rider-B 180% of FTP is 540 watts (FTP+240 watts)\n\nSo a 2-minute interval will bring Rider-A to a perfect failure point at 2-minutes (120-seconds) 120\\*160w = 19.2kJ of energy out of his 20kJ.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3595, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c352aad-d919-462f-9f8f-d2da98e58957": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c352aad-d919-462f-9f8f-d2da98e58957", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb", "title": "Why Ftp Based Training Is Half Wrong", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["w-prime", "web-app"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ecf6aac6-b8e3-4101-8a4f-d79be38524e0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb", "title": "Why Ftp Based Training Is Half Wrong", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["w-prime", "web-app"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md"}, "hash": "5d9faf2623adca76a4d17c21e8ae7d92f09adc6d5ea5b3be5985574919493b89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b62e1b33-88a9-4544-a1a7-a2f56fdc93cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb", "title": "Why Ftp Based Training Is Half Wrong", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["w-prime", "web-app"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md"}, "hash": "72c5bd3cf09d4dd48e9ce5b203b2289352b4c83b0fc268d7be0c5bd2d4e2efe6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This is all based on established science.

When you are talking about multiple intervals with rests between them it\u2019s more complex. This is where W\u2019Bal saves the day.

In this post, we\u2019ll go through all the other types of indoor trainers, tell you the benefits and drawbacks of each, and how to choose between one and the other.\n\n![Tax Neo\u200a\u2014\u200aDirect Drive Trainer](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0rv3RTf1m3B2zZ-3q.jpg)\n\n**Smart Bikes\u200a\u2014**\u200aA smart bike is a purpose-built indoor bike only meant for indoor riding. These contraptions are smooth and silent, and usually cost $2500\u20133500. A smart bike looks a bit like a future bicycle without wheels. Some versions look a bit like spin bikes (more on those below), with a heavier front flywheel rather than a rear flywheel.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0fNl2PsD2m9Z-5h1y.jpg)\n\nSome smart bikes can tilt up or down, to simulate riding up climbs or down descents, just like the Wahoo KICKR Climb or Elite Rizer. Smart bikes are virtually silent, super smooth, and ultra-comfortable. Instead of normal gearing with a derailleur, chain rings, and a cassette, a smart bike\u2019s shifting is all virtual, which means that when you click the shifter, the smart bike changes the resistance virtually, rather than physically shifting a mechanical gear. This makes shifting super smooth and quieter than ever. You can also adjust your gearing preferences to fit exactly what you like. It\u2019s an unparalleled experience. **For the ultimate indoor training machine, go with an indoor smart bike.**\n\n**Spin Bikes\u200a\u2014**\u200aSpin bikes are more basic versions of indoor smart bikes, but they are usually designed for the general population rather than experienced cyclists. Peloton bikes, for examples, feature wide and tall handlebars, with an upright riding position that is much more upright than the traditional road cycling position. This puts less strain on the arms and lower back, which is much better for beginner or recreational riders.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-06-h6ak11ygWKtUES.jpg)\n\nWhile spin bikes are significantly cheaper than indoor smart bikes, they are much less capable. Most spin bikes do not include a power meter, and you\u2019ll have to adjust the resistance manually, sometimes with a turn knob on the top tube.\n\nOverall, spin bikes are generally used for spin bike classes, or guided group workouts, rather than individual rides, workouts, or virtual races. Spin bike classes are instructor-led classes that typically involve pumping music, motivating leaders, and effort-based (rather than power-based) interval training. These classes are completely different from the feel and workout you would get on an app like Zwift or TrainerDay.\n\nThat said, some spin bikes can connect to third-party apps such as Zwift, but most spin bikes are dumb trainers, in the way that they cannot connect to third-party apps or measure power on their own. Peloton bikes, for example, fall into this category, so you won\u2019t be able to ride this bike on Zwift. For the higher-end spin bikes such as a Peloton, this is a big letdown because it really limits your training options on an expensive piece of indoor cycling equipment. A moderately priced Schwinn ic4 is an example of a spin bike that has a built in power meter although it should be noted that the accuracy is questionable on most spin bikes.\n\n**Rollers\u200a\u2014**\u200aRollers are the final type of indoor cycling equipment, and these are exactly as they sound. Balance your bike on top of the three spinning drums (i.e. rollers), and start pedaling. You\u2019ll have to practice, as riding on your bike on rollers comes with a steep learning curve.

However, once you get the hang of it, roller-riding is a unique and engaging experience.\u00a0  \nWhen riding on rollers, it almost feels like you\u2019re riding on the open road. This is because you have to balance on top of the rollers, and slightly steer to keep your bike going in a straight line. It is even more difficult to get out of the saddle\u200a\u2014\u200abut once you get the hang of it, riding rollers is fun!\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0Iq8HTr36dEicYZgV.jpg)\n\nOne of the biggest benefit of riding rollers is the realistic ride feel, which not only feels better but also trains your body in a more life-like way. All of your stabilizer muscles will be activated while riding on rollers since you\u2019ll have to balance and keep riding in a straight line. These muscles can be lost or weakened with too much indoor trainer riding, so when you return to riding outside after a winter spent riding the indoor trainer, you can develop back problems, tightness, and pain. You\u2019ll never need to worry about that if you ride on rollers every few days in the winter.\n\nThe best part is that most rollers are fairly cheap\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can often find a pair for less than $200. There are some higher-end options, and even smart rollers that measure power. These rollers are a bit clunky at the moment, and don\u2019t measure power super accurately\u200a\u2014\u200abut they are full to use. There are even some smart rollers that can adjust the gradient up to +/-7%. I\u2019m not sure how that actually works, but I know that it does. For a fun, affordable, and engaging indoor training option, rollers are the #1 choice.\n\nWritten by Zach Nehr", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3113, "end_char_idx": 5367, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7aa601ae-cd25-48e1-aa87-24c89e97c4bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "7aa601ae-cd25-48e1-aa87-24c89e97c4bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-using-trainerday-workouts-in-other-platforms-f927661d8550", "title": "Using Trainerday Workouts In Other Platforms", "category": "Features", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["integrations", "export"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-using-trainerday-workouts-in-other-platforms-f927661d8550.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85aa650c-426c-4d01-a40f-02a783ccc8c5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-using-trainerday-workouts-in-other-platforms-f927661d8550", "title": "Using Trainerday Workouts In Other Platforms", "category": "Features", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["integrations", "export"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-using-trainerday-workouts-in-other-platforms-f927661d8550.md"}, "hash": "eeffb55d4fcb4ad9eeb83818ba5af73d25d3dd6a221ea78513647c89ace3fdd2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "There are many ways you can use TrainerDay workouts and plans in other platforms.

This means if you want to get stronger you need to go to failure or at least close to failure to tell your body it needs to repair itself and get stronger so next time this same exercise is easy.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0xYyOCvibyEmEczap.jpg)\n\n### How many intervals should I be\u00a0doing?\n\nEveryone knows that they have a limited amount of time, that they can sustain a hard-effort. We can clarify hard-effort as anything above your FTP. But how much time is that exactly? Meaning should I do four 2-minutes intervals @ 120% or maybe they should be 2:15 not 2-minutes. Since each athlete has a unique amount of anaerobic capacity (W\u2019). You should train with custom intervals matched to your personal W\u2019. You can hunt by trial and error, or you can use this cool TrainerDay feature called W\u2019 Balance (W\u2019Bal). This same feature has been in GoldenCheetah for a long time, but we feel we simplified it.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0ysY46bOrDhfas0UX.jpg)\n\n### Finding the perfect interval\u00a0workouts\n\nThis is a fairly deep subject but just starting with the basics is a huge step forward and something that many workout authors overlook. So for this article we are talking about intervals above your FTP. You want to tax your anaerobic system with just the right stimulus.\n\nThe basic idea is when you are above FTP your anaerobic work capacity (AWC or W\u2019) diminishes. Many people also call this \u201cburning matches.\u201d You only have so many matches to burn. Although when you drop below your FTP your W\u2019 recovers, or the match book fills back up, slowly. The great news is we have added W\u2019Bal to our workout creator.\n\n### 5000+ Is Too Many\u00a0Choices\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0WVmL4pI8fTbu_xpU.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0aQCWEwrcemsHW-_X.png)\n\nI would like to point out, I don\u2019t feel a 10-minute warm-up is enough, it should be closer to 20. It just improved the visibility in this example.\n\n### How to use the W\u2019Bal Calculator\n\nTurn on the W\u2019Bal feature. Enter your FTP or if you know it your CP in the CP box. Enter your W\u2019 ([how to calculate](https://trainerday.com/how-to-calculate-your-critical-power-cp-and-w/)) and you are good to go.\n\nThe red line shows you\u2019re predicted remaining energy and you can see at the end of this set of intervals your remaining energy is at the bottom this W\u2019Bal predicts you are completly fatigued at the end of the intervals. Perfect.\n\nMany scientific studies have proven the validity of these formulas.\n\nIn this example on the left, if you have a W\u2019 of 20kJ, and a FTP of 200, with those intervals, you will burn all your matches. The interesting thing is if you had a 300w FTP, you could not complete this workout (read [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|this article]] to find out why). Another benefit is that designing workouts that you know you should be able to finish can help inspire you to push a little farther. If you make this last interval a little farther and you can finish it (i.e. you can go below zero) that frequently means your W\u2019 or possibly FTP is likely a little higher than you thought.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3341, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5a37c91-bcf7-4c80-8df0-7590c47bd0aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5a37c91-bcf7-4c80-8df0-7590c47bd0aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-designing-the-perfect-interval-workout-using-wbal-missing-videos-20a0c039dfa0", "title": "Designing The Perfect Interval Workout Using W'bal", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-designing-the-perfect-interval-workout-using-wbal-missing-videos-20a0c039dfa0.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "53420500-0af8-4d9a-8e94-1d91917f56b2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-designing-the-perfect-interval-workout-using-wbal-missing-videos-20a0c039dfa0", "title": "Designing The Perfect Interval Workout Using W'bal", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-designing-the-perfect-interval-workout-using-wbal-missing-videos-20a0c039dfa0.md"}, "hash": "7f042fa61b5c4734562c631957dd255cb14ac8c50501a4aba8d1adbcda1f845b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ad791cd-d3c6-4a4e-83dd-3c6cfb987c63", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-designing-the-perfect-interval-workout-using-wbal-missing-videos-20a0c039dfa0", "title": "Designing The Perfect Interval Workout Using W'bal", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-designing-the-perfect-interval-workout-using-wbal-missing-videos-20a0c039dfa0.md"}, "hash": "78b16eb771cf81ca4dbf179b345a8566373ea73890acbd60c985627e775ab2f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Perfect.\n\nMany scientific studies have proven the validity of these formulas.\n\nIn this example on the left, if you have a W\u2019 of 20kJ, and a FTP of 200, with those intervals, you will burn all your matches.

Simple as that.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0vx44OG0LZWXBCQd3.jpg)\n\nBut to have an enjoyable experience on the indoor trainer, you need much more than that. You\u2019ll need entertainment, engagement, cooling tools, food, and water. Without all of the aforementioned accessories, you might as well be staring at a wall and sitting in a pile of sweat. Not fun.\u00a0  \nThrough years of indoor training experience, here are some of the most important additions, accessories, and necessities to add to your indoor training space.\n\n**Fans\u200a\u2014**\u200aA powerful fan is the single-most important addition to your indoor training setup. Without it, you will be left forming a puddle of sweat, suffering in the heat and humidity of an indoor space.\n\nMany of us take the cool breeze for granted when we\u2019re riding outside. But in reality, this breeze (as fast as we\u2019re traveling plus additional wind speed) is what keeps us cool when we\u2019re out on the bike. But on the indoor trainer, that wind and its cooling effect are entirely lost.\n\nA fan pointed at your face, chest, or back is critical for not only improving your enjoyment, but also your indoor cycling performance. Heightened core body temperature is one of the first limiting factors of human performance, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to stay cool on the trainer. We recommend a large, industrial-sized fan for indoor riding; and if possible, use multiple fans.\n\nThe best indoor cycling setups have one fan pointed straight at the rider, with two smaller fans on each side, and even one blowing on their back.\n\nThere are some branded indoor trainer fans that you can buy such as the Wahoo KICKR Headwind, but you can also make due with any other type of fan. Keep it on the floor, mount it on the wall, or place it on your trainer desk\u200a\u2014\u200awhatever gets that cool breeze onto your body is best.\n\n**Towels\u200a\u2014**\u200aIt should go without saying that you will also want a towel and or sweatbands when riding indoors. With increased core body temperature comes increased perspiration, and sweat is not only unpleasant, but it can also damage your bike. I have seen riders sweat through their handlebar tape, ruin their shifters, and clog up their brakes. And I have even seen riders fill up their headset with crusted salt, and short-circuit their electronic shifting with dripping sweat.\n\nWhen riding the indoor trainer, make sure to have a large towel at the ready to wipe excess sweat from your hands, arms, and forehead, and use sweatbands on your head and wrists if possible. Don\u2019t worry about looking too dorky either\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re only riding inside, so no one will see you. Plus, you\u2019re putting in the hard work and getting stronger!\n\n**Trainer Mat\u200a\u2014**\u200aYou\u2019re going to be sweating a lot on the indoor trainer, and no matter how many fans, towels, or sweatbands you have, you\u2019ll never be able to catch all of it. Some sweat will inevitably end up on the floor, and depending on where you\u2019re riding, that can become a huge problem.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the basement on a concrete floor, dripping sweat won\u2019t be that big of a deal. But if you\u2019re temporarily setting up in the office, in the corner of the bedroom, or especially in the living room, you don\u2019t want to leave your sweat and stench all over the floor.\n\nTrainer mats typically cost less than $100, but you can also use an oversized yoga mat, rubber flooring from the hardware store, or an old carpet. Whatever absorbs your sweat and can be easily rolled up and stored is going to be your best option.\n\n**Trainer desk\u200a\u2014**\u200aWhile it is not a necessity to have a trainer desk, it is almost impossible to enjoy your ride without somewhere to put all of your stuff.

Whatever absorbs your sweat and can be easily rolled up and stored is going to be your best option.\n\n**Trainer desk\u200a\u2014**\u200aWhile it is not a necessity to have a trainer desk, it is almost impossible to enjoy your ride without somewhere to put all of your stuff. That includes your phone, computer, laptop, or tablet, plus your headphones, water bottles, nutrition, and towels. And if you want to add in some entertainment, you\u2019ll need somewhere to put a TV, laptop, tablet, or monitor as well.\n\nThere are a few purpose-made indoor cycling desks on the market (such as the Wahoo KICKR Desk); and while they are near-perfect in terms of function, they are quite expensive. You can certainly use a normal desk, a standing desk, a windowsill, or even a barstool. Just make sure that your desk is stable, especially if you perch expensive electronics on top of it.\n\n**Rocker Plate\u200a\u2014**\u200aIt has become an increasingly popular trend to perch your indoor trainer setup on top of some sort of rocker plate, or a moveable platform that helps add dynamic movement to the base of your trainer. Take the Saris MP1 Nfinity Platform, for example.\n\nThis piece of equipment attaches to your indoor trainer and your bike, simulating fore and after movement as well as some side-to-side movement. While the precise physics of different platforms vary, they all add an element of micro-movement and stabilization patterns that are similar to outdoor riding.\n\nOutdoor riding, of course, is much more dynamic than indoor riding which is much more static. When we ride outside, we are constantly balancing the bike as we pedal along. We lean into corners and get out of the saddle, and adjust our position whether we\u2019re in a headwind or riding in a bunch. The indoor trainer is completely limited to pedaling, and platform pundits argue that a significant amount of energy is lost in the static movement (or lack thereof) of indoor riding.\n\nWhile the Saris Nfinity Platform is quite expensive, you can find cheaper rocker plates for less than half the price. Some trainers\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as the Wahoo KICKR\u200a\u2014\u200aeven have movement built into their feet, such as the KICKR Axis Action Feet which cost less than $100 on their own. If you\u2019re a dedicated indoor rider who spends lots of miles on the indoor trainer, it\u2019s worth looking into a rocker plate or some kind that can make your indoor training experience much more enjoyable, powerful, and sustainable.\n\n**Wireless Headphones\u200a\u2014**\u200aOne of the biggest upgrades I ever made to my indoor training space was swapping a pair or wireless Bluetooth headphones for my old wired pair. The different was stark, and it completely changed by comfort levels with indoor training. On top of all that, the upgrade cost me less than $50.\n\nYou might not realize how annoying wired headphones are until you try wireless ones; but once you make the switch, it\u2019s almost impossible to go back. You\u2019ll never need to worry about bumping or pulling on the cord, accidentally unplugging your headphones or dragging your entire setup to the floor, or sweating through your headphones during a hard workout. Go wireless.\n\nWritten by Zach Nehr", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3066, "end_char_idx": 6616, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8abb68ac-cff3-484f-b970-9bbe15acb1ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "8abb68ac-cff3-484f-b970-9bbe15acb1ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-recovery-system-training-what-ddec372e34cd", "title": "Recovery System Training: What You Need to Know", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["recovery"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-recovery-system-training-what-ddec372e34cd.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d625f2e-245d-4e80-82a1-14ab0ba6f78f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-recovery-system-training-what-ddec372e34cd", "title": "Recovery System Training: What You Need to Know", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["recovery"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-recovery-system-training-what-ddec372e34cd.md"}, "hash": "dbf02f382f1e9fba42fb38ead00fa42e2ac8745e0ee4aee9169dfe4d6bec3eac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "287ea3eb-8e58-4b28-be94-5f0346c4df6f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1dec678d4ede783afcb443cdefad3e6a4809cf3be3cf3387394c9e7b6050765a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "I don\u2019t know about you. But, I have been looking at recovery wrong! Not completely wrong, but what I now believe is was an incomplete view. We are huge proponents of quality recovery at TrainerDay. At first glance this article might appear to be a diversion from that. Let\u2019s get started.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that for most athletes sleep the most important aspect of recovery. Diet is important as well. Most of us recognize we can\u2019t go hard everyday forever. In many cases, older athletes break down faster than younger ones. But did you know that recovery adaption is trainable? What does that even mean? Begin your \u201cRecovery Adaption Training Program.\u201d\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1SEE4bl2PaeNRObgK-MKVEw.png)\n\nWe know pro cyclists can ride 30 hours a week. Many of us that have tried doing large amounts of training and start breaking down. So pros are super human, right? Well, yes, but there may be more to recovery than they have led us to believe or maybe we are just looking at it wrong.\n\nSo in the sports world, we have a lot of blanket rules. We also know that there is exceptions to every rule. We all wonder if we are the exception\u00a0:)\n\n**Strength gurus and trainable recovery**\n\nSo I have seen coaches directly discussing \u201crecovery adaption training,\u201d although the strength world is starting to bring it up. The cycling world, talks a lot about recovering more/better/faster but not improving recovery adaption itself.\n\nIn weight training, a common blanket rule is don\u2019t train the same muscle group two days in a row. Many times, coaches suggest not to do one muscle group more than once a week. Recent reputable sources are clarifying that it is might not be good advice in many cases. Some of the strongest guys in the past did 5+ days a week targeting the same muscles.\n\nI recently read a brilliant book by a serious genius called \u201cSquat Every Day.\u201d The squat is the most demanding strength movement and so this concept really goes against \u201cthe rules.\u201d Another guru in weight training is Mark Rippetoe of Starting Strength that has millions of views on his YouTube channel, says beginners should only do 3 sets because they recover faster and can train again sooner (in 48 to 72 hours). So why don\u2019t we take that farther and see what happens with 1-heavy set a day every day?\n\nHere is a somewhat comical video. I like this guy Allan Thrall. He is very much an expert in strength training. Here is he talking about trainable recovery.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfBizaDfvU8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfBizaDfvU8)\n\n**My experience in trainable recovery**\n\nAfter 45 and now at 56, I break down rather quickly, so my body requires lots of recovery. My sleep goes to hell, injuries and sickness crop up and I feel extra tired\u2026 My HRV tanks, my Garmin and/or Whoop say \u201cback off buddy.\u201d This especially occurs with regular anaerobic efforts. But!!! But something changed recently. I don\u2019t require as much recovery. Yes, I am sleeping pretty good and my diet is acceptable, but something is different.\n\nWe are getting into what seems to be an unexplored territory of science, or at least looking at it a different way. I asked a top science based cycling Coach Andrea Morelli what he thinks. His response was, \u201cIn the human body, everything is trainable. So yes, recovery should be trainable.\u201d I don\u2019t mean recovering faster. This is a different focus. This means training my body to require less recovery. It\u2019s hard to differentiate the two, but the way you approach them is very different.\n\nSo what am I saying here? Recovery adaption training is an uncharted territory but stands to provide significant benefits for us non-elite athletes. Beginners and masters athlete likely stand the most to gain.\n\n**Your Recovery Adaption Training Plan**\n\nBefore embarking on this journey, I suggest you make sure you have high-quality processes and self-awareness to know if you when you are heading down the ***over training*** path.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3977, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "287ea3eb-8e58-4b28-be94-5f0346c4df6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "287ea3eb-8e58-4b28-be94-5f0346c4df6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-recovery-system-training-what-ddec372e34cd", "title": "Recovery System Training: What You Need to Know", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["recovery"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-recovery-system-training-what-ddec372e34cd.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d625f2e-245d-4e80-82a1-14ab0ba6f78f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-recovery-system-training-what-ddec372e34cd", "title": "Recovery System Training: What You Need to Know", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["recovery"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-recovery-system-training-what-ddec372e34cd.md"}, "hash": "dbf02f382f1e9fba42fb38ead00fa42e2ac8745e0ee4aee9169dfe4d6bec3eac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8abb68ac-cff3-484f-b970-9bbe15acb1ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-recovery-system-training-what-ddec372e34cd", "title": "Recovery System Training: What You Need to Know", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["recovery"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-recovery-system-training-what-ddec372e34cd.md"}, "hash": "700a8a245f63027f03a1ea82ea3eb06fa8b774953e09faeda379178c2101d097", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We are getting into what seems to be an unexplored territory of science, or at least looking at it a different way.

We could call this active recovery, but the mindset of this is not to recover more/faster, you want to do that too, but the thinking behind this plan is to require less recovery. Ultimately recovering faster or requiring less recovery might end up at the same destination. A stronger better you.\n\nNext, I will create a follow-up article on ideas of how to kick start your recovery adaption training program.

I should say it\u2019s not the worst thing but frequently it drives the wrong behavior and can take the fun out of cycling.\n\nFor many of us seeing progress is inspirational and keeps us motivated. That is one big benefit of FTP improvements. We think being motivated or at least consistent is the most important factor in performance cycling and health in general.\n\nThe bad part of putting so much focus on FTP is a few things. When you start to see FTP based progress, you think this is the best training there is. Hard/long sweet spot training can show some great results in short term FTP improvements for example. The problem is FTP is just a test, although in general your FTP or FTP watts per kilogram does relate to performance, specific goal based training and a wide variety of training produces better overall seasonal results. Also it\u2019s very important to look at seasonal improvements not just short term FTP boosts. If you are continuously trying to boost your FTP, it will flatline. I think almost everyone realizes that periodization is important but then many don\u2019t do a very good job of seasonal variety. Your FTP should drop down a bit and then build back up to new highs.\n\nAlso FTP tests have an anaerobic contribution so even short term sprint work will improve a ramp test for example but is likely not doing that much for your aerobic system. Aerobic changes come slowly over a long period of time.\n\nAlso when people are focused on FTP improvement, doing Zone 2 heart rate is very scary. They can feel they are not as strong and trying to do sustained threshold feels painful, oh my I am losing everything. But those that have the mental power to make it through a late fall / early winter of Zone 2 come out in peak form in the late spring with tons of motivation and realize this is the way forward.\n\nAnyway, this is all very personal and depends on your circumstances and goals. FTP focused improvements can make sense.\n\nTaking the cycling camp approach of a short 10 day boot camp period with doing cycling workouts everyday can cause some rapid boosts but this approach is not sustainable long term.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2223, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "512fdd5d-d6e9-494e-8a4d-b32dced1eadd": {"__data__": {"id_": "512fdd5d-d6e9-494e-8a4d-b32dced1eadd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-wbal-says-easy-i-say-it-s-impossible-ca703ed79fd1", "title": "W'bal Says Easy, I Say It's Impossible", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Geek-Out", "tags": ["w-prime"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-wbal-says-easy-i-say-it-s-impossible-ca703ed79fd1.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d0ccdf87-d1e7-4c22-94e6-d7d019980983", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-wbal-says-easy-i-say-it-s-impossible-ca703ed79fd1", "title": "W'bal Says Easy, I Say It's Impossible", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Geek-Out", "tags": ["w-prime"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-wbal-says-easy-i-say-it-s-impossible-ca703ed79fd1.md"}, "hash": "aae0ca0d30a22eda59ab63bd526ec9c03553efa43148b5efbf799e36084f4cef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "#### Basically no one can do 60-minutes at\u00a0FTP\n\nIn theory, 60-minutes is possible, but in reality almost no one will unless their FTP is set too low.

Be adaptable**\n\nAs athletes, we all love a training program.\n\nThere is nothing better than when someone with expertise, knowledge, experience, and confidence that comes along to sweep the stress away. They provide you with a detailed step-by-step schedule to get the most out of your 24 hrs each day. They listen to your goals, and showing you exactly how to get there.\n\nI always found training to be the easiest part of being a professional cyclist because it felt like all the pressure was off me. If I just did what I was told to do in training each day, I couldn\u2019t go wrong in that specific arena. So it was a large chunk of the unknown taken away from me, and I could just focus on the task at hand.\n\nBUT: What happens when sh\\*t happens? Because as we know all too well\u2026 sh\\*t does happen. You get sick. You crash. Races get cancelled. Schedules change. Off the bike, in real life, stuff happens that is out of your control\u2026 and suddenly the perfectly curated dream plan doesn\u2019t look so perfect.\n\nI used to lose my marbles when things went wrong. I thought it meant I would fail at the task at hand. What I didn\u2019t know was\u200a\u2014\u200athe less you stress about the uncontrollable factors, the more energy you will have, and the better your performance will actually be.\n\nI watched many pro athletes ride around cool as a cucumber when things were absolutely NOT going to plan and yet I felt like the whole world was collapsing around me as I tried to make sure every minute of my training session was accounted for, and guess who were the ones winning races? I\u2019ll give you a hint\u200a\u2014\u200ait wasn\u2019t me.\n\nSo what I learnt to do was apply the rule of thirds:\n\nOne third of the time, I was training pretty perfectly, hitting power targets, feeling fast and ready to race.\n\nThe next third of the time, I was getting it done, but it could be better.\n\nAnd the last third of the time, I felt pretty crappy and maybe missed a training session altogether because of some unforeseen circumstances.\n\nThe key here is to NOT self-berate when things don\u2019t flow exactly the way you like them to.\n\nInstead, recognise this as an off day, do what you can to make it count, and let go of control.\n\nTASK: If you\u2019re feeling wound up about some unexpected turn of events. You can release the stress by lying down on the earth (outside is best)\u00a0. Begin consciously breathing deeply into your belly for 5 minutes. Each time you exhale, try to imagine the stress falling away and the tension leaving your body. Feel your muscles relaxing as you bring your awareness to each part of your body. Before you get back up, give yourself permission to have fun by going to do something you love doing, whatever that may be. Give it your full attention.\n\n**2\\. Show up like a pro before you become a pro**\n\nSomething I learned when I was climbing toward the pro ranks. I had to show up like a professional cyclist BEFORE any team would hand me a professional contract.\n\nRegardless of whether you desire to become a professional cyclist, this rule still applies to you. You just adapt it to suit whatever your goals are\u2026\n\nFor example, if you want to win A grade races in your region, show up as THAT version of you BEFORE you win. Meaning, train the way a winning A-grader would train, eat, rest, think, believe, BE the grade winner version of you before you actually win.\n\nWhen you do this, you rearrange your subconscious mind to truly believe you mean business. You no longer just saying you want it, you\u2019re actually showing your body, mind and soul that you are ready to BE it.\n\nThis is a HUGE step toward unlocking your true potential, because the subconscious is running the show for 95% of your life.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3852, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e0e70a0-5cb5-490e-8b83-a9890ff43f5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e0e70a0-5cb5-490e-8b83-a9890ff43f5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-the-5-must-dos-to-get-the-best-out-of-yourself-and-your-bike-3a19b1f9d9c2", "title": "The 5 Must-Do's to Get the Best Out of Yourself and Your Bike", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-the-5-must-dos-to-get-the-best-out-of-yourself-and-your-bike-3a19b1f9d9c2.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e6662014-958f-4b18-94bb-d7a9da75bcdc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-the-5-must-dos-to-get-the-best-out-of-yourself-and-your-bike-3a19b1f9d9c2", "title": "The 5 Must-Do's to Get the Best Out of Yourself and Your Bike", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-the-5-must-dos-to-get-the-best-out-of-yourself-and-your-bike-3a19b1f9d9c2.md"}, "hash": "0f4b84bbfeef2d4d20be140d94dfef27acc2983e5abaf4876dab93bbced2e46b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec05e702-ed9e-491e-94be-89e7d4c36d90", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-the-5-must-dos-to-get-the-best-out-of-yourself-and-your-bike-3a19b1f9d9c2", "title": "The 5 Must-Do's to Get the Best Out of Yourself and Your Bike", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-the-5-must-dos-to-get-the-best-out-of-yourself-and-your-bike-3a19b1f9d9c2.md"}, "hash": "57a5f06ce9f5f97b46abc355cdf832cb4718231052c819f12d78fe669e309a52", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "967a1435-ed09-45af-8fcb-afc2b3fce63c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "81850367742ad03a452af56570bb7a10b300f8afd6a76c5dfe115e1e44a4413e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "I had to show up like a professional cyclist BEFORE any team would hand me a professional contract.\n\nRegardless of whether you desire to become a professional cyclist, this rule still applies to you.

So, if you change that, you change your life pretty rapidly compared to any kind of conscious positive thinking.\n\nThe catch is, in order to show up as the greatest version of you, you must clear out your limitations, wounding and blocks. This is what I call doing the real work.\n\n**3\\. Do the real work**\n\nIn this part, I could write an entire book about on its own because doing the real work is the greatest catalyst of your personal, professional and physical growth there is. You can train the house down as much as you like, but if you\u2019re not doing the real work, say goodbye to your true potential.\n\nWhat is the real work?\n\nEmotional, energetic work. It looks like clearing out any limitations, blocks, and past traumas that are still lodged in your subconscious. Before you label yourself as un-traumatised. We all have trauma (big or little). We all have skeletons in the closet. These unprocessed emotions are causing the flow of your real self to be diminished.\n\nI like to look at these blocks in the same way that we can see \u2018roadblocks\u2019 on a multi-lane freeway. If everything is going well, and there are no roadblocks, you can get from A to B with ease and flow. When there is a subconscious limitation standing in the way. Life and cycling become slow, complicated, and often you reach that gut-sinking point of questioning. Will I ever be able to live the life of my dreams? Of course, that\u2019s if you haven\u2019t already settled for less, which is what most people do.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nLike any journey worth travelling, it\u2019s not simple, it\u2019s not one-size-fits-all, it\u2019s not easy, it\u2019s not for the fainthearted\u2026 but it is the best gift you can ever give yourself because when you embark on a journey of personal growth, self-discovery, healing, whatever you want to call it, you give yourself permission to unravel your real self layer by layer. You become liberated, alive, joyful, fulfilled; you find meaning and purpose that hits your soul like never before; you discover levels of love you haven\u2019t felt before, and the best part is\u200a\u2014\u200ayou realise your limitless nature, and anything is possible.\n\nOkay, sorry I got sidetracked by the magic of this work.\n\nBut the \u2018how\u2019 is really something you only know once you start the process. I will, however, do my best to explain.\n\nTo clear out your subconscious limitations, you need to:\n\n\\- Have willingness and desire to do the real work. No one is going to do it for you, no one is going to drag you across the line. You have to want it.\n\n\\- Gain awareness (find out what your limitations are) which usually occurs when you get hit with a \u2018sign\u2019 from the universe that shows up as an emotional trigger.

You have to want it.\n\n\\- Gain awareness (find out what your limitations are) which usually occurs when you get hit with a \u2018sign\u2019 from the universe that shows up as an emotional trigger.

Follow your passions and desires**\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned this a few times already, but doing what you love deserves its own placeholder in this blog.\n\nHear me when I say this\u200a\u2014\u200ayou will never, ever, ever reach a place of true fulfilment (which we all want) if you aren\u2019t following your genuine passions and desires.\n\nI get it.\n\nThe world tells us to settle\u2026 go to school, get a job, study, get a better job, earn more money, buy a house, make more money to pay off the house, have kids before it\u2019s too late, make more money to afford to have kids, make more money to retire early so you can spend time with the family, make more money to go on holidays in the meantime, work more so you feel worthy of the holidays and early retirement, buy more stuff to compensate for the overwhelming feeling of never having enough and never being enough\u2026 and for a lot of you reading this\u200a\u2014\u200aget a bike to escape it all.\n\nYou ride bikes because you love it, right?\n\nBecause it makes you feel free?\n\nIt helps release the stress and overwhelm of everyday life, and for a moment in time, you feel you\u2019re doing something just for you and not for anyone else. You feel in flow\u2026 it\u2019s one of the greatest moments of your entire week.\n\nBut\u2026 when did cycling become an extra thing you put pressure on yourself to do? When did you stop loving it and feel not enough in this space, too?\n\nI hope these questions are enough to allow you to reflect on the reason you started riding bikes. How riding made you feel, and what joy it gave you in your week\u2026\n\nI invite you to bring THAT intention back into your time on the bike. Even if you are working toward a big goal, bring back the love and the fun you had in the beginning.\n\nThe key with following your passions and desires is that you do it NOW, in the present moment.\n\nRather than waiting for retirement to begin enjoying life, you start now.\n\nHere\u2019s some incentive just in case.\n\nThere\u2019s an influential book by Bronnie Ware called \u201cThe 5 Regrets of the Dying.\u201d As the title suggests, the book is about the biggest regrets of people who are on their deathbed.

How often am I in\n\nlove with life? How often am I doing what I truly adore to do?\u201d\n\nThis is usually the point where people come up with a hundred excuses for why they can\u2019t do what they love. And simply, I call BS. You can do whatever you want to do. The only barrier is yourself. So go back and read the previous section on \u201cdo the real work\u201d to clear out the limitations that are currently blocking you from living the life you truly desire, AKA following your passions and desires.\n\nOnce you have cleared out the limitations, you can finally lead with joy. Even if this is as small as putting your bare feet on the ground at the end of a hard day, or starting your day with a 5 minute dance party in the lounge room\u2026 the small things are the big things and the tiny moments add up to create our whole life. Make it count.\n\nThis leads me into the final \u2018must-do\u2019 of this series.\n\n**5\\. Put Yourself First.**\n\nYOU ALWAYS COME FIRST.\n\nBECAUSE YOU ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN YOUR LIFE.\n\nI don\u2019t care how many kids you have\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t care what your role is at work and how many people you are in charge of\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s a lie. I actually do care about these things. I care about them so much that I go as far as saying that this is the most important piece to the puzzle of getting the best out of yourself.\n\nBecause if you aren\u2019t taking care of yourself, you cannot possibly take care of anybody else.\n\nYou are the cause of the effect of your own reality. And no matter what, no matter how fast or slow you want to go, life is always moving. And what\u2019s happening in your inner world is the key influencer of the direction you are heading.\n\n\u201cAs within, so without.\u201d\n\nNow that you know your external reality is a mirror of your internal state of being, how do you choose to treat yourself?\n\nIf you want to get the best out of yourself (a fun fact that sentence tells you\u200a\u2014\u200awhat you want is already within you), first things first, stop looking outside yourself. It starts with you.\n\nI believe this is the hardest pill to swallow when we choose to embark on a personal development journey.

But the truth is, you hold the key to creating everything you have ever desired, and the only reason that door hasn\u2019t yet been unlocked is because you haven\u2019t taken responsibility to number one\u200a\u2014\u200ado the real work; number two\u200a\u2014\u200afollow your true soul\u2019s passions and desires; and number three\u200a\u2014\u200aput yourself first.\n\nIf you want to make anything great happen in your life, you cannot skip any of these steps.\n\nBut I want to give you some more incentive.

Because sometimes \u2018putting ourselves first\u2019 just isn\u2019t enticing enough to really get the wheels in motion.\n\nSometimes we need to understand the deeper implications of what version of ourselves we are choosing to be. Similar to the way we are the creators of our own life and everything in it\u2026 we are also having an impact on everyone else in our lives whether we like it or not. The ripple effect that you are creating just with your energy alone has the potential to extend across the entire globe. And for the people in your close proximity, this means they are receiving a much higher dose of your impact. In short, you are setting the example in ways you are yet to know.\n\nThink on this\u2026 why do you ride the bike? Apart from because you love it and it\u2019s fun\u200a\u2014\u200alike we mentioned above\u2026 why else?\n\nThere\u2019s some other reason I know there is\u200a\u2014\u200aso what is it?\n\nIt\u2019s something greater than you, right? Something outside of yourself\u2026 You want to make an impact on the world around you in some way\u2026\n\nWhether it\u2019s for your kids, for work, for you partner, for family, for the world at large, or for some other reason\u2026 but you will not create the impact you are capable of creating if you continue to people please, settle for less, not ask for what you want, put your own needs second (or last), devalue yourself by not doing what you say you\u2019re going to do for YOU.\n\nConstantly pushing yourself down to the bottom of the list of to-do\u2019s is a form of self betrayal. Essentially, you are telling yourself \u201cyou don\u2019t matter and you don\u2019t deserve it\u201d. As you can imagine, like any other relationship in life, if you show up this way you\u2019re not going to form a great foundation of self-love. Often we see this surface as limitations such as a low self-trust, self-confidence, self-worth, etc.\n\nOn the opposite end of the scale, when you devote yourself to YOU, you foster a bond with yourself that is built of true, unconditional self-love. And from this place, your capacity to create impact on the world around you is limitless. You don\u2019t have to do more, be more, have more, or prove yourself in any other way. Just by being you, you create a ripple effect that has the power to change lives in magical ways.\n\nPutting yourself first comes in many different shapes and sizes, no matter how big or small the desire is, learning to listen to the whispers from your soul and honouring them is the greatest gift you can give yourself, AND it also makes you go faster (that part is not scientifically proven, yet.)\n\nThe final point I want to make before I sign off is to reframe the way you look at your goals. Often we believe if I reach a certain goal \u201cthen I\u2019ll be happy\u201d and that is absolutely not true. Success on the outside does not change what is happening on the inside. It\u2019s not the external success that you truly desire, it\u2019s the feeling you believe the success will bring you.

Click +\u200a\u2014\u200ain our app to set your target\n\nSo that is the easiest part. Just like determining your FTP. For Zone 2 training you should do a test to determine your target heart rate.

Because accuracy **does NOT affect your training** it does not need to be perfectly accurate but will improve your experience a little by setting the right scaling in our app. Also at the bottom we show your target % of threshold rather than your target of maximum heart rate. If you have your threshold heart rate set accurately. You can just set your target to 80% and that should be a reasonable Zone 2 target as well.\n\n**The best way to determine your target Zone 2 heart rate**\n\n![Zone 2 Heart Rate test using ERG mode on a smart trainer](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1lwv9_NqmII0sExACjPhegA.png)\n\nHere is a link to that workout.

The primary goal is to inspire you to take full control of your training and be more confident in your choices and recognize when you are going off the path. Following a generic training plan will rarely make you as fast as if you self-coach and make quality adjustments along the way. These adjustments are critical to top health, which plays a big part in your performance.\n\nVideo Review: CTS is arguably one of the most respected coaching organizations in the world. In this video, Dylan represents the CTS and backs up his claims with evidence. He uses references from the extremely well-respected sports scientist Stephen Seiler from Norway. I am not so sure it is everything you need to know in 15-minutes, especially I think he could limit the discussion on weight training. His other videos fill in many of the gaps he left out of this.\n\nOne interesting thing is, just like virtually all pro-level coaches, Dylan\u2019s suggestions are simple. Basic periodization, a few simple workouts that progressively get harder and a shift to more weight training in the off season. What we call a peak period, he calls a build period, that targets your specific goals.\n\n[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nqHn3vAWpI)\n\n**Some of Dylan\u2019s claims below**\n\nMany of them backed up with evidence\n\nBelow, we have captured some good points Dylan makes in this video. Take these and start to build your own library of knowledge on how to self-coach and take your performance to the next level. It takes a little time, but your performance will benefit. Invest in your future!!!\n\n1.  Periodization means that your training is changing over time, which is what we want\n2.  When planning out a season it\u2019s important that your workouts become more specific to your goal event as you get closer to that event\n3.  Short-term periods of high-intensity interval training can elicit improvements but also that important adaptations appear to occur with low intensity continuous training that are not observed with mixed or high-intensity training when training does not have an appropriate blend of both high-intensity training and high-volume training inserted into the program performance ability can stagnate\n4.  The timeline for all of this higher intensity could be four to seven months before you want to be in peak shape\n5.  With few exceptions having just two or on occasion three high-intensity days per week is what you\u2019re shooting for and you want to do these days when you\u2019re well-rested so they can be as high quality as possible\n6.  Don\u2019t forget to throw in a rest week every three to four weeks to rid your\n7.  Body of the fatigue you\u2019ve built up during a rest week you\u2019re still riding but at about forty to sixty percent of your normal volume\n8.  The optimal tapering strategy was one that reduced volume without any modifications in intensity or frequency\n9.  One of the most important things you can do to improve your cycling performance is to not train at selective points in the year hear me out taking a break is extremely important to progress and often times athletes will find that they get their best results after a period of forced rest the offseason and mid-season break are commonplace amongst pro cyclist for one simple reason it works\n10.  The research really couldn\u2019t be more clear lifting will make you a faster cyclist\n11.  You want to start lifting in the offseason when your training load is low and reduce or stop doing it as training volume gets high\n\nI will continue to add more of Dylan\u2019s suggestions here, but my key point is to **start with highly reputable coaches and coaching organizations that use evidence to support their suggestions.** This will reduce confusion and I believe you will find you see a lot more consensus across the different programs. Dylan has a lot of videos. Take notes on them (we will continue to do this). If you take his suggestions and build a cheat-sheet, you will start having solid principals to being your own coach.\n\n**Europe vs America**\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0xgaoVk6vxqund0VU.jpg)\n\nI am friends with one of the top European coaches.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4194, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72516229-e420-47d0-a1a0-cd37b5c9dc50": {"__data__": {"id_": "72516229-e420-47d0-a1a0-cd37b5c9dc50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-everything-you-need-to-know-about-training-in-15-minutes-dylan-johnson-cts-d6bd3dff859b", "title": "Everything You Need to Know About Training in 15 Minutes: Dylan Johnson (CTS)", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-everything-you-need-to-know-about-training-in-15-minutes-dylan-johnson-cts-d6bd3dff859b.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8c5671c1-e0e6-46af-a805-af3096ff4b07", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-everything-you-need-to-know-about-training-in-15-minutes-dylan-johnson-cts-d6bd3dff859b", "title": "Everything You Need to Know About Training in 15 Minutes: Dylan Johnson (CTS)", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-everything-you-need-to-know-about-training-in-15-minutes-dylan-johnson-cts-d6bd3dff859b.md"}, "hash": "917e7cd776788e048c4318bd94a6df2217114bdef44f423d59cb285207ead9f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b796bf3-c057-4602-bdba-b54189c95d9e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-everything-you-need-to-know-about-training-in-15-minutes-dylan-johnson-cts-d6bd3dff859b", "title": "Everything You Need to Know About Training in 15 Minutes: Dylan Johnson (CTS)", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-everything-you-need-to-know-about-training-in-15-minutes-dylan-johnson-cts-d6bd3dff859b.md"}, "hash": "cc1086317d3733144fc5f81d66e42f26ad7497eb46760b4b226fee3cc05915a2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The research really couldn\u2019t be more clear lifting will make you a faster cyclist\n11.

What I see is his big picture principals are similar to Dylan\u2019s. Looking at the respected cycling author Joe Friel, Joe also seems to follow similar big picture fundamentals. I would say Joe provides a lot of detail that makes it feel a complex. I trust Joe, buy our goal is to simplify. We feel in most cases complex plans and workouts come from marketing based programs and both complexity and the \u201clatest and greatest\u201d helps sell books and plans.\n\nAmerica has this no-pain, no-gain philosophy related to training. Europe is a little more pragmatic in general. Europe also seems to moving closer it\u2019s thinking towards buying into this American and now global marketing. If you look more closely at the top coaches in both the US and Europe, they continue to promote both the value of easy and recovery. Easy does not product pain, but it does produce results when used correctly.\n\n**My belief is** when you see the effectiveness of simple plans and workouts following evidence-based programs, you will decide you don\u2019t need these marketing based complexities. Our goal is to provide you this information in the minimum number of words possible. We will do this by providing targeted information based on your goals and life. This article is step one towards our learning solution. It helps establish a baseline. Our/your primary learning tools will come in 2020/2021. I hope we are helping make your choices easier, not harder.\n\nThis article has been reviewed by my anonymous pro-coach friend and 30-year veteran cycling coach Benoit and given a stamp of approval.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0K_z9MCSaxiQbE2GE.jpg)\n\n**So what do I do?** Start with the big picture. If you get the big picture right, your self-coaching will take you a long way down the right path.\n\n**What is the big picture?** I would focus on having a solid annual training plan (ATP) or in other words, a well-executed periodization model. Don\u2019t do the same thing all year long!!! For example, you need recovery time built into your year. Nail periodization and the rest will probably fall into place.\n\n**MORE COMMING SOON.** This is just the tip of the iceberg, but I feel it is an important part that many cyclists are not spending enough time on.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3313, "end_char_idx": 6449, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d92f7e7d-22be-4c0f-ac60-d1faf863955b": {"__data__": {"id_": "d92f7e7d-22be-4c0f-ac60-d1faf863955b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-find-and-use-our-cycling-training-plans-872aae29fac9", "title": "Find And Use Our Cycling Training Plans", "category": "Features", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["sharing"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-find-and-use-our-cycling-training-plans-872aae29fac9.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bfc95c71-20bb-45db-b3ed-9dcdcb381f23", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-find-and-use-our-cycling-training-plans-872aae29fac9", "title": "Find And Use Our Cycling Training Plans", "category": "Features", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["sharing"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-find-and-use-our-cycling-training-plans-872aae29fac9.md"}, "hash": "f1ec901aa7d155aff93f2eddb51113843a523d5a36f0ffd7884fbc15e97a83b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We are 100% focused on building the best or only platform for sharing training plans.

It does not need to be difficult. It just means don\u2019t do the same intensity all year long. There are two parts to this. The first one is very few people, including pros, can go hard or consistently increasing time or intensity for too many months in a row without seeing the negative effects. Second is, if you are highly consistent, you need some longer \u201cdown time\u201d periods during the season.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1niD8aty4OCDghSDpMBPNhA.jpg)\n\nOne problem is this sounds like what many people consider \u201cthe dreaded base period.\u201d I hear things like \u201cNo one does base period anymore.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have time for super long aerobic workouts and don\u2019t want to do them indoors.\u201d In talking with pro-coach Andrea Morelli, for most of us \u201cregular riders\u201d or non-pros, a base period is less about building a large aerobic base and more about recovering from a lot of built up cycling fatigue. Just another form of recovery.\n\nIn the North, you have your main cycling season outdoors where you ride as much as possible from March to September, then you need a period of preparation to do it again. If you do this preparation correctly, you set yourself up for gains in the next build period, if you do it incorrectly\u2026 well, let\u2019s just stay. You\u2019re likely to stay at the same FTP \u201cforever.\u201d\n\nOne of the worst experiences is to do some super hard training from October to February, only to be burned out by the time June rolls around. You want to feel amazing from April-June. This should be an incredible period of cycling followed by a great summer. Most riders can only build up for about ~4 months in a row before hitting their seasonal or bi-seasonal peak both mentally and physically. Don\u2019t start this 4\u20136 months too early. Does that mean you can\u2019t do any hard training in the winter? No, and no, a traditional base period is not a requirement. So what am I suggestion?\n\n**Recovery 101**\n\nConsistency is the most critical component of success. The downside is, if you are consistent, you need to build in recovery periods at many levels.\n\nYou need a daily recovery period (good sleep). Most of us need a weekly recovery period (days off), if we are building up or doing a lot of intensity we need a monthly recovery pattern (3/1 or 2/1, meaning 3 hard weeks 1 easy) and we need seasonal or some type of \u201cmacro recovery.\u201d Each of these recoveries are a little rest to let your body move ahead. There are many ways to do this and people are unique. We all need some forms or recovery. Even genetically exceptional pros have many levels of recovery.\n\nSo you need rest, recovery, and consistency. You need to find patterns that work best for you. If you are going medium hard all year round, you are going to stop improving, might burn out, or even become over-trained. If your FTP has not been hitting new peaks in recent years, something is likely wrong.\n\nStarting your build season on the easier end of the spectrum means you can train more often with less risk/recovery. As you get later in your season, things get harder. This sets you up for a great spring where you are highly motivated to perform. This might mean starting out with 95% of your rides easy (less than your aerobic threshold) and 5% of your TIME around your lactate threshold (FTP) or harder and then slowly increasing the duration of harder efforts as your season progresses.\n\nIf you are highly consistent, then following a traditional annual training plan, in early winter you should focus on recovery and holding on to most of your fitness but losing a little is totally fine, you will gain it back and some. Your intensity session could be a once a week short HIIT session just so you don\u2019t feel you are losing it all, and to make you feel better, but you should try to do some cross training and/or become more balanced. While cycling is very enjoyable, it is not a very balanced sport. Rowing machines and strength training can help in the offseason.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4045, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eee9e902-6af6-490d-8eea-201ce8f2f08e": {"__data__": {"id_": "eee9e902-6af6-490d-8eea-201ce8f2f08e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-periodization-101-for-dummies-50d7b34a881b", "title": "Periodization 101 for \"Dummies\"", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-periodization-101-for-dummies-50d7b34a881b.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cde8a5e2-78d5-49cc-a712-ba214dfc6f31", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-periodization-101-for-dummies-50d7b34a881b", "title": "Periodization 101 for \"Dummies\"", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-periodization-101-for-dummies-50d7b34a881b.md"}, "hash": "d9f4af62e9803ab05f4bcf760b32bdb991a983c07d3172fc79bc400817d046a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "38c350a5-6614-4e5a-b730-4a5ff0f24465", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-periodization-101-for-dummies-50d7b34a881b", "title": "Periodization 101 for \"Dummies\"", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-periodization-101-for-dummies-50d7b34a881b.md"}, "hash": "1817fc2fcb8fe9fea8e01292beabec61d87d95f04b9e67e768a3e9204df2b9fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This sets you up for a great spring where you are highly motivated to perform.

While cycling is very enjoyable, it is not a very balanced sport. Rowing machines and strength training can help in the offseason.\n\nIf you really want to go hard in the late fall and very early winter, you need to be smart. You can experiment with mini build / recovery periods, but it is very easy to overdo it. It\u2019s better to error on the side of a little too little than a little too much. Taking time off because of injury, illness or burnout during peak season does not lead to your best cycling seasons. If you are feeling slightly undertrained, you can make that up with some end of the season hard efforts and make last-minute gains.\n\nFind what works for you. Think of periodization as Base (recovery + minimizing loss), Build (regain and improve), and Peak (hardest focused period to maximize your goal performance). A peak period of 4\u20138 weeks can cause great anaerobic improvements but it can\u2019t last much longer than that and you won\u2019t continue to improve.\n\nI hope this helps. Find what works for you. You might have 1,2,3 or possibly even 4 of these periodizations throughout the year, although 1 or 2 is most common.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1zpdAscQ42KDoiAfwaK4sWw.png)\n\nDuring these easy periods, if you are consistent your FTP will drop a little and your anaerobic power will drop even more but this is something you can gain back quickly and then go beyond previous levels. Don\u2019t try to keep building FTP all year round. Your plan can be totally different then the above, just follow the concept of varied intensity levels and getting plenty of recovery at multiple levels and you will be good to go for those seasonal FTP gains.\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nWhether it is recovery weeks or recovery months, you need recovery. At the end of recovery periods you should feel hungry for \u201creal training.\u201d Self-control is the difference between a fitness athlete that does not improve and a performance athlete that reaches the moon. **Learn to feel hungry!!! Again, Learn to feel hungry!!!** Learn to ease into a build period. Learn to become the best, smartest athlete you can be.\n\nClick to learn more.

Let me try to make it simple.\n\n**Apps**  \nYou can use apps like Zwift, TrainerRoad or TrainerDay among many more. Zwift is a video game where you ride with other people. TrainerRoad and TrainerDay are more focused on specific training.\n\n**Trainer types  \n**The most common indoor training devices are smart trainers, dumb trainers, exercise (spin) bikes and finally smart bikes. Any of these can be used with TrainerDay but the best experience is with a smart bike or smart trainer. If you use a dumb trainer or spin bike it\u2019s best if they have a power meter but virtual power converts speed and distance to power may also work. Tacx, Elite, Saris, Zwift Hub and Wahoo seem to be the most popular smart trainers these days. The JetBlack Volt, just like the Zwift device, is popular within our users because it is a great value.\n\n**Device Control Modes (Smart bikes and Smart trainers only)  \n**Control modes are ERG mode, slope or sim mode and finally resistance mode. Resistance and slope/sim mode are similar, in slope you specify percentage of grade and resistance is just that. The big difference between ERG mode and the other two is that ERG mode no matter how you pedal our app will control the difficulty of your effort. This is called power which is measured in watts. Pedal faster and the device will reduce your resistance meaning overall it\u2019s approximately the same effort. High RPM or very low RPM can feel harder to specific individuals even though the power is the same.\n\nSo we have thousands of workouts on our platform. If you are a premium member, you can search and click add to list and pull down on the library tab in our app and that workout will show up. Once your smart device is connected you can just click on ride now and start pedaling.\n\nUnderstanding the TrainerDay workouts.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1aLkjYKG84HxQaKVagV44oQ.png)\n\nYou don\u2019t need to understand what all these things mean on this screen. The main thing is the tall blue bars represent higher intensity (more watts) and lower blue parts are easier. This is frequently discussed in % of FTP. 40% is easy, 80% is moderately hard and 100%+ starts getting difficult depending on how long you do it.\n\nI suggest most people that are newer to cycling to start with a base period. That could be as simple as using HR mode in our training app and doing zone 2 or finding some lower intensity workouts. Now that said, you surely can add a little intensity to make it fun. If you are doing 3 or less days a week a day with some slowly increasing intensity might be a good idea.

You can only do smart slopes in our training app. Smart slope workouts are especially perfect for short-intervals. On many smart-trainers ERG mode is not good for short- intervals. I think all trainers are bad for 5-second intervals in ERG mode. Science has shown that very short intervals can be a great minimalistic method of training.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0hGttUAsyWEYot4iW.png)\n\nSprinting in slope mode by shifting gears and increasing cadence makes it more like an outdoor sprint. Smart Slopes or automated slope mode allows the trainer to change slopes automatically, similar to Zwift except that you are programming the slopes. Slope workouts are very individual.\n\n**Slope mode workouts require practice.** Practice in creating the perfect workout and practice executing the workout. We will start creating a list of recommended slope workouts, but you will still need to perfect your gears and cadence to hit the targets. When you are creating workouts, you are setting the slope, but you are also setting the target power/percent. This target power is a visual representation of what you are trying to hit, but since you control the power output by changing gears and cadence, it\u2019s only a reference point.\n\n**Mixed slope and ERG mode.** If you have ever taken a 20-minute FTP test or 8-minute FTP test on most platforms, they go in and out of ERG and slope or resistance mode. You can design your own workouts to do exactly the same in TrainerDay. Any interval you can change to slope or erg just by clicking the switch in our app.\n\nSee our editor before on how to create slope workouts. You don\u2019t need to set slope in the interval type unless you want it to automatically change for you.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0pEOaLR0G1vagKEA9.png)\n\nTo use smart slopes you must have a premium account.\n\nIf you have a premium account now, you can start creating your first workout in our [workout creator.](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/create)\n\n[Upgrade Now](https://trainerday.com/pricing/)\n\n### A great example slope\u00a0workout\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0cymNak6fNn-586IU.png)\n\nHere is a [link to that workout](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/4-second-intervals)\n\n[https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/4-second-intervals](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/4-second-intervals)\n\nThis workout first increases slope right before the 4-second intervals. Then you should shift and increase cadence and go as hard as you can for 4-seconds.\n\nHere is a study showing this can be great for general fitness, but 4-second workouts can be fun when you need something else to do as well as bringing great sprinting benefits. **You must have a trainer that is capable of more watts than your 4-second limit.**\n\n[https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/fitness/four-second-interval-workouts-may-be-all-it-takes-to-maintain-fitness-and-strength-1.4654140](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/fitness/four-second-interval-workouts-may-be-all-it-takes-to-maintain-fitness-and-strength-1.4654140)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3238, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c75b4a46-a929-4276-bcac-3cbec636d554": {"__data__": {"id_": "c75b4a46-a929-4276-bcac-3cbec636d554", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-trainerday-and-trainingpeaks-48451053a7ef", "title": "Trainerday And Trainingpeaks", "category": "Features", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["training-peaks", "WOD"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-trainerday-and-trainingpeaks-48451053a7ef.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "63b9be43-c5ed-48a3-b99b-c3aea74869ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-trainerday-and-trainingpeaks-48451053a7ef", "title": "Trainerday And Trainingpeaks", "category": "Features", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["training-peaks", "WOD"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-trainerday-and-trainingpeaks-48451053a7ef.md"}, "hash": "25dc792e1c96fc2595b77257e1b6fb6973cd8599dbd98ab090e955a2cb285edc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "### Using TrainerDay workouts in other apps and\u00a0devices\n\nOne of the easiest ways to use TrainerDay workouts is to create a free TrainingPeaks account and connecting that to Rouvy, TrainerRoad, Zwift, Wahoo or a lot of other apps.

Just find any workout or plan and send it to TrainingPeaks. With plans you should have a Premium TrainingPeaks account or the whole plan will go on a single day. But one easy thing to do is each day you want to train. Find your workout and click send to TrainingPeaks and in 30 seconds or less you can see it in they training platform of your choice.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0_Ea78aE9khMEDcp7.png)\n\nOther options for using TrainingPeaks are what is called WOD.

Unlike outdoor cycling, which is subject to weather, traffic, and terrain variables, indoor cycling provides a controlled environment where every aspect of your workout can be precisely measured and optimized.\n\n## The Benefits of Controlled Training\n\nIndoor cycling offers several distinct advantages over outdoor training:\n\n**Consistent Power Output**: With a quality trainer, you can maintain exact wattage targets without the influence of wind, hills, or traffic stops. This consistency is crucial for structured interval training and threshold work.\n\n**Data Precision**: Modern smart trainers provide incredibly accurate power, cadence, and heart rate data. This precision allows for micro-adjustments in training that can lead to significant performance gains over time.\n\n**Time Efficiency**: No warm-up rides to training locations, no coasting downhills, and no traffic lights mean every minute on the bike is productive training time.\n\n## Training Zones and Structured Workouts\n\nThe ability to maintain precise power zones makes indoor cycling ideal for:\n\n- **Sweet Spot Training**: Sustained efforts at 88-94% of FTP\n- **Threshold Intervals**: Work at or slightly above your lactate threshold\n- **VO2 Max Intervals**: Short, high-intensity efforts to improve aerobic capacity\n- **Recovery Rides**: Easy-paced sessions for active recovery\n\n## Technology Integration\n\nModern indoor cycling setups can integrate with various platforms and apps, providing:\n\n- Virtual racing environments\n- Structured training plans\n- Real-time coaching feedback\n- Performance analytics and tracking\n\n## Creating an Effective Indoor Training Environment\n\nTo maximize your indoor cycling experience:\n\n1. **Ventilation**: Proper airflow prevents overheating and maintains performance\n2. **Entertainment**: Music, videos, or virtual platforms keep sessions engaging\n3. **Hydration**: Easy access to fluids is crucial for longer sessions\n4. **Data Display**: Clear visibility of power, heart rate, and other metrics\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIndoor cycling training, when properly executed, can be more effective than outdoor training for specific performance goals. The key is leveraging the controlled environment to focus on precise efforts that drive adaptation and improvement.\n\nWhether you're a competitive cyclist looking to fine-tune your power zones or a fitness enthusiast seeking efficient workouts, indoor cycling provides the tools and environment to achieve your goals systematically and measurably.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2684, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71fef913-de64-4f2a-a409-a18d437edaa2": {"__data__": {"id_": "71fef913-de64-4f2a-a409-a18d437edaa2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-tagging-this-tagging-that-organize-your-workout-library-69bc339f41dc", "title": "Tagging This, Tagging That: Organize Your Workout Library", "category": "Features", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["workout-creator", "organization", "my-workouts"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-tagging-this-tagging-that-organize-your-workout-library-69bc339f41dc.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c5d932e9-4f39-45fd-b617-3894ea03843e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-tagging-this-tagging-that-organize-your-workout-library-69bc339f41dc", "title": "Tagging This, Tagging That: Organize Your Workout Library", "category": "Features", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": ["workout-creator", "organization", "my-workouts"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-tagging-this-tagging-that-organize-your-workout-library-69bc339f41dc.md"}, "hash": "2773f8d06b3bfecb26df6a4a8c413c118fbbb8d899310b9d67f4ee349ee292ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We have multiple ways to organizing your workouts.

But if you want to excel in MTB, cyclo-cross, or find yourself periodically get dropped in sprints with your buddies, you might need to build your anaerobic power.\n\nFTP, i.e. Functional Threshold Power, has become the most common term in performance cycling. It is great to have a single term to represent your cycling fitness level. It\u2019s very useful that it allows **AEROBIC** training to be easily and even automatically adjusted to the right intensity.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0XOzrJ9RinsaYnqv8.png)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0RRh402_XqybSuGBV.png)\n\n### The other energy system\u200a\u2014\u200aAnaerobic\n\nA deeper understanding of your fitness requires looking at both your aerobic and anaerobic abilities. If you take a ramp test, for example, your anaerobic power might noticeably affect your test, throwing off your FTP a little.\n\nDiscussing and thinking about anaerobic capacity seems to be scary for many cyclists, not the anaerobic training itself, but measuring anaerobic seems to be the scary part.\n\nMeasuring your anaerobic can be as simple as measuring your FTP and provide valuable insight and give you motivation when your FTP has flatlined.\n\n### Burning Matches\n\nCyclists like to call it burning matches, you only have so many to burn before your energy level crashes. The number of matches you have is your Anaerobic Work Capacity (AWC or W\u2019) We will use the term W\u2019 (pronounced W-Prime).\n\nMonitoring your personal W\u2019 will give you insight to your Anaerobic Work Capacity. Weight lifting is anaerobic and both it and anaerobic cycling follow similar principals. Imagine going to the gym, lifting weights but not tracking or even measuring your progress. Just grab a random set of weights and lift them a random number of times. Similar to lifting weights, building your W\u2019 requires training close to or to failure. Doing the correct amount of exercise will provide more predictable results, allowing your body to repair and build itself. We could all use a few more matches.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0TOqNMHh15K4t9Q0D.png)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0bN-mxf7XLySPsZrM.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0bSajC43XgSgjMdbg.jpg)\n\n### Light bulbs and your Electricity bill\n\nWe have been comfortable using watts for lightbulbs and hair-dryers for a long time, and with the popularity of power meters we are comfortable using watts on our bikes. The watts measurement is instantaneous, it has no time. You can say \u201cwatts for 10-seconds\u201d but watts themselves have no time. So when talking about energy, we need to include time. This unit of measurement is kilojoules (kJ). A joule is 1-watt for 1-second. Kilojoules are on your electricity bill. You measure your W\u2019 in kilojoules. You likely have a W\u2019 between 5\u201340kJ. That is a fixed number of watts for a fixed amount of time.\n\n### W\u2019s amazing\u00a0cousin\n\nSo one of the incredible benefits of knowing your W\u2019 along with your FTP is with our new feature in our workout creator, you can find or design intervals that precisely fit your fitness profile.\n\nFor example, you are doing 2-minute VO2Max intervals.

But no need to fear, we\u2019re explaining all of these terms and more in your Indoor Cycling for Beginners series, and today we are going to tackle the world of wireless technology in Bluetooth and ANT+.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1bkTlJ12OP_3P5ArLXTVOHw.png)\n\nWithout diving too deep into technological mumbo-jumbo, Bluetooth and ANT+ are two different wireless protocols used to connect electronic devices, and are the main two networks used for connecting fitness equipment such as heart rate monitors, head units, power meters, smart trainers, and smart watches.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1peGygwAu6dHbdvi2jMXc6w.png)\n\nANT+, specifically, is a new generation of ANT wireless technology which is designed to be lower power (helping the battery last longer) and used for portable fitness devices.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1TiWbN2U-ajKksC969mHuvw.jpg)\n\nBluetooth, on the other hand, is a higher-power wireless connectivity protocol used for more than just cycling devices. Bluetooth (BT) can be used for streaming audio and visuals because it operates at a much higher bit-rate and consumes significantly more battery than ANT+. However, BT can only connect devices one-to-one, which means that you can\u2019t connect your power meter to both your head unit and your smart watch using BT simultaneously. In contrast, ANT+ allows for multiple simultaneous connections, which means that you could record power data on both your head unit and your smart watch simultaneously using ANT+.\n\nThis all goes to say that both BT (specifically, Bluetooth FE-C, or Fitness Equipment-Control) and ANT+ can be used for indoor cycling, with both protocols being supported on all current indoor cycling equipment. Bluetooth FE-C or ANT+ is what allows you to connect your smart trainer to your tablet, or your heart rate monitor with Zwift, or your power meter with your head unit.\n\nThe biggest differences between Bluetooth FE-C and ANT+. Bluetooth FE-C is the relatively stronger and more stable connection as long as the two devices are in close proximity. ANT+ can connect multiple devices which are also further from each other, although the connection is not quite as stable, and if ANT+ is not native to your device, you will need an ANT+ dongle to enable the connection.\n\nFor beginners, start with enabling Bluetooth on the two device you wish to pair. Bluetooth is the most common wireless protocol, and the most stable for an indoor cycling setup.\n\nWritten by Zach Nehr", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2836, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ea6ed2f-6c2b-49c0-b251-9e05e4dc1657": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ea6ed2f-6c2b-49c0-b251-9e05e4dc1657", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-w-is-not-with-good-over-under-examples-378d6d7680df", "title": "W' Is Not Everything: Good Over-Under Examples", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Geek-Out", "tags": ["w-prime"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-w-is-not-with-good-over-under-examples-378d6d7680df.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e76060f6-31e3-4905-8b45-6a52cbd1c547", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-w-is-not-with-good-over-under-examples-378d6d7680df", "title": "W' Is Not Everything: Good Over-Under Examples", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Geek-Out", "tags": ["w-prime"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-w-is-not-with-good-over-under-examples-378d6d7680df.md"}, "hash": "e261081ca4be6c91aab26941d23313dc54af1059bdc1ced946514760ab5da801", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "### W\u2019 does not tell you how hard a workout\u00a0is.\n\nA 20-minute workout close to FTP is very hard, or very, very hard.

If it does not have power it will give simple power estimates but this is not made for optimizing route performance. It also shows the same slopes.\n\n#### Importing routes have three key features.\n\n**Number One:** If you ride a route outdoors, you can download it as TCX or GPX and assuming you have a power meter and power data when you import it you can ride it as ERG mode in many apps. We will add FIT file import soon.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1dVRLJrpMNc2IMhnCL-BYJg.png)\n\n**Number Two:** If you find or create a route using google maps, RidewightGPS, strava routes or your friends maps, you can download the GPX or TCX and import WITHOUT power data and we will create power estimates for ERG mode. Now I would not say this is overly accurate as people ride hills all kinds of different ways, but as you go from 0% to 20% slope grade, you will find the power target getting harder and harder.\n\n**Number Three\u200a\u2014\u200aThe coolest feature.** Is slope mode in our app (coming soon). If you want to ride the same slopes, similar to training effect as right hills in Zwift, but without the cartoons we will automatically convert elevation changes into slopes. When we add this automatic slope mode in our app, you can go in and out of slope vs ERG automatically. We and many others feel that for sprinting on an indoor trainer slope mode is superior. ERG does not allow for dynamic sprinting. We will add a video and more information about this soon on this page. We expect this to launch in September 2021.\n\nThis feature is not good for TT race pace planning. I mean if you did a route previously and like the powerout put you did, sure you could repeat this and get good at it, but taking a route and using our power estimates will not produce anything useful for TT race pace. You should use Best Bike Split tool for that but it is complicated and you should have a pretty good idea of your aerodynamic drag to use it (cDA).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2084, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d59a492-8744-4843-9ff2-a04100c0f828": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d59a492-8744-4843-9ff2-a04100c0f828", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-indoor-cycling-101-beginners-setup-a3b1e17c7d6c", "title": "Indoor Cycling 101 Beginners Setup", "category": "Indoor", "engagement": "Quick", "tags": ["equipment", "technology"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-indoor-cycling-101-beginners-setup-a3b1e17c7d6c.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "73005d56-0455-4bc4-a21d-3f666b2382f0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2023-01-01-indoor-cycling-101-beginners-setup-a3b1e17c7d6c", "title": "Indoor Cycling 101 Beginners Setup", "category": "Indoor", "engagement": "Quick", "tags": ["equipment", "technology"], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2023-01-01-indoor-cycling-101-beginners-setup-a3b1e17c7d6c.md"}, "hash": "9a9f2cb7cb66aeb3ca67cef6656ac7c8ff41f561288d18f91ea14fdecabf453d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8dd4480f-8181-4c89-9cfa-3317a0b9a14c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b66df080edc8ceb299efff458843521a24c40b7ceb80b85108be245567444499", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Everything you need to know about setting up your indoor trainer  \nIndoor cycling has never been more popular than in 2022.

But no need to fear\u200a\u2014\u200ain this comprehensive guide and blogs linked below, we\u2019re going to walk you through everything you need to know about indoor cycling, from setting up your smart trainer, to pedaling your first few kilometers on Zwift.\n\n**Building an Indoor Training Space\u200a\u2014**\u200aBefore buying a smart trainer or anything else, you first need to find space to train. For some, this task is quite simple. But for others who may live in a crammed apartment or shared living space, it can seem impossible to find the extra room.\n\nLook for unused nooks and crannies around your living space, and remember that your bike and indoor trainer won\u2019t be very wide. You\u2019ll need about 7 feet by 3.5 feet of floor space for the bike and trainer, and it\u2019s best to setup somewhere permanent\u200a\u2014\u200ai.e. you don\u2019t have to take down your bike and trainer after each ride.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve found the space, it\u2019s time to go shopping for an indoor trainer. Below are a few guides to help you decide which indoor trainer (smart or non-smart trainer, smart bike, spin bike, or rollers) is best for you. There is even an informative blog above Bluetooth and ANT+, which are the wireless protocols that allow you to connect your trainer to an external advice and run an app such as Zwift or TrainerDay. If you\u2019re not sure if your devices are compatible, start there. Otherwise, happy trainer shopping!\n\nIndoor Cycling Trainers\u200a\u2014\u200aSmart vs Non-Smart \\[LINK\\]  \nOther Types of Indoor Cycling Trainers, Rollers, and Bikes \\[LINK\\]  \nHow to Connect Your Trainer to Indoor Cycling Apps: Bluetooth vs ANT+ \\[LINK\\]\n\n**How to Start Riding\u200a\u2014**\u200aIf you are just starting out and are in your first month or two of training, all you need to do is ride.\n\nThere are different kinds of fun for different types of people; you might enjoy riding hard every day. This might work for some, pay close attention to any warning signs so you don\u2019t derail your training by doing too much too soon.\n\nWhat ever you do try to enjoy the ride, keep going! Structure in your training can come later, if you start to feel the fatigue and the need for a more structured training plan.\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting out in indoor cycling, here is my recommendation: ride 3 or 4 days per week, with a simple goal in mind. Aim for 3 hours of riding per week, or 50km of indoor riding, for example.\n\nYou need to learn what your body can handle. Zwift is especially addictive for going hard all the time, if you find yourself riding more than 4 days a week you need to take extra precaution and might want to alternate days on something like TrainerDay free version watching Netflix or an audio book just to help that everyday is not a hard day. Breathing harder than walking is a sign you are not taking it easy.\n\nRiding alone on an indoor trainer can be both boring and training. But in 2022, there isn\u2019t a lack of options for indoor cycling apps, and you\u2019ve come to the right place. Below are a few of the most popular indoor training apps, including the best for racing, training, exploring, and riding with real-life cycling footage.\n\nThere is also a blog about the three different types of indoor cycling.

Remember, there are so many more options that a structured workout app, or a high-intensity virtual racing app. Many of the apps are even free to try.\n\nA Quick Guide to Indoor Cycling Apps\u200a\u2014\u200aZwift, TrainerDay, FulGaz, and More \\[LINK\\]\n\nThree Types of Indoor Cycling\u200a\u2014\u200aVirtual Outdoor, Power Intervals, & Spin Classes \\[LINK\\]\n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble deciding between the apps, try out a few of them. Many provide a free trial period which will give you plenty of time to learn the app, the workouts, and the overall feel, without the added pressure of committing to it long-term. If you\u2019ve never done structured intervals on the indoor trainer, consider this:\n\n**To Work Out, or Not to Work Out\u200a\u2014**\u200aBecause indoor training is stationary, there are fewer factors at play than outdoor cycling. There is no actual wind, speed, or distance; instead, it is all virtual. Indoor cycling apps estimate your speed and distance using power, which is measured in watts.\n\nPower meters can be attached to your bike in either the cranks, bottom bracket, pedals, or rear hub; or they can even be inside your indoor trainer. Power is unequivocally the most important and popular metric for cycling performance, used by Tour de France pros and local Joe\u2019s. You can train to get faster using a power meter and a structured training plan, which is what we do here at TrainerDay.\n\nIndoor training is a unique opportunity to get faster through structured interval training, distraction-free and without the constraints of wind, hills, traffic lights, or weather. You can jump on your indoor trainer any time of day and ride for 20 minutes or three hours\u200a\u2014\u200athe choice is yours.\u00a0  \nStructured interval training is the most effective and efficient way to improve your overall fitness and cycling power output, and there is no better place for it than the indoor trainer. Try one of the workouts from TrainerDay and see how it goes. Remember that this is not a test, and it is okay to fail. It is all part of the learning process, and I\u2019m sure that Mathieu van der Poel has failed more than a few interval sessions throughout his life. You will learn, get better, and come back stronger, ready to crush the next workout and keep progressing towards your cycling goals.\n\nOnce your trainer is ready and your app is ready to go, you\u2019ll want a few accessories to complete your indoor cycling set-up. In the article below, I give you some of my favorite indoor cycling accessories, including a few that I couldn\u2019t live without.\n\nWritten by Zach Nehr", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2985, "end_char_idx": 6318, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "795a3863-a14a-4a2b-b9ac-0a936e6f7015": {"__data__": {"id_": "795a3863-a14a-4a2b-b9ac-0a936e6f7015", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2024-03-05-designing-the-perfect-training-plan-part-1-cea48921cf4c", "title": "Designing The Perfect Training Plan Part 1", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2024-03-05-designing-the-perfect-training-plan-part-1-cea48921cf4c.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7aded901-0017-49e4-b184-6b6262007272", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2024-03-05-designing-the-perfect-training-plan-part-1-cea48921cf4c", "title": "Designing The Perfect Training Plan Part 1", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2024-03-05-designing-the-perfect-training-plan-part-1-cea48921cf4c.md"}, "hash": "c9b669171e826275a5b876e5660205036bc574263d501d3bb7cb1698f724aa83", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e5fa324-b5d5-4ae8-9208-0032767cc70f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cfeb803281806396028fea683c19ccec5fec8924f1eb3527ef7eb8153b720902", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Perfect Training Plan\u200a\u2014\u200aOpen source training plans. We refer to the individual periods of a plan as a block. Each block has a goal. So how do you pick or design the perfect next block? You don\u2019t \ud83d\ude42 It\u2019s always a compromise. Identifying a blocks primary goal will help you create or find the right block. The fundamentals behind base and build blocks fit into most riders seasons or annual training plans. Almost all pro-cyclist have both a base and build periods every season. Most enthusiast/traveller cyclists will benefit from them as well.\n\nI talk with many top cycling coaches including Tour de France coaches. There seems to be a common agreement, there are a lot of terrible plans and workouts floating around these days that make little sense for any cyclist. I am not saying that open source training plans or TrainerDay will solve this problem or improve this soon. Just stating **that\u2019s our goal.**\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-05eKzq0mSWlE8GFae.jpg)\n\n**A Passion for helping others  \n**I believe we need training plans created by people and coaches passionate about helping others stay safe, healthy and improve their cycling abilities. This might not be the most visually appealing plans and workouts or the most profitable but simple, targeted workouts are a great place to start\u00a0. Here is a classic sweet spot workout with a single focus.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-00MjCZDHaHGG_2YTe.png)\n\n**Consistency is the most important step in personal performance.** A plan that keeps you consistent is a good plan. Being under-trained (within reason) is significantly better than becoming physically over-stressed. Error on the side of safety. Too much training stress will reduce your progress and it makes you vulnerable to illness and injury. It\u2019s Stress + **Recovery**. Beginners frequently underestimate the important of recovery.\n\n**So how about exciting training blocks?  \n**The best training blocks may not be the most exciting. The primary goal of most cyclists should be consistency. Variety can help with that goal. Picking the right plan or block frequently requires a coach. Many or most cyclists can\u2019t or are unwilling to pay for coaches\u2019 expertise. Most of us need to educate ourselves the best we can. Good self-coaching can get you far but until you are an expert you should be more conservative. Plans need continued evaluation and adjustments.\n\n**Learn from the experts  \n**CTS is one of the top coaching organizations in the world. Study this video below and listen to Dylan\u2019s complaints about many of the Zwift plans and workouts. Take notes. He gives a lot of clues as to how to design good plans and workouts. **As Dylan points out Zwift is great**, it\u2019s just that some or many plans and workouts are of poor design. This video can take you a long way into designing or choosing a good winter plan. I really believe many of the ideas presented in this video represents the view of many of the top coaches. To repeat **Zwift is great for group rides and racing,** it can also create winter consistency for many cyclists. In addition, there are some quality workouts and plans in Zwift but you need to do a careful evaluation to pick something that makes sense for your goals.\n\nDylan might sound negative about Zwift workouts and plans. I believe he is primarily stating how many of these plans and workouts don\u2019t follow well established best practices. He is also selling his coaching; we understand this. I believe most and possibly all of his points are true regardless of his motive. I will say not every fact is clear for example Dylan states putting the high intensity at the beginning of a workout. I am 100% sure what he means is putting high-intensity shortly after a proper warm-up.\n\n**Warmup, warmup, warmup  \n**A warmup is so important, it will significantly reduce the chances of musculoskeletal damage. Your warmup should build to prepare you for the effort to come.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0NrJ2zksi6xF1B3Wi.png)\n\n**A proper warm-up typically means 20-minutes.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4109, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e5fa324-b5d5-4ae8-9208-0032767cc70f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e5fa324-b5d5-4ae8-9208-0032767cc70f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2024-03-05-designing-the-perfect-training-plan-part-1-cea48921cf4c", "title": "Designing The Perfect Training Plan Part 1", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2024-03-05-designing-the-perfect-training-plan-part-1-cea48921cf4c.md"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7aded901-0017-49e4-b184-6b6262007272", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2024-03-05-designing-the-perfect-training-plan-part-1-cea48921cf4c", "title": "Designing The Perfect Training Plan Part 1", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2024-03-05-designing-the-perfect-training-plan-part-1-cea48921cf4c.md"}, "hash": "c9b669171e826275a5b876e5660205036bc574263d501d3bb7cb1698f724aa83", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "795a3863-a14a-4a2b-b9ac-0a936e6f7015", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "blog", "source_id": "2024-03-05-designing-the-perfect-training-plan-part-1-cea48921cf4c", "title": "Designing The Perfect Training Plan Part 1", "category": "Training", "engagement": "Complete", "tags": [], "content_type": "blog_article", "file_path": "../../vector-processor/source-data/blog_articles/2024-03-05-designing-the-perfect-training-plan-part-1-cea48921cf4c.md"}, "hash": "0eb7452d9dded61b756eb64fc9af226acba90f6f2592dc39bf61d17d9e5c4f83", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Dylan might sound negative about Zwift workouts and plans.
