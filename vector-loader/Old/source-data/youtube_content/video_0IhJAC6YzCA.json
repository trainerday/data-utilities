    "full_text": "hello I'm Alex from trainer day and today I'm going to show you kind of the very simplified version of how to use the trainer day training app and how it integrates with our website and how to do just very basic functions right to get you rolling so you can see here I've got the app open right I'm holding it in my hand also I've got the app open and this is for premium members so this is the feature some of it relates to free users but most of it's directly related to premium functionality so the first thing we see here is the today Tab and if you set up a training plan or if you are using our calendar I'll show you our calendar here if you're using our calendar whatever you have scheduled for today today's the 2 whatever you have scheduled for today will be the first thing that shows up from your calendar right so that's the first thing that you'll see on today whoops I just lost my screen oh my gosh okay and you can slide this over so you can see there's other recommended workouts that or other workouts that are just from our you know massive workout Library our 40,000 public workouts that it tries to pick some good workouts that it thinks are good for you based on your recent activity either from straa or from from our app anyway so that's the today tab you can click on ride now and ride you can refresh this button at the bottom and it will actually give you new let's say recommended workouts right it'll give you your your your calendar workout will never change and your calendar workout is not filtered by the filter at the top but pressing refresh will give you new new workouts that are interesting right so next is our workouts tab at the top top up here I'll use my mouse here the up up here these are lists that you can create to organize your workouts and that's ultimately best done inside of our training app I mean inside of our website so in our website if you come and you go to search workouts and you this is already these are already added you can you can because these are red that means you've already added them to a list but if we want to add a new one we can add it to favorites we can add it to tests whatever whatever list we have and we can add it to a new list so you can create a new list right from here so if I add that to my favorites now it's added now I I'm on my favorites here and when I hit refresh this little button right up here this little refresh then you will see that new workout is there now you can see that this new workout that I just added is in my favorites so you can do that from the app as well it's just that the search functionality in the website currently is a lot better than the search functionality in the app so you also can do that from here so you can come and click on this little search button oops I'm clicking with the wrong thing I click on the little search button now I can type whatever I want or I can just hit search space button to search if you just want to browse everything just hit the space button and hit search so then it comes back with a whole list again and if you click on that you can then also uh okay so you can click on that workout and down at the bottom you can see you can also add it to a list here so you can manage your lists and search workouts from inside here and add more to list and that just makes them really easy to access and quick to access across the top or you can just search and ride one so once you have a workout that you like okay so when we you know when you're first starting out for example if you don't know your FTP your functional threshold power which means the amount of power that you can sustain for about 40 minutes like the maximum amount it's good to do a ramp test so this first one is the ramp test and uh and you can just click ride now and do your ramp test right and so when I click ride now you know one of the things you see here is you you have to go to devices and you have to connect your devices so I have a test device here I can use and I will add that and then you will see this test device automatically generates power and heart rate and RPM and stuff and so you will see those those values show up and you'll see it start to progress right so then you in this F in this ramp test you get some messages and you can read them or follow them anyway so then you're doing the workout and then in a in a ramp test when you get to your to the end right when you can't pedal anymore it will just kind of to and it will tell you your estimated FTP so so that's a ramp test in general we have these different modes you can see HR plus ERG and slope and ERG is where your power is automatically controlled so no matter what gear you're in on your bike um or what Cadence you're pedaling the power is going to stay consistent you know if you have too small a gear or too big a gear sometimes there's some problems but if you're like in a middle gear or any of the middle gears generally that's just going to control your the intensity of your pedaling slope mode is basically like a manual mode so if I click on slope or now I'm in a manual mode and I can press plus minus that will increase the slope so that's like the slope on a hill it will increase it and increase your intensity but you also can increase your intensity by you know increasing your Cadence and pedaling faster or changing your gears or you know to increase or decrease you also can click on each of these little you know you can click on each of the little things and you can see that this changes the direction from going up to going down right and the same as with some of these other ones you can change this one to average Watts right and you can change this to percent of FTP so you can change all these values and experiment with them so that's the basics so let me then we get into you know working with calendars and you know I've got my calendar here I can either add a training plan to my if I want to follow a training plan I can add a training plan our community tra plans are you know it's kind of hard to pick or find what you want if you're a little bit more experienced maybe you know what you want and you can find a good community plan but if you don't know what you're looking for your best off starting with Coach Jack right and Coach Jack will build you a plan It'll ask you some questions you know it will build you a plan and ultimately there there's some skip steps that got skipped here but you should understand them and ultimately you get to hear and it's going to recommend a plan and you can change that you can change it from 8 weeks to 12 weeks to you know whatever you would like it to be um and you can change the intensity if if you it starts out too easy for you you can increase the starting intensity and we also have kind of this ride feel that you can make it harder I recommend starting at level one for most people even if you're an advanced athlete if you're in the middle of a training period or block and you're at a peak intensity and you want to go higher then moving this up definitely makes sense but if you're kind of starting out or something then or starting out your season or this block or whatever then I I recommend starting at level one some people just like higher intensity and and they just don't want to do low intensity so go ahead and increase it anyway um I'm not going to go into all of Co coach Jack but let's just say create a 4-week plan and then ultimately save next and send it to your calendar and then it will be on your calendar I'm not going to explain my my plans that's kind of a little bit more of an advanced feature but does add some great functionality that the that it creates a reusable plan that you can then send to your calendar or follow or it's anyway I'm not going to explain it so so then once you've got a plan on your calendar right you see it here and today you'll have a workout scheduled and you can delete that workout or add an you know click the plus button add a new workout um and so on you also can go to search and you can say send to and send it to my calendar so if you search and you want to you want to send it directly to your calendar it'll send it right to today and then once it's on today you can you can move it around okay so the other things are that you know are fairly important it's may be easier to do it from the website but you can also do some of the stuff from the app directly which is connect to straa so that it automatically posts your rides to straa connect to training Peaks we've got some different features with training Peaks um connect to Garmin so one thing with Garmin you can read here that we can't sync completed activities to Garmin so if you want to sync a completed activity it's best to use run Gap or there's a few different solutions that will that you can you know send stuff to straa and then yeah there's a there's an app that will automatically take it from straven send it to Garmin there's there's a lot of different solutions but they they won't let us or let any new smaller or basically anybody send stuff to uh completed activities there anymore and you've got all your different connections here okay so back to the app I'm going to stop this workout stop I'm going to discard it if you discard a workout and you go to your activities and say you did that on accident or there's actually a delete functionality up here and you can just see the workout I just discarded but I don't see it okay whatever okay so then we've got our settings here you know Sports cycling is going to be for 95% of our users most of the time and cycling FTP will get automatically set from that ramp test if you did one or if you know it you know there's a lot lot of other options here um I'm not really going to go into any of them is there any of them that are important show Power zones no no no show Power zones shows you what zone you're in zone one zone two zone three that might be interesting for some people uh most of the stuff doesn't really that's the simplified version of you know using trainer day thank you very much",
