    "full_text": "are you a cyclist looking to up your training game in this video we'll compare two popular performance cycling apps trainer Road and trainer day despite being the creator of trainer day I'll do my best to provide an unbiased comparison both platforms are exceptional our aim is to highlight the unique features so that you can make an informed decision we'll Begin by discussing the similarities before focusing on the differences both products provide a cycling app that can be used to control Smart trainers both also can be used with non-smart trainers if you don't have a power meter both platforms offer virtual power virtual power uses a speed sensor to estimate your power if you have a smart trainer but prefer to use the power coming from a separate power meter both products offer power match both products also offer a customizable training plan Builder this gives you the ability to create a training plan specific to your goals and your schedule you can manage your workouts on either platform with a simple calendar interface both platforms offer seamless integration with popular cycling computers this allows you to sync your planned workouts to both Garmin and Wahoo let's start by focusing on the advantages of trainer Road trainer Road has been the prominent player in the cycling world since it began began back in 2010 because of its larger size trainer Road has significant advantage in marketing budgets this allows them to create a lot of quality content including podcasts and to host a very active Forum one of the greatest things with trainer road is coach Chad Nate Jonathan and Amber this team provides reliable and valuable advice to many cyclists trainer Road offers a more polished and simpler user experience the trainer Road train now feature offers Dynamic daily workouts tailored to your needs trainer road is currently better at accommodating complex race schedules in their plan Builder trainer Road's plan Builder is better optimized for outdoor use trainer Road offers a wider range of training apps including Windows and Mac trainer Road provides more in-depth metrics and Analysis trainer Road excels in maximizing your TSS and sweet spot workouts I have just mentioned many of the advantages of a trainer road but obviously those may or may not be the most important features for you now let's discuss the advantages of trainer day trainer day is significantly less expensive trainer day has a wider range of options to fine-tuning your plan with his coach jack plan Builder one of trainer day's standout features is its open workout and plan sharing platform this will allow you to down download or use your planned workouts for other training platforms such as zift Ruby intervals ICU training Peaks as well as many more we design trainer day with the self- coach cyclist in mind because of this you can create reusable training plans you can use these in the future but you can also share them with your friends trainer day's workout Builder is faster and more flexible than trainer roads we also allow building slope mode workouts this is like designing your own Hills for The Perfect Workout many coaches suggest that ERG mode is not the best for all of your workouts you should add more variety and get used to judging your own effort levels slope mode is perfect for this training a day has around 4,000 workouts compared to a few thousand in trainer Road usually this does not matter unless you're looking for something specific as an example trainer Road has nine Tabata workouts and trainer day has 155 trainer day's workouts are User submitted so they're not always accurate in their definition but nine is not likely enough once you narrow your search based on duration as well as the number and intensity of intervals trainer day has a unique feature for those that don't want to follow a strict calendar it's called a sequence of workouts you can set any training plan as your current plan and do one workout after the next no calendar required trainer day also has a broadcast feature to view your workouts on a PC or a Mac as you train last but not least the coach jack plan Builder was designed together with one of the top cycling science-based coaches in the world Andrea melli your coach Jack recommended plans will be much different than trainer roads and overall will have a lower intensity especially at the beginning if needed you can override coach Jack's recommendations and make a plan as hard as you want you can also choose from hundreds of community-based plans in summary trainer road is an excellent choice for those who prefer Dynamic daily training changes although I will say trainer day does plan to offer this later in 2023 trainer road is also the industry leader in prescribing High TSS Sweet Spot workouts like spin classes these workouts provide a lot of sweat if that description resonates with you and the price is acceptable trainer Road may be your better choice evidence based science has shown that for many cyclists a high TSS Focus does not produce the best results trainer days affordability flexibility and variety make it a great alternative to trainer Road",
