    "full_text": "hello this is Alex from er gdb I would like to show you our new editor as you can see anybody that's used it before it's got a new look and looks much better than the previous version at least in my opinion early most people's we've also got a new section here called text description and I'll show you how that works the other new main feature is this more options which I will also show you so I'll do a little bit of a summary from the previous version so we have our simple and extremely fast editor here that you can just enter values really quickly that you can you know do 2075 and I'm just using my arrow keys to move around you can then take this and copy and paste it and you can paste below that row if you want to make a new row or you can click on add 10 rows here or clear all rows and so you this will create all of these you know let's call them like steps these are basically steps if you want ramps if you want a long warm-up or a cool-down there's you know you can use this FTP n then this will create a ramp so here you can see this now just went up in a ramp when I put 70 here or a hundred you know right so it goes up in a ramp that's a little bit too fast ten minutes to go to 100% but anyway whatever so so I'll go ahead and delete that and what you can see here is that now we have this feature more options which I'll show you so let me let me clear this out the other thing let me can I undo that no undo doesn't work here so now you can also see our text descriptions it says there's a warm-up for 10 minutes at 50% then your active for 80% there's actually some hidden values here I'll click on cadence and interval that we defaulted to and we stuck warm up in there and active so you can see these in the text descriptions you can leave them blank if you want now it just says 10 minutes at 50% 20 minutes at whatever so you can see that these text descriptions that you could take a screenshot of this you could email it to yourself you could copy and paste it and and text it to yourself or to a friend and now it makes a great outdoor workout right the this is simple easy-to-follow workout workout now there's some features that kind of go along with this text description that make it again kind of easier to create outdoor workouts or easier to follow them which is the concept of sets and reps so I'll click on sets and reps here you can see that so we these are all kind of one set but if we wanted to do you know after a 10-minute workout let's just say say we do five minutes at 65% we'll make it a nice fifteen minute warm-up now we'll do five reps at five minutes each at 90% and then we'll do rest minutes we'll do to rest minutes at 50% so now we've got five times five minutes at ninety percent in two minutes so so now you've got this concepts of reps right and now we can switch back to the previous mode so click it here and it actually kind of expands out into the long version but the text version is still the shortened you know sets and reps view of it so so this is our new editor some people actually prefer editing in this style I I don't you know we haven't launched this yet but I I know other people have talked about preferring editing in this style and seeing it in this style with this it might make it a little bit easier so some of the other new features we have is you can now directly enter things in watts so if you click on this you now see your FTP here you also see you know what your watts are it converted it to watts and so you can enter even watts if you think in watts or if you're if it's easier to do things in watts we also have zones so zones it just takes the middle of the classic coggan power zones and so if you enter zone one it will just take that middle zone one power you can search the internet to see what that is or maybe I'll publish a post to show what those middle zones are but you can enter things just in zones if you prefer and then the text description actually shows everything in zones over here also in that mode yeah so we have we have a lot more features that we want to come with these text descriptions and how they can work with our training plans and stuff and so that's kind of the main the main reason for adding these features and and I hope you enjoyed this very much we're really excited about these features Thanks",
