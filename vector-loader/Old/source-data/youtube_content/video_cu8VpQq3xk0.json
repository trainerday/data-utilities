    "full_text": "hello today I'm going to show you how to use coach Jack plans inside of our mobile training app there's four different ways you can do that you could send it to training Peaks you could send it to interval ICU but the two simple methods I will show you today and that is using our calendar or using my plans I will show you both those options so I will go in here I will select a coach jack plan or create a coach jack plan you can see in my app I've got no plan now I'm on the plan tab there there is no plan there so I'll go ahead and create a plan and I will go ahead and save this and there's two options here these are the two options I'm going to show send to my calendar and send my plans if you want to follow a calendar on specific days of the week and just keep and always have a exact schedule for the future that you know when you want to do it it's best to send it to my calendar by default it goes to the nearest Monday right and you should start the plan next Monday that's the best way to do it and you send it to my calendar okay and now you can see it's available in our calendar so if I go ahead to the app and I refresh I click this little refresh button here you will now see I have that plan in our calendar so so you can see here this is scheduled for January 10th it's sweet spot a January 11th um care funkle 75 which is a Zone 2 ride so that's one method and you can see every C every workout is on a specific day you can move the days around and you can edit a calendar just like any other app so the other option I go back to oops I go back to coach Jack plans I can edit that plan I just created click here and click save again and instead of sying syncing it or sending it to my calendar I can send it to my plans and once I do that and I view my plans now it looks like a calendar but this says week one week two week three this is just a plan it does it is not associated with a date so in this opt you don't have to train on specific days right you can train just day one day two and you know in your mind you're doing it Tuesday Wednesday Saturday but but if things come up you don't have to move the workouts around you just do them one after another so what I do is I come and I go ahead and turn this plan on in the mobile app and now when I come back to the mobile app and I hit refresh I now now have it instead of it showing January 10th it shows day one so now I follow day one day two day three and each time when I finish one I the little box is checked I just save it and it will automatically progress to the next workout and those are the two simplest ways to use coach Jack plans inside of the trainer Day mobile application thank you",
