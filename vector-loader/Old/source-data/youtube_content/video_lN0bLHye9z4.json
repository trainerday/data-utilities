    "full_text": "hello this is alex from trainer day I'm gonna now show you how to use our plans within training piece this is design or this video is around using the premium version of training Peaks which is a better experience on how to do this but the free version can use be used also and I will create a separate video on that so the first thing you need to do is find a plan copy the plan you can find other videos on the site that will show you how to do that and then when you get to the my plans private page it looks like this then I will go ahead and send it to training Peaks so we're going to have a new method very soon called send plan and you'll be able to actually just send it directly from here that's not available yet but it's coming very soon so what I do in the meantime is it's actually fairly manual or there's a lot of kind of steps but it still may be easier than other methods which is I can click on this I can copy that workout and I can come here paste it at a new window and I can say send to training Peaks my trainer day is already connected to trainer training piece so once I send that there you can see this workout then I come to training Peaks I can refresh my calendar they they seem to be so I was just trying it they seem to be very slow right now there it is it showed up so now I just put it on the day that I want it right so again you'd have to go through all your workouts and do that probably takes about five minutes right depending on the length of them the number of workouts that you have to do and normally training piece is a little faster than this and so it's nighttime maybe they're running a process or something anyway so so that's it so then I you know but that requires the premium plan because in order to let's say move your workouts to the future you have to have a premium plan otherwise you can only have them on today the other thing you can do is you can just push a bunch of work out like this whole weeks we're you could just push them all to today if you're using something like Swift or or something else then then it will actually automatically show all of those workouts in Swift and so and so that's it thank you very much",
