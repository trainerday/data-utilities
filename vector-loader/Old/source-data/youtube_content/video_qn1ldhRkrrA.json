    "full_text": "okay this is Alex from trainer R from ER gdb under create workout we now have a new and modified workout editor this all looks the same and it's the same as it was and everything you see the the thing the main thing that's changed is we have this more options but I'll go ahead and enter something a warm-up and we'll say 50 percent and 40 minutes at 80 percent and ten minutes at 50 percent so that's all the same as it was now if I click on more options I now can actually enter workouts directly in watts if I want you have to set your FTP first but once your FTP set you can switch to watts so you now have your Watts entry here you still have ramps meaning if I do this to 150 you'll see that down here the little ramp went up I'll just skip the ramps for now we also have zone entry and what happens when you enter a zone it still ultimately converts it into into FTP percent or percent of FTP for MRC files for ERG files and everything and so in and or if you're gonna or as wish file or if you're gonna send it to Garmin it's still converting it to percent of FTP but you can just enter everything in zones if you want and there's there's kind of an I'll show you another reason that zones are kind of cool then we've also got something called sets and reps and indoor and outdoor cadence so sets and reps I'll click on that so now what you do is you enter the number of kind of repetition that you wants as well as the minutes in the zone so this is perfect for let's let's just switch to FTP percentage and whatever let's just let's just go ahead and click on outdoor and cadance will just put that on there also so now what we do is we see what we're calling outdoor workout format and so this is something that makes it easier to ride in and so we can type a W you here you can click information and see what the the keywords are and now it's just said that there's a ten minute warm-up and now let's just say there's forty at eighty instead of forty and eighty let's just say that there's five reps and there is let's just say five each at 80 and then there's a rest for one minute rest at 50% and we'll call this a climb so there you've got to climb and then we've got a cool down and we could call this a CD and this is a cool-down let me make my screen a little bit wider there there we go anyway this wrong wraps I should I mean I've actually got my zoo screen zoomed way in so at like a hundred and twenty percent so I go down to the standard size as the standard size is more like this and so then you don't see that wrapping and that's how it should be let's just say so then you got a warm-up for ten minutes and you got a climb if it's a climb or or let's just say or you can enter a plus then it's then it's considered your primary work the primary work that you want to do and so it's bolded if you let's just say if we instead of doing this we called this a - this now and turn that into say 70% or just leave it blank and then we'll just do a one a 10 50 and it cooled down so now we've got our primary work we've got 10 minutes of kind of secondary work let's call that 20 minutes or something secondary work and a 10 minute cooldown so the and the secondary work is usually somewhat optional I mean it makes the ride better but it's variable in length we could call it you know free also so we're gonna support things like if you call it a free ride like in Swift and let you ride at whatever power you want it won't be it won't be ERG mode anymore and I believe Garmin supports a free ride also so anyway so you know then we're gonna give you provide a way for you you could basically copy and paste this you know and send it to yourself we're gonna we're going to start giving some options for kind of let's say distribution and create training plans so we're working on training plans and this could all be part of your training plan and and that's our new editor and that's how it works again you can switch I should just say you can switch back from sets and wraps back to the previous editor when you've got outdoor selected use now have this type and you have this and you have cadence also so on this one or this one you you have cadence so you can say I want you know wherever this may this pluses are you could say I want this to be you know let's just say a hi Kate hire Katie let's say just say 100 to 110 cadence for example right or or you could do a real low cadence there but anyway so now you hope you've also got an RPM prescription so this is all new stuff now right now this stuff isn't being distributed anywhere we're not still it's not going to Swift it's not going to into train into sorry into MRC files or anything because most of these Swift would support it I believe but these other formats don't support it yet but we are working on all of that so yeah you so you can switch back and forth from sets and reps to what we are calling the standard viewer though this was the standard old previous view from from ER gdb then we can turn that off and turn it back on again right so we can see the the very simple view anyway and that's it thank you very much",
