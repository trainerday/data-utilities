    "full_text": "hello this is Alex from er gdb I would like to talk to you about a new feature that we just launched it's called my library it replaces my workouts you can see when you go to my my library and you can go to my workouts and my workouts are the ones that you created and they're still here but they're just under here my library is something that you can add and create new lists so I can for example go to the home page or the search or wherever I want and I can say I want to add this workout to my favorites or if I wanted to create a new list I can create a new list so let's say add a new list which is called June 2019 and I can add it there and then when I go back to my library I can see I now have a list called June 2019 and I've got this that workout on it I could also add my workouts today created into my library so it's just a place to organize all of your different workouts so these are just stuff I just randomly picked in was testing but so I could create this one I could add it to favorites I could also add it to June 2019 then I can go to my library and I can now uh when I'm in my library I can actually remove it this workout from a specific list or I can remove it from all this so I have in June 2019 I've got both of those I've got this one as in both and so let's just say I want to remove this only from this list so I can just go there and now it's removed from that list but it's still available at this list anyway that's the my workout so I guess there's a couple other features here which is I do have I've got download as as a drop down instead of the individual items that I've got more by authors similar workouts and clones so on my library it's a little different than the rest of the site and that just makes it so that when you you know if I come over here and I add a few let's jog let's just add to favorites two favorites favorites favorites you can then see now I've got four workouts oh it does them side-by-side so I can see a little bit more and it takes up a little bit less space and that's it thanks",
