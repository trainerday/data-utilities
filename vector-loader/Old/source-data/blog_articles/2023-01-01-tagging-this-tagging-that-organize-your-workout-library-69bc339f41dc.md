title: 'Tagging This, Tagging That: Organize Your Workout Library'
---
We have multiple ways to organizing your workouts. Lists, plans, our calendar and now tagging.

Tagging is a great feature that allows you to organize your workouts in many different ways. We have two kinds of tags, public tags that everyone can see on a public workout, only the creator of the workout can add these, and private tags that you can add that help you keep them organized for your self.

Searching by tags is simple. Just add the # at the beginning and let auto-complete help with the rest
