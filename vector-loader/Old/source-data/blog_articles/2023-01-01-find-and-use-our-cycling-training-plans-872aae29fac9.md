title: Find And Use Our Cycling Training Plans
---
We are 100% focused on building the best or only platform for sharing training plans. TrainerDay has recently just added a calendar. It is our goal to make it easy to integrate with your choice of calendars. Use any calendar. TrainingPeaks, IntervalsICU, Garmin, download ICS file for outlook and others as well as direct Google Calendar integration. We have export to CSV that can be used in many calendars.

We support both open source and private training plans. We have great hopes the community of cyclists and coaches really adopts this platform for sharing like we have for cycling workouts. It should be easy to use, but the video below can help with some details.
