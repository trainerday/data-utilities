Option #1 is Using the TrainerDay “My Calendar”

When saving your plan. Just click Send to My Calendar and by default it will start the following Monday.

Option #2 is using “My Plans” when using my plans, you treat your plan as a sequence of workouts which does not require you to train on specific days but you just do one workout after the next.

The first step is when saving the Coach Jack Plan send it to My Plans

Once you view your plan in my plans you click on these 3 items to set it in the app.
