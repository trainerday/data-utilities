title: 'No Power Meter on Your Bike? No Problem: Heart Rate Training'

Power meters are great especially for short duration higher intensity intervals. But they are not a necessity for training smarter or getting faster. I would argue that many riders would be better off focusing on heart rate. I say this partially because it has been shown that easy rides are a corner stone of performance. Easy and heart rate based training go hand in hand. I would also argue that learning to judge your hard intervals by RPE (rate of perceived exertion) is a valuable step in cycling performance.

As recently popularized, there are 3 primary training zones or intensity targets. Easy, moderate and hard. Arguably, breaking it down farther than this is not a critical component to getting faster. Most people do too much moderate and not enough easy and hard. You can google “Polarized Training” to get a better understanding of this.
