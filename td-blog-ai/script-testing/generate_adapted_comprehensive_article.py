ARTICLE CONTEXT:
Title: The Complete TrainerDay Workout Features Guide
Category: Features/Documentation
Article Type: Comprehensive Feature Documentation
Target Length: Comprehensive (5000+ words - this is the complete guide)

YOUR TASK:
Create a comprehensive guide covering ALL TrainerDay workout features, organized by the categories in the JSON data below. This is the definitive reference for users.

FEATURE DATA TO DOCUMENT:

WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Write in a conversational blog tone - helpful, direct, with subtle personality
- Vary your approach for different features - some technical, some practical
- Be thorough but accessible - explain complex features clearly
- Use real-world examples and scenarios where they help clarify usage
- Keep technical accuracy while maintaining readability
- Group related features logically within each category

TONE GUIDELINES:
- Present features matter-of-factly with enthusiasm for their capabilities

For EACH FEATURE within categories:
- Feature name (as heading)
- What it does (from description)
- Key capabilities (from key_features)
- When/how to use it (from use_cases)
