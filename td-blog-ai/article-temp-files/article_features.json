I could just copy and paste each of these in here like this and then when I change this first 130 to 140 it changes all of them to 140 and you can see my average watch just went to to 260 or if I go 115 I can see my average Watts just went to 225 and then I can just copy and paste this these three rows it ignores kind of that middle row so I just copy and paste these three rows they're all 115s in here I've got my new workout and I can save it and I know my average thanks",

I enjoy designing my on work outs which generally I keep private as they are designed specifically for me.

        "text": "I\u2019m always trying to see how the current implementation I have on my app can be more optimised as well. If you\u2019re interested to know how i did my current implementation, let me know\u2026 I\u2019ve been fine-tuning it over the last 1year and have been using it a lot as I\u2019ve found wonders on using the MAF method on running. Please do share your thoughts / suggestions. I\u2019m really excited to have inputs.\n\nPost 13 by Ratz:\nTechnically, if it was easy, everyone would have solved it by now, so three years isn\u2019t that long. I\u2019ll put the primer ideas down now and then come back to discuss; today is oddly overbooked with items that control the success of the coming week, so I don\u2019t quite possess the time to do this correctly in one go. First, some background. I have had the pleasure to work with and train a group of athletes in the 45-70-year-old range. During that time I progress myself from 45-54 after having started in the biking space at age 19. I have done the time-crunched athlete myth myself and coached others through it. I have watched person after person doing that approach; make incredible gains; experience margin success, and then crash and burn from injury or burn out many not to return\u2026 So I bring that bias, I am ok with that, it\u2019s a demon I\u2019ll have to fight like everyone. I also want quick, easy wins so the siren song of time crunch solutions is tempting\u2026 Fortunately, maturity has taught me to drop the ideal of \u201cquickly\u201d from my models and redefine what \u201ceasy\u201d means so I can resist. So what\u2019s the driving goal of many people I work with? Simple, they want to ride or race bikes; I get both types. They all want to experience a more comfortable ride; they want to go fast outside, and they want to stay fit either competitively or for the sake of health. Oh, and if they see a bike in front of them, they want to chase that rabbit and show no pain as they pass them. It should sound familiar, and you all can fill in the blanks. Everyone one loves to talk while everyone else can only suck air. When people stumble on me and the help I offer, they are all aerobic disasters; they have no base built because they train or ride in Tempo on group rides or are locked into the time crunch FTP chasing ego cycle. So for myself and my circle, once I noticed this pattern I set about trying to find a better way to do it; and as luck would have it I found Phil Mafatone\u2019s writings and decided he might just be onto something. So let\u2019s test it! I lean towards a lab scientist any how (Engineer by wallet is my preference, you never know until you put it on the road). After a bunch of research and self-testing, we used this to coach up an over 50 mixed-gender RAAM relay team of four. Using this approach, they broke the record for a team of four.

After a bunch of research and self-testing, we used this to coach up an over 50 mixed-gender RAAM relay team of four. Using this approach, they broke the record for a team of four.

(Yes that opening is a mess because it discusses the past with the foresight of the future) So on to it, first FTP everything is FTP. FTP is a blessing and a curse. It\u2019s time to move beyond FTP and start thinking about Critical Power and specifically Critical Aerobic Power and Critical Anerobic Power. If you know your CAP(s), you know your abilities. Failing back on MAF is the way to make this transition easier. Very few of us will go out and do the ventilatory testing to figure out what our Aerobic thresholds are, and we don\u2019t have to if we are either (1) starting training off the couch, (2) already well-trained at the end of a season. In those cases, the formulas Phil put forth do work. Only the 3rd group of Time crunched \u201cfit,\u201d but unfit people will struggle because that\u2019s not about training. It\u2019s about ego and bro science. Ok, so MAF first, let\u2019s go with the most robust stance. MAF_Basis = 180 - age If you are severely detrained or currently sick, then MAF_Adjust1 = -10 Else MAF_Adjust1 = 0 EndIF If you take daily medicine that has a liver load (aka heart meds, allergy meds), then MAF_Adjust2 = -5 Else MAF_Adjust2 = 0 EndIF If MAF_Adjust1 + MAF_Adjust2 = 0 and you have been athletically training for three years plus without a significant injury, then. MAF_Adjust3 = +5 Else MAF_Adjust3 = 0 EndIF So with those in hand, we know that the final estimate that works for pretty much everyone is MAF_Threshold_Estimate = MAF_Basis + MAF_Adjust1 + MAF_Adjust2 + MAF_Adjust3 Now you have your MAF_TE to work with. And, of course, everyone in group three believes that (MAF_Basis + MAF_Adjust3) is them and that it\u2019s too low. And reality shows that 90% of people are really (MAF_Basis - 15) Ok, hopefully, you\u2019re with me so far. That part was the easy part; here\u2019s the part I will have time to cover today Let\u2019s look at how we\u2019d use an existing training software with a similar name to TrainerDay and one with Volcanoes. In that software, we work with FTP, and for this exercise, during the BASE building phase, we will treat Critical Aerobic Power as FTP as displayed in those apps. Start with a Traditional base plan that is a low-volume or mid-volume plan in said software. One that\u2019s 100% endurance riding with recovery weeks. Watch out for things that claim to be traditional-based but have tempo and other work in them for \u201cvariety\u201d. Also, an Endurance ride is always >= 90 minutes. You will have to delete tempo work and find endurance work from prebuilt plans. (If you have a training-peaks account, you can get me to build your plans, and I\u2019ll load one of many combinations for you, but really anyone can do it). If you are off the couch, guess your FTP and enter it into the software.",

So I know that may sound like gibberish BestBikeSplit is for sure the best at determining your race strategy and your race strategy dictates your training strategy. Because of all this, this is why we have avoided build a specific TT block in Coach Jack. To simplify generally you you have a hilly route you want to focus your last block on 100-120% and if it is flatter it\u2019s probably more like 100-110%. I would do a custom plan (click harder) like below, starting about intensity level 3-7 depending on how long it is and how you feel. image2022\u00d71414 246 KB This creates some serious blocks. image2358\u00d7442 51.5 KB\n\nPost 5 by Robert_UCL:\nAgree! I would also test how big your anaerobic capacity is, so you can completely empty the tank in those 30 minutes. You can do this at the end of an lsd training or a zone 4 training. The VO2 max training should feel very uncomfortable when you are doing them. Save the longest blocks for the last four weeks and don\u2019t forget to use a short taper, so you will be at your fittest when you race.",

        "text": "YouTube Video: A Simple Cycling Training Plan: The Four Pillars of Performance\n\nTranscript:\nare you tired of struggling to keep up with your Cycling group or feeling slow on your solo rides do you want to increase your speed or improve your performance well the good news is that getting faster on your bike can be simply achieved by adhering to our four performance pillars keep watching because at the end of this video we offer a special bonus tip a cycling performance booster hi this is Alex from trainer day trainer day is an indoor outdoor training platform I work closely with Andrea Morelli Andrea is one of the top evidence-based cycling coaches in the world together we will bring you simple concise training advice optimizing your training volume is the first and most important pillar to improving your performance complex training plans and Magic workouts are unnecessary until you're approaching the limits of your personal performance Frank Overton of fast cat coaching is credited with being the pioneer of sweet spot and TSS based cycling in the following video clip Frank emphasizes that increase training volume alone is usually the key to your best seasonal performance and you know did you train more in 2019 than you did in 2018 if you did I bet you had a better season this would suggest that Frank also believes that volume is a more critical Factor than specific workouts or plans we would add to that and say that the right volume at the right time will usually provide you with your best results so what does the right volume at the right time mean it means rearranging your yearly cycling hours by decreasing at certain points in time and increasing others can yield substantially better results even if you're a time crunch cyclist pillar number two consistency it's optimal to have very consistent weekly patterns in your training volume if you're like me this may not happen if you have an incredibly busy week instead of your planned workouts you could fill it in with some very short indoor workouts evidence shows that 10 minute hit or Tabata session 20 minutes including a warm-up can augment your training gaps number three recovery performance gains happen during your recovery periods sleep is the most important method of recovery if you don't sleep at least eight hours a night eight plus being ideal start by turning off any screens an hour before your desired bedtime you can also try the weight lifter secret of taking zma zma contains the vitamin zinc and magnesium it's healthy and it works and it does not create the groggy morning feeling like melatonin if you train consistently patterns of daily weekly monthly and yearly recovery have been the gold standard for many decades for maximizing results taking a day or more off each week a week or more off each month and a few weeks off each year as well as a base period each season will give your body the rest it needs to increase to the next level if you have been cycling consistently and eating well but flatlined in your performance not having the right recovery pattern is probably the reason our fourth and final pillar is about workouts evidence suggests that if you are training six hours a week or more spend most of your time following low heart rate easy rides the start of your season could be all easy rides and slowly as your season progresses you increase the intensity for many cyclists going easy is more difficult than going hard getting fast requires self-control your harder workouts don't need to be complex and you don't need to kill yourself but you will see benefit from following a progressive overload pattern this means slowly and systematically increasing either your intensity your duration or both as Dr Seiler of polarized training points out hard efforts don't need to be incredibly hard and should be sustainable we take that a little further and suggest that you can start with easy intervals and build to hard intervals the polarized Studies have also proven that lower intensity weeks can beat higher intensity weeks so be very careful when you're trying to substitute intensity for volume for most cyclists the most important overload is regarding a weekly long ride you should try to fit in a long ride each week and start small and continually build the duration to your maximum occurring around a month before any event we feel that software platforms and many coaches have put too much emphasis on highly structured training that we also agree that simple moderate sustainable intervals will add horsepower to your already volume-based aerobic engine Outdoors Hills are a great place to do workouts either hill repeats or longer Hills can be Optimum higher intensity intervals and Hill training is most important as you get closer to your peak season ideally this follows a pattern of progressive overload as well and for our bonus tip popular and pro cycling in recent years during your peak season add full effort intervals this means pushing yourself to the maximum for two to",

        "text": "We are actually working now on a new visual design on the training tab including what I feel are the most requested and most useful features. I have cadence targets in this new design so I will share it soon so people can verify they agree with the approach I am talking.\n\nPost 11 by OldManToy:\nThanks Alex. Perhaps it\u2019s both. Initially I was talking about the display in the app, but the cadence target would be for each interval. Therefore I assumed the cadence target would need to be set in the erg or mrc files via editing in the website, but I can\u2019t remember if cadence is a data field in those files as I haven\u2019t tinkered with any files for a while now. For my use I don\u2019t see the point of setting a cadence target that\u2019s one value, or even a range, for the whole workout. Does that help?\n\nPost 12 by Alex:\nOh, I see, actually we don\u2019t send ERG/MRC to app so yes cadence targets in the app are somehing we are working towards and yes it would be per interval. The biggest thing I am struggling with is I want to keep it simple and clean. Target Cadence will only show up if there is one. We really only have room for a single value. So in the editor you could say 100-120 but in the app it would just show 110 but go red if you go under/over 100/120. We tried designs with smaller range but too many people struggle with smaller fon\u2019t and it did not look as good/simple. What do you guys think about a single number, is that acceptable?\n\nPost 13 by OldManToy:\nI think a single number at the mid point of a range is fine. TBH I\u2019d set a single number for the target cadence in the file for the interval but expect the app to allow either a percentage or set numeric variance range each side of the target with the actual cadence display of green font for on target(for the range), then switching to red if outside that variance range. If it\u2019s easier/better/user-majority-preferred then setting a range as the target is also fine. Perhaps the key point with a single value display for the target is that the actual has variable font colour for on or off target but that font colour change should be based on a range because cadence varies so much. Does that make sense? Obviously this is only my opinion!\n\nPost 14 by Alex:\nYes if you look higher in this post you can see how our editor works now with 100-120 so I prefer to just use that and we can set the mid-point. Makes less development and keeps the app and the site consistent and yes the color would be if you are out of range. So we are basically saying the same thing. Good to hear that seeing a single value is reasonable from your perspective. That is what I am hoping everyone will say. It seems fine by me but my cadence drills are so easy that I don\u2019t even need it in the app.\n\nPost 15 by MedTechCD:\nI think I agree with @OldManToy. You don\u2019t even need a target field.

If you are off the couch, guess your FTP and enter it into the software. If you are ending the season and rebuilding, take your current FTP and use FTP-15. If you are in Ego group 3, then just use your FTP and follow the rest of the rules and put the ego in the garage. Begin riding your first endurance ride. Complete the warm-up. Then 5 minutes after the warmup, If your measured HR is below MAF_TE, then increase the difficulty of the workout using the percentage gauge or equivalent mechanism. If your measure HR at any time is close to going over MAF_TE, then decrease difficulty. During the Peak parts of the workout, you want to be in the range of MAF_TE - 10 <= Measured HR <= MAF_TE -5 That\u2019s the sweet spot for the peak of the workout. When building the workouts, we want at least 30 minutes total to be that intense. Never less that that; and sometimes a lot more minutes to put cardiac drift strain on the athlete. A workout that forces the person to keep lowering the difficulting to keep the HR in the zone; is not a bad workout; it\u2019s an Endurance building workout. (((Important not to see those as failing because it\u2019s not))) Overshooting MAF_TE is to be avoided at all costs. One minute over can derate the workout about 80% so don\u2019t do it. Re-read this until you understand it Cardicate drift is going to happen lower the difficulty is HR training; it\u2019s not a failure\u2026 Continue to adjust throughout the workout. After the workout is done, consider what your average % adjustment was that kept you just under MAF_TE Adjust your FTP estimate by that %. If step 6 felt like +6% then increase FTP +6% if step six felt like -20%, then set FTP to FTP_estimate * .8 repeat starting at step 3 on the next ride. By the end of 2 weeks, you should find that you have to do little to no adjustment, and you\u2019ll be pretty close to an FTP that complies with your current Critical Aerobic Power base. Finish the rest of the six to ten weeks on a traditional base. Six weeks if you are resetting after a season. Eight weeks if you are a recovering FTP junky, and ten if you are off the couch or trying to lose weight. During this time frame, you adhere to: MAF_TE - 10 <= Measured HR <= MAF_TE -5 If you have the time, you can loop through the base phase for as long as you like. Each loop-through will build more and more CAP. This is great for older folks or injury recovery. With the traditional software, you can watch your progress via CAP expressed as FTP. When FTP stops going up for an entire loop, then it\u2019s time to move to Polarized no matter what. Now credit where credit is due.",

I think you should add more cadence to your exercises. motivates more in more focused exercise and notices an improvement in the athlete\u2019s fitness\n\nPost 12 by Alex:\nOk it\u2019s easy for us to add more. Maybe I should make it a setting that a user can adjust. Lot\u2019s of cadence work for example. We are not convinced it makes a big difference at least in the short term, but in the long term we do believe it can help some people and probably the right amounts of consistent cadence training could make a bigger difference. I will make a seperate task for this. You are a vote for more\n\nPost 13 by gomeskiller1:\nYes Alex, I\u2019m not saying that in exercise there are cadences in everything but rather where the work is more focused on the athlete. For example, at the beginning, for example, if you are going to do hits, it is normal to do one or another gradual exercise at a 90 to 100 cadence during the warm-up. so that then n HITT of 30s at 1m at 400W with 90 cadence at 1 second hitt 95 and so on. In the equal threshold exercise. That hug and whatever you can help, send a bomb\n\nPost 14 by Alex:\nOh that\u2019s interesting. I am talking to Andrea about this and he works more with pros. So I am not very familiar with cadence work myself. This makes sense. I like this idea. I will ask some more coaches as well. The translation of what you sent is great!!! I don\u2019t know if you use ChatGPT for translating but it is a very good translator. Especially for complicated stuff.",

You can actually \u201clearn\u201d Cda from the data if you have accurate wind measurements. I tested future wind predictions but they\u2019re totally unreliable - every API gives different results and none match actual airport conditions even an hour away. I could also add section power targets with elevation mapping if useful, though without W\u2019 input it would be less accurate.

When I do this, on one time intervals.icu shows all of the interval markers from the workout, but for two other workout sessions it does not. Is there a problem with the exported .fit file?\nContext: User is trying to upload workouts to intervals.icu.\nUser Problem: Inconsistent detection of interval markers in uploaded workouts.\nAnswer: I believe interval markers is a feature of intervals.icu and not something included in the fit fit file (I am pretty sure we don\u2019t include anything) so it would seem intervals is better at finding those intervals but maybe an intervals expert here can help clarify. @MedTechCD Want to help\nSolution: Suggests that the issue may be related to how intervals.icu handles interval markers.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thanks both for your fast replies! I think I have it figured out now. The first TrainerDay session that I uploaded to intervals.icu, intervals.icu had correctly identified the intervals itself. However, the second ride had \u201cmicro intervals\u201d and then these were not properly detected. Then, the third ride had only small intensity variations, so no intervals were detected. Still, after opening the exported .fit files in Strava, I could see all the lap markers were in the exported file. So, I then deleted the sessions in intervals.icu, activated \u201cUse laps for intervals\u201d in the Settings, and reimported the session .fit files. After doing this, I see all the laps from the TrainerDay session. I have now re-verified, and having \u201cKeep all laps\u201d activated is not enough. What had added to my confusion on this is that, when I do a TP programmed session outside using my Garmin, when the Garmin .fit file auto-uploads to intervals.icu, I see all the Garmin laps when only \u201cKeep all laps\u201d is activated in the Settings. Somehow, the TrainerDay .fit files require that \u201cKeep laps for intervals\u201d is also activated. However, maybe that is as it should be\u2026\nContext: User explains their troubleshooting process and findings.\nUser Problem: Confusion over settings required for proper interval detection.\nAnswer: I disagree on that\u2026 Every other app controlling structured workouts, logs step markers (laps). I have never used the FIT or TCX from Trainerday because I always dual record on my head unit, so can\u2019t be absolutely sure. But if Trainerday isn\u2019t logging a step marker in the output file, that is wrong behaviour because it should. I suggest you check it out and add steps asap if they are not included.\nSolution: Suggests checking the output file for step markers.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: dalex: Somehow, the TrainerDay .fit files require that \u201cKeep laps for intervals\u201d is also activated.

With the synchronization functions to TrainingPeaks and Intervals.cu it has become even better! Perfect for me I\u2019ve been doing a lot of Zone2 the last 9 months, and my aerobic endurance has improved extremely. Right now I\u2019m doing a peak block with a little more intensity to get ready for a few alpine passes in early September. I would like to switch to polarized training after that. I find the suggested VO2max sessions from CJ to be too short in terms of interval length, and too intense. I would like to do longer VO2max/Threshold intervals on the intense days. So for example beginning with 4x4min @105% or max 110%, then slowly increase the interval length to 4x8min or similar. Is there such an option in CJ? Best regards Tom\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nThanks so much. Your training sounds perfect and your VO2max plan sounds very good as well. We have these custom progressions, you may have seen, but we don\u2019t have one like that. We could add that as a new progression but not sure how quickly you need it. I guess hand building this workout sequence would not take much time, create, clone, use our sets and reps, tweak and repeat. My guess is a sequence of 10 could be done in 30 minutes. In CJ we would start at lower level maybe 4X2 and build up but you could just increase intensity slider to get to 4x4 as your starting point.\n\nPost 3 by R2Tom:\nThat would be great to add another progression, and as I wrote, I don\u2018t need it right now, somewhen in fall / winter (in Europe) would be sufficient. Otherwise I will add custom workouts to the calendar, if it\u2018s not implemented then. I have to say, though, that it really would be easier with CJ (and that\u2019s why I like this feature so much!). Adjust workout length, intensity or something like that, and with two clicks it\u2019s synced with the calendar\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nI understand completely. I like this sequence so I will try to get it done.\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nOk, I forgot it is not so easy building a sequence like this I am doing it in code in simple string format which is way faster than our workout editor, not to mention I am pretty good at doing these sequences. I also had Coach Andrea review and did a few revisions until he accepted it and spent like 2 hours. But the good news is this is done. It will be available in the next few weeks. The sequence starts \u201ceasy\u201d but goes to extremely hard as the intervals get longer the % of FTP actually goes down. It goes all the way to 4X8 but Andrea says he has never prescribed a workout this hard to any of his athletes. But I always push it so if someone cranks it to start with intensity 10 and does 16 weeks they can end at a place that is barely or not survivable for most. Really by definition you should not be able to do 1 interval > 6 minutes @ VO2max but since none of this stuff is perfectly accurate it is possible for some crazy guys to do this sequence to the end. You should be happy with this. Below you can see what it looks like. Each line represents the workout main intervals. image1456\u00d71590 356 KB\n\nPost 6 by R2Tom:\nWow, looks perfect Nice that Coach Andrea reviewed it.\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nYes, I would say Andrea reviewed and fixed my \u201cbugs\u201d or improved it at the minimum",

This is done and available, see below. Rather than ramp rates we use block start and block end hours. It\u2019s the same thing just simplified. Also now it easier for new coach jack users to realize they can control the hour limits on each day, just a bit faster and easier to set. See below. Now we will start working on some CJ workout improvements coming in the next month or so, including some cadence skills work and more enjoyable workouts as well as slightly more performance optimized. image3108\u00d72158 606 KB",

That is a long time at 50% or less, it takes 10 minutes to get over 50%. Would it be better to ramp up faster? image946\u00d7497 17 KB Regards Dave\n\nPost 3 by Alex:\nHi Dave, this is a very interesting questions and have a few sides to it. So I worked with Andrea on these warmups and from his opinion this is reasonably optimum. Realize he is generally focused on top quality. It also depends on a few factors like how high your FTP is, if you FTP is 400w then starting at 160w is fine For pros, low intensity is not as easy as it is for the rest of us. Also depending on if you use a ramp test many people have over inflated FTPs again probably an extra safe warmup. On the other side with workouts in general you need to balance peoples expectations, enjoyment with \u201ctheoretical top quality.\u201d Since so many people come from the mindset of TrainerRoad, and other platforms and time crunched they feel they need to feel intensity asap. Our main goal was to push the main work back a bit and the easy and best way seemed to be to extend the warmup. So ultimately I think you are right from a user enjoyment and expectation stand point we might need to improve this warm-up a bit more. I think the down sides to not being \u201cperfect\u201d are not very big. Just an FYI AI agrees 5-10 minutes of very low intensity is the right way to start image1612\u00d71150 95 KB\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nSo the goal of all these changes was to maintain the primary value the Coach Jack workouts provide, while making incremental improvements in quality (rider results) while still optimizing to not increase training stress significantly with what we believe is minimal value. The other is to make the workouts more enjoyable. Here is an example of double warmups. image1888\u00d7998 42.8 KB So here is an example of extended main work on progressions. While this would be harder than a single effort of main work, it\u2019s only incrementally harder. image1918\u00d7642 53.4 KB Micro sprints added to Zone 2. This zone 2 is not the same as below AeT zone 2, so for those that want true zone 2 then it\u2019s better to use our heart rate mode. This just provides a bit of activation without the stress of higher intensity. image1904\u00d7988 46.1 KB Our belief is that people \u201crace\u201d best at their natural cadence but doing some cadence drills and slightly pushing higher than your natural cadence can help increase your natural cadence. If you use strava it will check your natural cadence and set targets accordingly. image1864\u00d7954 64.3 KB\n\nPost 5 by R_Em:\nlooks good! would these apply to existing workouts in my current CJ plan?\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nThese have slowly been rolling out over the last month.",

In the equal threshold exercise. That hug and whatever you can help, send a bomb\n\nPost 14 by Alex:\nOh that\u2019s interesting. I am talking to Andrea about this and he works more with pros. So I am not very familiar with cadence work myself. This makes sense. I like this idea. I will ask some more coaches as well. The translation of what you sent is great!!!

Yes, the idea I gave is very basic, but you can start there. Another thing that I detected, but I don\u2019t know if they told you, is when you have the training in watts and convert it to HR it gives some crazy values. Alex, another thing we need to develop quickly is different types of training focused on each discipline. If you need help, let me know.

I love chatGPT but for most users it\u2019s going to produce the wrong suggestions unless they are good at digging in. Using AI For Training Has anyone tried to use ChatGPT, etc\u2026 as a training sounding board or as a coach? If yes, how has this experience worked out for you? I told ChatGPT what my goal is, what my current level / constraints are, and worked with it to come with a plan that seems to be a sensible approach to get there. Dave I am working on a new model that uses LLM to help generate a training plan but does so in a way that it is not going to cause poor plans and users will clearly see the mistakes with tags that are inappropriate. Heuristic Tag Model. So user inputs text based request which uses ChatGPT to convert those into user and plan tags. There would be thousands of different tags possible. The user could review the tags and make sure they are accurate Then we can use machine learning to match the tags to your next training block. We won\u2019t allow building a full plan at one time but just one block at a time. We can ask for weekly feed back to adjust the current block and then build the next block based on how goals change and how the current block goes. Advanced users could even generate their own custom training blocks from LLMs. Here are some first thoughts on this image2442\u00d71682 430 KB So this is AI for training block generation but it would be more focused on one block at a time so more dynamic in general.

        "text": "Forum Discussion: How to create workouts like Morpheus heart rate suggestions\nCategory: General Discussion\nTopic Type: Training Execution\nPosts: 8\n\nPost 1 by Bdo811:\nIs anyone using a Morpheus heart monitor? They have prescribed zbit training programs that I\u2019m wondering if anyone has made TrainerDay programs for (they are various 60 on 10 off etc) I find it hard to figure out how to pedal to keep up with the changes in the program and before trying to crate the workouts myself wondering if they exist. Thank you\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nThat\u2019s an interesting product. I just did a brief look. It\u2019s a cool idea in general but I need to look at it more. So when you say program in I assume you mean program in HR targets? Right now I want to remove all public workouts (I don\u2019t think there are very many public ones now) with HR targets since we use specific HR not % of threshold or something else. Our workout creator is super fast and you could even use ChatGPT to generate excel spreadsheets possibly and then copy and paste the workouts into our editor (just an idea).\n\nPost 3 by Bdo811:\nThey have a set of workouts for the zone 2 recovery part. They look like this IMG_84091290\u00d72573 126 KB IMG_84101290\u00d72569 226 KB\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nOh that\u2019s a unusual prescription of intervals when talking about heart rate 5-10 second intervals all out. So you should use our slope mode intervals not HR intervals but then you could do ERG to drop the power and then do HR intervals for the recovery and press + button to extend the workout. This is interesting and hard but unusual use of HR. This might require more explanation on how to create this workout as prescribed in TrainerDay but I think you can do a good job of it\u2026 Let me know.\n\nPost 5 by Bdo811:\nIs there a way to program that so that TD mirrors what their app is trying to get you to do?\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nYes but realize for example \u201call out\u201d or as hard as you can is not something you can program, it\u2019s something you must do. You can program very hard in ERG but any particular day you can be stronger or weaker. I will post an example of how to program this.\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nSo there are multiple approaches to how to solve this problem. One is the \u201cperfect\u201d way from a TrainerDay workout creation standpoint which is design the workout exactly true to what they are saying. Like this image image2464\u00d71884 412 KB For the 2 minute HR segment press >> button to extend 2 minutes to what you need it to be during the workout until you get to z2/blue zone (turn on our zones in settings). Next time you can set this to the time you actually need, some people might be 2 minutes some might be 5 minutes. I feel that is a bit complex, I would do it simpler (I can explain a simple workout if you need) Another final way is do it more like outdoors and do it all manually. And just not program it Click on quick start and click slope mode for 1% Warmup watch your HR so it gets to the top of zone 2 Increase slope to about 4-6% Shift gears and go as hard as you can for 10-15 seconds lower slope to 1% or shift down and watch your HR until it gets back to Zone 2,6) Repeat step 3,4,5 - 10+ times cool down\n\nPost 8 by Norsemanfit:\nI found these two workouts worked well with my Morpheus HR targets. 1st one called ( there is no try ) IMG_05401125\u00d72436 175 KB",

From what I understand, he wants to move all intervals by 4 sec up because the turbo has a response time around 4 sec. So I don\u2019t think there is a solution. You can\u2019t do that for multiple intervals at the same time.\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nStrange, I don\u2019t ride a lot, short rides a few times a week, but I also have a Kickr V5 and don\u2019t have any issues like this. In general the Kickr does have a 2 second delay from the time we send the target power but we automatically send it 2 seconds before the desired change so that it changes at the desired time. So specific individual trainers, not models, have errors that occur. It sounds like this is the case with yours. The spike is even more strange. Again TrainerRoad has some magic tricks that we have not figured out how to do. Unlike the Kickr, a Tacx neo is almost instant. What phone or tablet are you using? Do you have any other devices connected?\n\nPost 6 by matmal:\nMaybe an additional device setting with an offset. To be honest this is really long, normally 2s delay I wouldn\u2019t bother but this is ranging from 4-6 seconds.\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nLike I said on my KickrV5 it is totally right on time. So at this time you are the only person I know with a problem, so I prefer not to add just a slider for you and figure out how to fix your problem. Are you saying yours is totally reliable that it happens every interval or most? If so are you willing to work with my developer?\n\nPost 8 by madmalkav:\nSorry for the slight off topic, but is the power target supposed to happen as soon as I get the audio prompt, or is the audio prompt sent a little earlier to get you ready? I do see a delay between the audio and the power target being displayed on the screen and \u201cfelt\u201d in the legs, about 2 seconds or so, and I don\u2019t know if it is intentional or just a little lag.\n\nPost 9 by Alex:\nIt\u2019s 2 or 3 seconds earlier so you can prepare for the change.\n\nPost 10 by matmal:\nHi again. So Like I promised some time ago. I tested this software both on KICKR v5 and KICKR BIKE v1. The delay exists in both of them but worse is with KICKR v5 (latest FW). The biggest problem is at the start of the interval. The end is usually happening immediately (1-2s delay). Why do I consider this a problem? Imagine an interval workout of N-15s attempts. The interval power is reached after 6-7 second after start of each interval. The end of the interval is quite fast, as mentioned above. In summary this will not be a good training. Thing to observe Although start of the interval has a step change of power (not a ramp) it behaves like a ramp - I mean the trainer is simulating a ramp. Usually when a new power sets in, rider prepares for a change in intensity. Because of this delay the general feeling is mediocre. I know this can be fixed, because this problem does not exist on TR and at this moment this is one of the least attractive things about TD.",

Once the cursor was also kind of frozen but the intervals changed. It only happened once and I also fiddled with split screen too much.\nUser Problem: Interval and total time discrepancies\nAnswer: Oh thanks, yes I put this hear to hear from more people that might not normally speak up.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: As an additional data point, I have had this issue on an iPhone 8 (using a Keiser M3i converter). Current work-around: restart the phone, only one other app in the background (for music) make sure to keep the TrainerDay app in the foreground Restarting the phone seems to matter. Only doing steps 2 and 3 didn\u2019t work for me. (Perhaps restarting shuts down some background processes?)\nUser Problem: Timing issues with the app on iPhone 8\nAnswer: That\u2019s terrible. Thanks for sharing. We will definitely fix this. It\u2019s so strange for 95+% of the people and 99% of their rides it works perfectly but one experience like this just destroys confidence. As mentioned this type of issue is mostly older devices but I know that does not matter to the person with the problem and we want to support older devices.\nSolution: Acknowledgment of the issue and commitment to fix it.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Hi Alex, Relatively new to the app. I did a 90min trainer session on Sunday and it was a difference of 11 minutes compare to my Garmin. I was using iphone 12 and with the latest IOS version. What can I do to resolve this? Thanks\nContext: New user experiencing timing issues\nUser Problem: Significant time discrepancy compared to Garmin\nAnswer: For now a phone restart and limit background activities and putting the app in the background but we are working hard to resolve this right now and can hopefully have something to resolve it in the next week or so.\nSolution: Restart phone, limit background activities.\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: i had this issue last night: was controlling my tacx neo v1 from my iphone 13 pro. seen it a few times before but not this bad: time was really dragging, every second was taking several seconds which was very painful on the harder intervals. then after an epic grind it went crazy fast for the rest of my ride.\nContext: Experiencing severe timing issues during workout\nUser Problem: Timing issues causing workout disruptions\nAnswer: Sorry to hear. Crazy on 13 pro. We are working on multiple solutions to this right now. It\u2019s something related to device performance, low battery is an example, but obviously it\u2019s a problem that needs to be solved with our app.\nSolution: Acknowledgment of the issue and mention of ongoing solutions.",

        "text": "That happened other times i\u2019ve noticed it too, like it wants to get the time back in sync all of a sudden. Trainer Day is the activity I\u2019ve been talking about btw, feel free to mess around with the data if it helps.\n\nPost 19 by Alex:\nSo the way this works is we progress \u201c1-second\u201d at a time. Every time we move forward 1 second we check the elapsed time and make a micro adjustment in milliseconds to try to catch up or extend it. So we actually do what you are suggesting. What we believe the problem is that a persons system can\u2019t do all the required processing in 1 second so even though we are trying to catch up we can\u2019t. We are are fairly sure the re-drawing of the chart is the performance problem so right now we are changing chart drawing technologies to something more native to the device and faster. Hopefully this solves the problem. If it doesn\u2019t the next step we realized we could do is if the system gets to a point that it can\u2019t catch up we could just drop a second to catch back up. That is our new \u201crevelation\u201d to a sure fix. Finally as you suggest we can record time stamp with each second and at the end do a clean up process to make sure the output file matches what you did. That is a serious workout wow you are tough. This has now become our absolute top priority to fix before this winter and we are 100% sure we will fix it one way or the other.\n\nPost 20 by njs50:\nI do like to do some longer rides to catch up on movies, and I wonder if they are more likely to trigger this. Not sure if it\u2019s just the charting causing it to get behind in my case. My suspects are bluetooth being weird, or incoming notifications in the background causing the initial desync. Then I think once it gets out of sync it seems unable to recover. The weird thing is for most of the ride it\u2019s slowing me down, which makes me think that it thinks somehow i\u2019ve gotten ahead of where I should be. Then the weird turbo speed bit at the end seems to indicate it can go a lot faster when it wants to. How about checking the elapsed real time vs how long the interval has been running for and declaring time bankruptcy as soon as we hit the point where the interval should have finished. Or I guess conversly extend it if we get to the end of the interval but not enough real time has elapsed. Then at least if things get out of sync it\u2019d only be for one interval of the workout but the overall interval and workout lengths would be correct. Another option might be to stop redrawing the chart whenever we get out of sync until things are back on track. I\u2019m happy to run a debug build if that\u2019d help track it down. Occasional whacky interval times are still better than my garmin crashing in the middle of a workout",

It seems to mostly affect older phones but some issues to new phones as well. We have thousands of app users and only a few issues reported but we want to be very proactive in improving the performance and timing issues that do occasionally occur. Here are a few issues One iPhone 6 user had 1 time issue related to time that seemed off One Pixel Pro 6 user had an issue of it recording 2X the speed One Keiser M3i user had issue when app went to background the cursor was not in sync with the target. I am just going to merge all timing related issues to this thread.\n\nPost 2 by raddirad:\nI also had the interval and total time off by 5 seconds twice. Once the cursor was also kind of frozen but the intervals changed. It only happened once and I also fiddled with split screen too much.\n\nPost 3 by Alex:\nOh thanks, yes I put this hear to hear from more people that might not normally speak up.\n\nPost 4 by whatevs:\nAs an additional data point, I have had this issue on an iPhone 8 (using a Keiser M3i converter). Current work-around: restart the phone, only one other app in the background (for music) make sure to keep the TrainerDay app in the foreground Restarting the phone seems to matter. Only doing steps 2 and 3 didn\u2019t work for me. (Perhaps restarting shuts down some background processes?)\n\nPost 5 by thx_1138:\nHey! I have had a similar problem lately. After pausing the workout to take a phone call, I resumed, but the intervals started too early (watts increased, while they should not according to the display), then the clock ran too fast (approximately two seconds per second). Really weird! I have attached two screenshots. The first shows the workout how it appeared during the session. Notice how weird the watt tracking line jumps around on the time axis: workout_during1024\u00d71757 211 KB The second shows how the workout looks after finishing it in the desktop app. The watts are completely out of sync with the plan. workout_final1501\u00d7481 55.5 KB This is really broken for me. Haven\u2019t used trainerday since. I am running Android 9.\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nThat\u2019s terrible. Thanks for sharing. We will definitely fix this. It\u2019s so strange for 95+% of the people and 99% of their rides it works perfectly but one experience like this just destroys confidence. As mentioned this type of issue is mostly older devices but I know that does not matter to the person with the problem and we want to support older devices.\n\nPost 7 by Ela5:\nHi Alex, Relatively new to the app. I did a 90min trainer session on Sunday and it was a difference of 11 minutes compare to my Garmin. I was using iphone 12 and with the latest IOS version. What can I do to resolve this? Thanks\n\nPost 8 by MedTechCD:\n@alex I think there is more going on then performance issues of the devices.",

I created a workout last week that had a figure of 0.1 sec in the offset column and none of the comments worked during the workout? If I leave it as 0 it says I must enter a value\u2026? Can this not be left at 0 so when the block starts the comment appears? I rely on comments quite a lot as some of the workouts coach sets are complex. If not 0 then what should I enter in this column? Apologies if this has been covered but I couldn\u2019t find anything.

Workouts I started at 06:00 am are displayed in Intervals.icu, runalyze.com and Healthfit with a starting time of 08:00 am. I\u2019ve looked at the TCX files and I saw that old files hat the starting time saved as UTC and the new files as UTC+2. Could you please take a look at that.\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nYep, we are on it.\n\nPost 3 by ababnz:\nMy workflow for getting my TD workouts to Garmin is to get TD to export then to Dropbox and then use RunGap to import the Dropbox file and export into Garmin. Reasonably painless and easy to achieve on my phone. This worked beautifully up until Friday when I suddenly started having a new problem. The workouts are still going into Garmin fine and the intensity minutes (the main thing I care about) get counted for the correct day but the workouts are getting loaded into the next day. I presume this is some timezone issue as they\u2019re showing up at the GMT time as if it\u2019s in my local timezone. Any thoughts on what is causing this? Thank you\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nYes, sorry sorry. We were adding timezone and we caused a bug.

        "text": "Blog Article: Importing a Route is Cool\n\n# Importing a Route\n\nThis is a very simple import process, if your route has power it will show you the same targets you have. If it does not have power it will give simple power estimates but this is not made for optimizing route performance. It also shows the same slopes.\n\n#### Importing routes have three key features.\n\n**Number One:** If you ride a route outdoors, you can download it as TCX or GPX and assuming you have a power meter and power data when you import it you can ride it as ERG mode in many apps. We will add FIT file import soon.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1dVRLJrpMNc2IMhnCL-BYJg.png)\n\n**Number Two:** If you find or create a route using google maps, RidewightGPS, strava routes or your friends maps, you can download the GPX or TCX and import WITHOUT power data and we will create power estimates for ERG mode. Now I would not say this is overly accurate as people ride hills all kinds of different ways, but as you go from 0% to 20% slope grade, you will find the power target getting harder and harder.\n\n**Number Three\u200a\u2014\u200aThe coolest feature.** Is slope mode in our app (coming soon). If you want to ride the same slopes, similar to training effect as right hills in Zwift, but without the cartoons we will automatically convert elevation changes into slopes. When we add this automatic slope mode in our app, you can go in and out of slope vs ERG automatically. We and many others feel that for sprinting on an indoor trainer slope mode is superior. ERG does not allow for dynamic sprinting. We will add a video and more information about this soon on this page. We expect this to launch in September 2021.\n\nThis feature is not good for TT race pace planning. I mean if you did a route previously and like the powerout put you did, sure you could repeat this and get good at it, but taking a route and using our power estimates will not produce anything useful for TT race pace. You should use Best Bike Split tool for that but it is complicated and you should have a pretty good idea of your aerodynamic drag to use it (cDA).",

For outdoor cyclists we are going to analyze all the cycling routes in each users area and provide a suggested route based on their training goals. We will extend TODAY to have a simplistic goal and improve the logic as to it\u2019s daily suggestions. That will include routes and after looking at the route details you will see some of the good suggestions for workout options. It will be mostly a free ride on the route with some intervals in a specific place or places. We are working on this now so hope and will launch small steps towards this soon, including estimating route completion times, which could even be a simplified version for TT races. image1280\u00d7824 87.7 KB",

I just know Garmin / Wahoo have problems regarding structured workouts. Garmin does not support the idea of \u201cFree-Ride\u201d for example. The idea of open-ended intervals is something most people don\u2019t know about or use. Garmin needs watts not % so when your FTP changes you need new workouts\u2026 A bigger screen and a company focused on continuing to improve the outdoor experince could evolve to something better (although I don\u2019t like the idea of phone on bars either, other than for indoor). Garmin basically does not seem to care much about a device after they sell it. They are not drastically improving their structured training experience. I also hear there is a trend towards moving to apps for training but since their are no good ones I know of I don\u2019t know how this is possible. Jeremy you are the perfect candidate for this, meaning guys training with a Garmin, if they could get over the idea of having some big phone on their bars could have a better solution for outdoor structure training. The Garmin might be there too, but the app for driving the workout. Right now we might be ahead of our time on this. That new Karoo Hammerhead has promise in this regard. So it could be virtual power based for an audience that does not have a power meter. Just GPS and weight and elevation changes (and wind ideally) could give a fairly accurate power.\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nI should say I am not trying to convince anyone of anything here This is very possibly some features that most people don\u2019t need and for sure this audience.

I only use the phone on my bike outdoors, I think it is much more forgiving, versatile and powerful than Garmin or Wahoo computers.

Honestly after using SYSTM and TR, then finding no \u201chome\u201d in Zwift or the other \u201csimulation\u201d platforms, TD was the one that pulled me out of a slump and helped get the traction I needed to find a consistent balanced approach.

I use an Apple Watch for HR when using a Wahoo Kickr Core trainer indoors and have been searching for a good app to use for outdoor HR based training. It was during these searches that I discovered that TrainerDay previously had an outdoor mode. It must have been removed just before I started using TrainerDay. It\u2019s a pity it has been removed because TrainerDay seems to have the most reliable/stable Apple Watch connection that I have found. If GPS and outdoor features have been removed from TrainerDay, are you aware of any other apps that can display HR data from an Apple Watch? I don\u2019t think CheckMyRide has this feature. I\u2019ve trialled Cadence, but found that the Apple Watch connection can be problematic (and usually requires the Watch to be rebooted before it will work).\n\nPost 16 by Alex:\nHi Mike, yes only 11 people ever recorded an outdoor workout using our app so we dropped that feature and no one complained\u2026 With HR based workouts are you trying to do interval workouts at say Z4 for example?

Dave\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nSo we don\u2019t have any perfect solution for this, but really all you are talking about is specific power targets in specific places on your route. The best way to do this in general is to focus on the climbs or just a few key targets on the route. Then use either our editor or in Garmin connect you can set specific distances and ours you can not. But I would avoid distances and times completely and just use open ended which means you start the workout\u2026 When you get to your first climb you press the lap button and it will go to your target watts. See below how to do that in our tool image1536\u00d7950 49.9 KB See below Garmin\u2019s workout creator. You could use distances just for the climbs for example.

Suppose you could create such a file. If tomorrow\u2019s weather brings you a strong headwind, it will take you much longer to ride the same route. Or maybe our body isn\u2019t as fit as usual, because you didn\u2019t sleep well. Or maybe there is more traffic on the route, slowing you down. These factors, which you can\u2019t control, will bring a lot of stress to do things right. Alex\u2019s suggestion of using the lap button for the sections that matter is great. Part of training outdoors is adjusting to the freedom of the road, trying to enjoy the environment, while taking advantage of the challenges your route brings you. The way I do that is by looking at how long certain sections usually take and finding a specific workout for this section. Sometimes I adjust the workout so it fits perfectly into my situation. Where I live, everything is flat. I can ride 200km with only 100am. For strength training on the bike, I use a tunnel nearby. It is a 300m climb with an 8% gradient. That takes me about 30secs with 60rpm. I ride down and do the same again. It is the most boring workout I have in my library, but it works. The upside is that the tunnel is cool in summer and provides shelter from the wind, so it isn\u2019t really cold in winter. Another example is a route that I like at about an hour, by car, from home. There is a climb which is about one 1km long with an average gradient of 7,7%. The start and the end are 3-4 % and the rest is 12-14%. The nice part is that I turn left at the top, and the road leads me back to the base of the same climb. It is a great climb for either a long zone 5 interval or a short zone 4 interval.",

But since Garmin removed the option for slope workouts I was a bit lost. Pleased to see that TrainerDay supports this and I agree that it is very quick and easy to create workouts. As the title suggests I tend to use Slope to define the workout. It would be handy to be able to define the slope in a sets/reps workout. At the moment I need to switch between sets/reps and \u201cslope & hr\u201d views to input the slope data. A small inconvenience but I thought I would mention it, in case this was not intentional on your part. As I have quite a lot of variations of workouts I\u2019d planned to use Excel to create the tables. I noticed that I had to add a few empty columns into the Excel sheet to make the Excel data align correctly in the TrainerDay table. Again, a small problem but mentioned in case others use Excel to build the data. I saw other posts mention using Excel to calculate slope based on power/cadence. Steve\nContext: Steve is transitioning from TACX's app and is trying to adapt to TrainerDay's features.\nUser Problem: Need to switch between sets/reps and slope & hr views to input slope data.\nAnswer: Hi Steve, the problem is we don\u2019t have room at the moment for additional columns with sets and reps. That would be 2 more additional columns or some type of re-design. While I like it, sets and reps and slopes would be more of a rare use case from what I have seen.\nSolution: No immediate solution; acknowledged the limitation of current design.",

Has not been asked before. I would say mode is more legacy and less useful but we still use it for Coach Jack for example when converting indoor to outdoor and simplifying structure. It used to be that you could have comma separated value but now you can\u2019t. Do you have any specific needs for mode values like active and rest? Because really this should primarily be used for slope, erg and hr when creating workouts. Yes, if you have type as slope it will auto switch to slope.

But from physiological point it doesn\u2019t matter as it depends on the actual form of the day. If you really want to train in a zone you must design your training in the middle of the zone or a few percentage away from the limit e.g. at 58% or 72% (dependent on your trainer and the accuracy of your powermeter as well). Absolutely agree with that. If you train with zone targets, stay away from the limits. But people tend to think that chasing the upper limit of the zone is \u2018better\u2019. In fact, it\u2019s detrimental because you end up with way too much time out of your target zone. Just target the middle of the zone and allow yourself to wander within the zone iso. keeping that same target value. But as @app4g responded, I think the request is about workouts with a fixed target and how far you would be allowed to differ from that target. And since Power is intrinsically a metric that jumps around quite a bit, you will need about 5% tolerance, or you need to set a moving average (3s or maybe even 5s) for power readings. Newguy: Is 10\u00b1 watts ok or should you be closer to target. I don\u2019t know what the answer is Any normal training workout will not be influenced by this. There\u2019s no need to be exactly on a Power target. You need to be around the target to train the physiological adaptation.\n\nPost 16 by Alex:\nI am suggestion this. So you can see below my target zone is orange (VO2max) and my actual zone is Anaerobic (red), but because I am not off by more than 5% the actual Watts number of 226 is still white, or it could be grey for example. image1402\u00d71290 115 KB It\u2019s obvious I am in the wrong zone because of the color differences but it\u2019s not so serious that I need to change the color of the watts to red. Does this make sense.\n\nPost 17 by Alex:\nI fully, fully agree with this. The problem is someone just grabs a workout from our library and it is already at the limit. I would be better if people targets were always in the middle if they truely wanted to try to be more likely to match the physciological effect with the math theory Mostly this feature is for people that are in slope mode or don\u2019t have a smart trainer. ALso it would not turn red if you don\u2019t turn on zone modes. If you have a smart trainer in ERG mode you should choose your zones by picking your workout.\n\nPost 18 by MedTechCD:\nThat is totally confusing to me. Partially because you are not following the colors that most people are used to (the garmin ones: Grey=Recovery, Blue=Endurance, Green=Tempo, Orange=Threshold, Red=VO2max and Purple=Anaerobic). So here is my try at it: For target, color the numbers in the physiological zone color For actual watts, color the bar or background only when out of range. Use a single color (red?) no matter if it is low or high. That way it is clear that the Target color and the watts color are giving different information.",

I\u2019ve been able to figure out what my HRs will be at for different watt settings. I\u2019m tracking watts and corresponding HRs on an Excel sheet, then got the equation for the trend line. To monitor HR during a workout I switch back and forth between average interval watts and BPT. I have the VASA powermeter connected to a Scosche Rhythm24 on my arm. I see my HR on the TD app by switching back and forth from the Average interval watts. I have my Garmin Swim chest HR monitor connected to my Garmin watch 945 LTE.

It\u2019s supposed to be private, that I was sharing with my designer Target watts or target percentage is the same thing, just a different way of looking at it. Your FTP is the power you can do for 40-60 minutes. Say that is 200 watts for simplicity. So 140 watts and 70% of FTP are the same thing just two different ways to look at it. That way our blue charts look the same for everyone but stronger riders the watts will be higher but percentages will be higher because they have a higher FTP.

I did a work out today that was: 5 minutes warm up @ 40% in ERG 10 minutes @ 135 HR The graph output from this is: image1144\u00d7493 44.7 KB My HR was low after the warm up was ~ 103 BPM. It took about 8:46 to get close to the 135 BPM target at 132 BPM and then it controlled at about 124-131 BPM for the next minute plus until the interval ended. Is the ramp up supposed to happen at this speed? Should have I given a higher wattage in ERG mode so it wasn\u2019t so far away and could control sooner? If HR is set to 135 BPM what is it actually attempting to control to? ~ 130 BPM? I tried to merge a different work out at this point and ended up aborting. I imagine the 10 minutes I had here is not what it was designed to support. Is it really supposed to work with intervals that last 30+ minutes? Dave\nContext: User describes a specific workout setup and issues with heart rate control.\nUser Problem: Difficulty in achieving and maintaining target heart rate during intervals.\nAnswer: Hi if you do 5 minutes ERG warmup 1 minute ERG at 70% and then 9 minutes at HR target it will ramp up instantly. Right now by default HR does slow adjustments to get you to your target. Having a starting higher power average (from ERG) will start HR from that point. Make sense? You might want to go, 5% under target to give a small ramp like below. image1016\u00d7290 21.5 KB\nSolution: Adjust the workout to include a higher power average to improve heart rate ramp-up.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I thought the BPM target would be the heart rate, but you have 70, which is more like an ERG target.

Let me make the question more specific. I\u2019m using the HR function to do indoor zone2 training. But zone2 is a band, with lower and upper limits. To make it worse : to define zone2 \u2018exactly\u2019, one would need a lab test with lactate (and even then there\u2019s still debate where exactly it is). My question is : I worked out that my zone2 must be somewhere between 100bpm and 128bpm. With some room for an error margin in it. What would now be the HR target with the \u201cbest\u201d expected adaptions? Is it something like 120bpm, or rather 110\u2026 110 is clearly much \u201ceasier\u201d.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about the optimal heart rate target for Zone 2 training.\nAnswer: It\u2019s all debatable but I would say up to 120, so in our app just setting 120 should rarely go over 120. It\u2019s better to be a little under than over (in theory and according to Maffetone).\nSolution: Set HR target to 120 bpm.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: How was your 128 calculated? I\u2019m in this zone 2 discovery process too and my resting HR is 53 and max after 20min threshold test was 178. Only percentage of max HR way of calculating would take my zone 2 limit as low as 123bpm. Most of the other ways of calculating I have found (karvonen, HRR, British cycling method) Z2 limit is anywhere from 139 to 155 bpm. I think I\u2019m just going with the perceived exertion breathing test now.\nUser Problem: Confusion about how to calculate Zone 2 limits.\nAnswer: Threshold shouldn\u2019t have you hitting your max HR. You max should be higher. 20 minute warmup followed by 3 sprints with 2nd and 3rd being all out for a minute or so will. Slope mode is good for the 2nd and 3rd. I have a workout that is a test for max HR.\nSolution: Use a specific warmup and sprint method to determine max HR.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: I did the threshold test recommended on the British cycling method. Warm up 20 min, ride at a sustainable pace for 30 min then take the BPM average of last 20 min. I didn\u2019t look at my HR numbers during the test just did it on feel and checked after. Was this not the right way? Edit. I did sprint at the end.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about the validity of the threshold test method used.\nAnswer: Oh sorry, I did not clearly look at your numbers. I see you are using thresholdHR to determine zone 2, not max HR, so that is fine it might even be better.\nSolution: Using threshold HR for determining zone 2 is acceptable.",

So in this case you could create them in CSV and then to excel / copy paste\u2026\nSolution: Create a workout in TrainerDay, copy it to Excel, and then work back and forth.",

I think I found a bug. Let\u2019s say I create a workout like this: Minutes FTP% Type Slope% :30 50 slope 0 :30 100 slope 1 :30 150 slope 2 :30 50 slope 0 It will correctly start at 0%, then switch to 1%, then 2% but then instead of going back to 0% it will stay at 2%. If I change the last interval to 1%, then it will correctly work. It seems the issue is when you use 0, the app treats it as if no value is provided! I would consider this a bug. Would you agree? Thanks, D.\nContext: User is creating workouts with specific slope values.\nUser Problem: The slope value does not reset to 0% as expected.\nAnswer: Oh interesting. Definitely sounds like a bug.

You can only do smart slopes in our training app. Smart slope workouts are especially perfect for short-intervals. On many smart-trainers ERG mode is not good for short- intervals. I think all trainers are bad for 5-second intervals in ERG mode. Science has shown that very short intervals can be a great minimalistic method of training.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0hGttUAsyWEYot4iW.png)\n\nSprinting in slope mode by shifting gears and increasing cadence makes it more like an outdoor sprint. Smart Slopes or automated slope mode allows the trainer to change slopes automatically, similar to Zwift except that you are programming the slopes. Slope workouts are very individual.\n\n**Slope mode workouts require practice.** Practice in creating the perfect workout and practice executing the workout. We will start creating a list of recommended slope workouts, but you will still need to perfect your gears and cadence to hit the targets. When you are creating workouts, you are setting the slope, but you are also setting the target power/percent. This target power is a visual representation of what you are trying to hit, but since you control the power output by changing gears and cadence, it\u2019s only a reference point.\n\n**Mixed slope and ERG mode.** If you have ever taken a 20-minute FTP test or 8-minute FTP test on most platforms, they go in and out of ERG and slope or resistance mode. You can design your own workouts to do exactly the same in TrainerDay. Any interval you can change to slope or erg just by clicking the switch in our app.\n\nSee our editor before on how to create slope workouts. You don\u2019t need to set slope in the interval type unless you want it to automatically change for you.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0pEOaLR0G1vagKEA9.png)\n\nTo use smart slopes you must have a premium account.\n\nIf you have a premium account now, you can start creating your first workout in our [workout creator.](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/create)\n\n[Upgrade Now](https://trainerday.com/pricing/)\n\n### A great example slope\u00a0workout\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0cymNak6fNn-586IU.png)\n\nHere is a [link to that workout](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/4-second-intervals)\n\n[https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/4-second-intervals](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/4-second-intervals)\n\nThis workout first increases slope right before the 4-second intervals. Then you should shift and increase cadence and go as hard as you can for 4-seconds.\n\nHere is a study showing this can be great for general fitness, but 4-second workouts can be fun when you need something else to do as well as bringing great sprinting benefits. **You must have a trainer that is capable of more watts than your 4-second limit.**\n\n[https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/fitness/four-second-interval-workouts-may-be-all-it-takes-to-maintain-fitness-and-strength-1.4654140](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/fitness/four-second-interval-workouts-may-be-all-it-takes-to-maintain-fitness-and-strength-1.4654140)",

        "text": "Blog Article: Mixing And Matching Cycling Modes For Indoor Training\n\nTrainerDay and other platforms have different modes for smart trainers and smart bikes. ERG is the most popular for workouts but even though we are the biggest ERG workout platform, we believe in a more wholistic approach. ERG is great for a specific purpose, but the other modes are great as well\n\nThe Four Modes of TrainerDay\n\n**Mode 1\u200a\u2014\u200aERG**\n\nERG is perfect for a few cases. One is when you just want to watch a movie or not think about the training itself but hit specific power targets. This is specially good for training in Zones 1 thru 4. It can also work reasonably well for Zone 5 with some adjustments. Most workouts are designed around your FTP but there is a [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|problem with workouts that are Zone 5 or higher.]]\n\nGenerally ERG is the main workhorse of indoor workouts. We believe training should be more dynamic based on how you feel, but ERG works well, you must might want to press the + or - buttons in our app at times. You don\u2019t need to kill yourself on the days that just feel a bit off.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1qQAVHxMXHWGJQWp3uWB0vQ.png)\n\n**Slope Mode**\n\nOur app has slope mode which you can instantly switch to at the click of a button. You also can design workouts that automatically switch to slope mode with a specific slope angle (design your own hills).\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1V3lIJfwpM6Ho4iv-r19e0Q.png)\n\nSlope mode is great because you can use your gears and cadence to control your power output and you can decide how closely you want to hit your desired power targets for each interval. It\u2019s just like Zwift but you can ride at a sustained specific slope as long as you want and more easily control your power output. ERG mode does not work well on short intervals, how short depends on the trainer you own but some where around 10\u201315 seconds are as short as works well in ERG mode, in that range it\u2019s better to manually control your power with slope mode. [[2023-01-01-smart-slopes-779c74a0c921.md|Read more here]]\n\n**Resistance Mode**\n\nResistance mode is like slope mode but instead up to a 25 degree slope (very rare to do 25%, 3\u201310% is more common) you specify resistance from 1\u2013100%. The actual power output depends on cadence and your specific model of trainer. We do not have any automatic resistance mode but really slope and resistance are the same and slope mode is more standardly used. You can switch from allowing switching Slope mode to using Resistance mode in our Other Settings.\n\n**Heart Rate\u200a\u2014\u200aHR Mode**\n\nHeart rate mode is a very specific mode that automatically controls your trainers power target (ERG mode) based on your target heart rate. If your heart rate is too high it will lower your power target and the opposite if it is too low. It moves very slowly giving your heart rate time to catch up. This works as a limit not an average. Meaning if you say 120 limit we try to keep it just under 120. Some people like ERG for the warmup and HR for some good Zone 2 HR based training.\n\nYou can see in this video you can design workouts that atomically switches in and out of any of these modes.\n\n[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK87_Seu658)",

What is the ultimate goal for VO2 efforts to get adaptations\u2026 Thanks all that have made it to this part. Cheers Leigh.\nContext: User is seeking advice on improving a specific workout and understanding heart rate targets.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about how to optimize the workout for better results.\nAnswer: Hi, funny, I just went on a ride and was thinking about how to answer this question\u2026 Let\u2019s just say this question can result in a million different opinions. The easiest answer is what is the reason for doing that. I just asked ChatGPT and this is a reasonable answer (see lower on this response). So in general you are talking about nuanced differences and while someone might sound really smart and give a solid reason why one or the other, this is highly individual and no one really know what is going to work better for you. Enter the workout fully recovered, get a good warmup and I believe if you take a structure approach to slowly increasing intensity or duration then ultimately it does not matter what you do, the difference would be so small and you would never know. If one sounds more fun then the other, take the fun one We are strong believers here in the last part of ChatGPT\u2019s answer which is * Progress Gradually: Start with shorter, less intense intervals and gradually increase the duration and intensity as your fitness improves. We (Including my partner and top pro coach) would say pros should take this exact same approach. Start out lighter and gradually increase. I probably did not give you the best answer but it\u2019s our beliefs around here. ChatGPT VO2 max workouts, also known as maximal oxygen uptake workouts, are designed to improve an athlete\u2019s aerobic capacity and overall cardiovascular fitness. Here are the key reasons behind incorporating VO2 max workouts into a training regimen: Increase Maximum Oxygen Uptake: VO2 max represents the maximum amount of oxygen your body can utilize during intense exercise. By improving VO2 max, your body becomes more efficient at transporting and using oxygen, which enhances endurance and performance. Enhance Cardiovascular Efficiency: VO2 max workouts help strengthen the heart and improve the efficiency of the cardiovascular system. This leads to a greater volume of blood being pumped with each heartbeat and more efficient oxygen delivery to working muscles. Improve Lactate Threshold: High-intensity intervals push the body to work at or near its lactate threshold, which helps to increase the point at which lactate begins to accumulate in the blood. This means you can sustain higher intensities for longer periods before fatigue sets in. Increase Aerobic Power: VO2 max workouts increase the power and speed you can maintain aerobically. This is particularly beneficial for endurance sports, as it allows for higher sustained speeds. Enhance Recovery Ability: Regularly performing high-intensity workouts can improve your body\u2019s ability to recover between efforts. This is due to improved blood flow and increased efficiency in clearing metabolic byproducts from the muscles. Boost Overall Performance: By improving aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, and recovery, VO2 max workouts contribute to overall athletic performance. This is particularly important in sports that require sustained efforts, such as cycling, running, and rowing. Typical VO2 Max Workouts VO2 max workouts generally involve high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which includes: Intervals: Short bursts of high-intensity exercise (e.g., 3-5 minutes) at or near your VO2 max, followed by rest or low-intensity periods.",

My only problem now is that when i go from doing a HR+ quickstart Z2 session to an actual workout on a differnt day it doesn\u2019t switch back to Erg mode. Would be nice if erg based workouts switched it to Erg mode. Now that my HR+ target isn\u2019t resetting it can take me quite a while before I realize i\u2019m on the wrong setting and not doing anything like i\u2019m supposed to be doing. oops.\nUser Problem: The app doesn't switch back to ERG mode after a HR+ session.\nAnswer: Cool, yes. Ok but unless you specify it is ERG we don\u2019t know it is an ERG workout. If it is specified it should automatically switch although I am not sure we ever tested this for the first interval going from quick start or merging. See below how your workouts need to look. Let me know if this is what you have and it is not working. image1462\u00d7758 67.4 KB\nSolution: Specify ERG for workouts to ensure automatic switching.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I\u2019m mostly just doing random workouts like this while it\u2019s off season: Trainer Day - Workout: SST (Long) i thought workouts scaling off ftp would be erg based by default. the graph doesn\u2019t really make sense if you do a workout like that in HR+ mode.\nContext: Off-season random workouts\nUser Problem: Confusion about workout scaling and ERG mode.\nAnswer: Not exactly because some people for example like to do % of FTP workouts (for a visual example of what the workout is) but just click slope so they can set it to manual slope mode and control power with gears and cadence but their target is still % of FTP. The same could be said with resistance mode. I have not given this enough thought yet but it\u2019s possible that almost everyone switching from HR+ warmup to selecting a % of FTP workout would want it to default to ERG. We are in uncharted territory and this is the first someone discussed this.\nSolution: Consideration for defaulting to ERG for FTP workouts.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: fwiw in the editor it looks like: all FTP%, which I would think would make it an erg type? this is why I fall for the trap: the first 10 mins almost matched what i was supposed to be doing, and by the point i\u2019m off track i\u2019m distracted watching netflix. oops.\nContext: Using the editor for workout planning\nUser Problem: Confusion about workout type and mode switching.\nAnswer: PS it\u2019s interesting it started matching your target interval slope. That is random I think, but some how HR+ target seems like it was affected by selecting another workout. I don\u2019t remember exactly how that works. I will think about this more.\nSolution: Further investigation into HR+ target behavior.\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: sounds great, in the meantime i\u2019ll clone some workouts and set them to erg on that first step Was kinda hoping coach jack would be able to setup a polarized plan with HR based zone2 rides combined with some Erg based high intensity rides. If that ever becomes possible hopefully the generated rides will switch the mode for me.\nContext: Looking for workout planning options\nUser Problem: Desire for a specific workout plan setup.\nAnswer: Yes this is something I also want to do to. CJ with HR+ and more towards traditional polarized. You can do it now. Create a 1 day a week plan with VO2max blocks (or VO2max crunched) in Coach Jack and then just create an HR+ workout and add it to you calendar for the other days of the week.\nSolution: Instructions on creating a polarized plan with Coach Jack.",

Does this mean that if I switch to erg mode in the app, it will switch back to slope at the start of the next interval (if both intervals are marked as a slope interval type)?

In other words, how do the interval type and app mode interact?\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nExcellent question. Has not been asked before. I would say mode is more legacy and less useful but we still use it for Coach Jack for example when converting indoor to outdoor and simplifying structure. It used to be that you could have comma separated value but now you can\u2019t. Do you have any specific needs for mode values like active and rest? Because really this should primarily be used for slope, erg and hr when creating workouts. Yes, if you have type as slope it will auto switch to slope. We used to allow a blank value there with a slope and then it would just not auto switch back, this feature was accidentally recently lost when we introduced HR mode in the editor. We could allow this again if there is a reason to have it. This means it stays in ERG for example until you click slope rather than auto switch. I guess you could do this now but you would have to specify the slope value in the app not in the editor.\n\nPost 3 by ydubb:\nI really don\u2019t have any need for warmup/cooldown/active/rest (although I like the open-ended option for workouts I would take outside). What would be most helpful is to have some kind of option to control the auto-switching behavior. Maybe there was an additional \u201cauto\u201d button on the app (next to HR/ERG/SLOPE) that would auto-switch based on the mode specified in the workout and the specific mode buttons are \u201csticky\u201d and override the mode written in the workout.",

Which makes them think about what device would be best to use.\nUser Problem: Users might select more than one device for the same metric.\nAnswer: It should all be automatic and they don\u2019t need to select them and also you can\u2019t select more than one service.

Now know to double check to see if the required features are enabled on the kickr!\nContext: Encountered an issue with ERG mode during a ride.\nUser Problem: Features being deselected unexpectedly.\nAnswer: Oh no sorry to waste your time.

I will think about this more.\n\nPost 7 by njs50:\nI think it\u2019s just that the HR ramp up to target is similar to the ramp up in those workouts. When I look at the types col in those workouts I see this: Seems like maybe that type col has dual purposes, and perhaps things which change the trainer/app mode i.e slope/erg/hr should be their own thing. Maybe when switching to a non HR workout which doesn\u2019t set the mode it should go back to the last non HR mode you were in. That or the settings could have a default workout mode for the people who dont like erg mode (is it because they are riding outside or not on a smart trainer?). Anyway, just a few thoughts I can def live with the way it is atm. It just seems like something that a few people might run into if they do quickstart HR workouts on a regular basis.\n\nPost 8 by Alex:\nYes that column has multiple effects but wu/active/rest stuff is more relevant to outdoors and erg/slope/hr is more about indoor. Also due to the width of our page we don\u2019t have room to add any more columns. It seems that this solution has worked so far. In your case, yes you have multiple options (create clones of workouts and add ERG to first one) or as you said just click ERG after the warmup. I think switching to ERG at the start of a merge from HR+ likely is better for 95% of the people (actually probably 100% = 1 person, you ). But since you are training in what I feel, is my favorite style of training I am extra sympathetic to this request. I moved this to a feature request so it does not get lost. We won\u2019t do it right away.\n\nPost 9 by njs50:\nsounds great, in the meantime i\u2019ll clone some workouts and set them to erg on that first step Was kinda hoping coach jack would be able to setup a polarized plan with HR based zone2 rides combined with some Erg based high intensity rides.

        "text": "Forum Discussion: Private Workouts Are Indexed and Viewable to Others\nCategory: Technical Issues\nPosts: 6\n\nPost 1 by amsgator:\nWorkouts marked as private are being indexed by Google and are viewable by people other than the \u201cowner.\u201d This makes them not private and presents a potential issue with custom/coach-created plans being disseminated to people they shouldn\u2019t be. Is this intentional or perhaps just an oversight? Example: This workout is indexed and viewable to me even though it shouldn\u2019t be. https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/thimble-5/\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nWhat\u2019s interesting is we are around for 7 years now and you are the first person to mention this. First thing is, that workout is a strange one in that it is private and indexed by google. Maybe it changed it\u2019s status from public to private, but we will investigate. Private Workouts: Generally private workouts are not indexable and I verified others are not. So if they are not indexed and not searchable in google in general the way to find them is via sharing. Second is if you think about the underlying concept of workouts, they are not copywritable unless they include music or dance and their is nothing special about an individual workout. We have 40,000 public workouts which covers basically every case. So making sure they are absolutely locked down and unsharable even with your friends or building a secure private sharing mechanism does not make a lot of sense to me. As you can see we do try to indicate this. Private Plans: Regarding coaches making plans. First of all TD is not a platform for coaches in general and when and if a coach makes a plan in TD, that plan should be for an individual or comes with guidance that makes the plan more relevant for that individual. Without this that is just a plan and no one really cares about some random coach that made a plan and they want to \u201csteal it\u201d and use it for training and if they did it would be such a small number, it does not matter. You must have a paid TD account to access private plans so that also limits the exposure. Even when public plans get created by coaches they don\u2019t have any more interest to our users than other free plans. So I know I/we have touched on a sensitive area here, just giving my thoughts and as I said since you are the first person out of hundreds of thousands of users to mention this I think the problem is not severe.\n\nPost 3 by amsgator:\nIf it\u2019s not something brought up before then perhaps it\u2019s not worth the effort, but simply adding a noindex tag to private workouts would at least omit them from search engines. From what I can tell, there are over 300 indexed private workouts in Google. This may be a small sample size when compared to the total number of private workouts, but it\u2019s definitely more widespread than the example I provided. I just found it interesting. If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth devoting any attention to, that\u2019s cool also.\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nWe have 400k+ private workouts, so seems to be some kind of \u201csmall\u201d bug but yes thanks for pointing it out.",

We know if someone cloned a workout, we could remove the clones that are similar, that\u2019s a good idea. TrainerDay does not create workouts except when it is dynamically generated as part of a Coach Jack plan (other than the 20 free workouts and a few random ones). So all workouts are user generated. But I recently recognized that we need to start doing more cleaning of these public workouts. Or somehow make it more clear what public means because people create too many public workouts these days In the beginning we wanted more and more but now we want less So you saying this helps keep it prioritized on my list.\nSolution: Start doing more cleaning of public workouts and clarify what public means.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Hi, Is there a way to avoid soooo many user\u2019s modified workouts on a search?

Been using this functions since forever\u2026 Is it gone or do I totally miss something ?\nUser Problem: Unable to find the button to copy a workout.\nAnswer: It\u2019s still there.

It\u2019s as often a typical MICROSOFT stupidity\u2026 The browser was in some unwanted (never asked for) update mode\u2026 (I worked there for 18 years, I never agreed to the tyranny of how they handle updates.

I would say mode is more legacy and less useful but we still use it for Coach Jack for example when converting indoor to outdoor and simplifying structure. It used to be that you could have comma separated value but now you can\u2019t. Do you have any specific needs for mode values like active and rest? Because really this should primarily be used for slope, erg and hr when creating workouts. Yes, if you have type as slope it will auto switch to slope. We used to allow a blank value there with a slope and then it would just not auto switch back, this feature was accidentally recently lost when we introduced HR mode in the editor. We could allow this again if there is a reason to have it. This means it stays in ERG for example until you click slope rather than auto switch.

My only problem now is that when i go from doing a HR+ quickstart Z2 session to an actual workout on a differnt day it doesn\u2019t switch back to Erg mode. Would be nice if erg based workouts switched it to Erg mode. Now that my HR+ target isn\u2019t resetting it can take me quite a while before I realize i\u2019m on the wrong setting and not doing anything like i\u2019m supposed to be doing. oops.\nUser Problem: The app doesn't switch back to ERG mode after a HR+ session.\nAnswer: Cool, yes. Ok but unless you specify it is ERG we don\u2019t know it is an ERG workout. If it is specified it should automatically switch although I am not sure we ever tested this for the first interval going from quick start or merging. See below how your workouts need to look. Let me know if this is what you have and it is not working. image1462\u00d7758 67.4 KB\nSolution: Specify ERG for workouts to ensure automatic switching.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I\u2019m mostly just doing random workouts like this while it\u2019s off season: Trainer Day - Workout: SST (Long) i thought workouts scaling off ftp would be erg based by default. the graph doesn\u2019t really make sense if you do a workout like that in HR+ mode.\nContext: Off-season random workouts\nUser Problem: Confusion about workout scaling and ERG mode.\nAnswer: Not exactly because some people for example like to do % of FTP workouts (for a visual example of what the workout is) but just click slope so they can set it to manual slope mode and control power with gears and cadence but their target is still % of FTP. The same could be said with resistance mode. I have not given this enough thought yet but it\u2019s possible that almost everyone switching from HR+ warmup to selecting a % of FTP workout would want it to default to ERG. We are in uncharted territory and this is the first someone discussed this.\nSolution: Consideration for defaulting to ERG for FTP workouts.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: fwiw in the editor it looks like: all FTP%, which I would think would make it an erg type? this is why I fall for the trap: the first 10 mins almost matched what i was supposed to be doing, and by the point i\u2019m off track i\u2019m distracted watching netflix. oops.\nContext: Using the editor for workout planning\nUser Problem: Confusion about workout type and mode switching.\nAnswer: PS it\u2019s interesting it started matching your target interval slope. That is random I think, but some how HR+ target seems like it was affected by selecting another workout. I don\u2019t remember exactly how that works. I will think about this more.\nSolution: Further investigation into HR+ target behavior.\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: sounds great, in the meantime i\u2019ll clone some workouts and set them to erg on that first step Was kinda hoping coach jack would be able to setup a polarized plan with HR based zone2 rides combined with some Erg based high intensity rides. If that ever becomes possible hopefully the generated rides will switch the mode for me.\nContext: Looking for workout planning options\nUser Problem: Desire for a specific workout plan setup.\nAnswer: Yes this is something I also want to do to. CJ with HR+ and more towards traditional polarized. You can do it now.

That is random I think, but some how HR+ target seems like it was affected by selecting another workout. I don\u2019t remember exactly how that works. I will think about this more.\n\nPost 7 by njs50:\nI think it\u2019s just that the HR ramp up to target is similar to the ramp up in those workouts. When I look at the types col in those workouts I see this: Seems like maybe that type col has dual purposes, and perhaps things which change the trainer/app mode i.e slope/erg/hr should be their own thing. Maybe when switching to a non HR workout which doesn\u2019t set the mode it should go back to the last non HR mode you were in. That or the settings could have a default workout mode for the people who dont like erg mode (is it because they are riding outside or not on a smart trainer?). Anyway, just a few thoughts I can def live with the way it is atm. It just seems like something that a few people might run into if they do quickstart HR workouts on a regular basis.\n\nPost 8 by Alex:\nYes that column has multiple effects but wu/active/rest stuff is more relevant to outdoors and erg/slope/hr is more about indoor. Also due to the width of our page we don\u2019t have room to add any more columns. It seems that this solution has worked so far. In your case, yes you have multiple options (create clones of workouts and add ERG to first one) or as you said just click ERG after the warmup. I think switching to ERG at the start of a merge from HR+ likely is better for 95% of the people (actually probably 100% = 1 person, you ). But since you are training in what I feel, is my favorite style of training I am extra sympathetic to this request. I moved this to a feature request so it does not get lost. We won\u2019t do it right away.\n\nPost 9 by njs50:\nsounds great, in the meantime i\u2019ll clone some workouts and set them to erg on that first step Was kinda hoping coach jack would be able to setup a polarized plan with HR based zone2 rides combined with some Erg based high intensity rides.

I saw this on the TrainerRoad forum and thought it was relevant and just saying more people using our app should use slope mode and try to hit their own targets. Many days just forgetting about what you are doing and riding in ERG is very valuable, but other days or at certain times paying attention is likely a good idea. I would say days that you are fearful that you are at your max level then it makes more sense to do slope mode. Empirical Cycling Ten Minute Tips #26: The Case Against Erg Mode Copyright \u00a9 2023 One thing I keep thinking about is how to build in more of an RPE focus, or get people thinking about RPE more. As this coach points out becoming very in tune with RPE is a good idea and we agree with this. I think like this guy at some level coaches should push people away from ERG because ERG tends to drive people to one of the software platforms as a coach, so I am nervous his strong opinion might have a bit of a marketing focus on it. But still overall it is something worth considering.",

I would say uninstall and re-install our app. I saw you commented on the Elite post too. Elite is popular for having issues but JB should work well. One of my friends has JB V1 and it works fine for him but again some times something strange occurs that re-installing seems to fix. If you have an Android device and if after a re-install you can duplicate this issue and willing to work with my developer we should be able to fix the issue.\nSolution: Uninstall and re-install the app\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Hi\u2026I tried reinstalling and then recaliberated via spindown and it seems to be working fine again now.

        "text": "Think of this way. In Erg mode, I want to the bike to create a calculated amount of work over a time interval regardless of cadence. This produces measurable results that can be used by coaches and riders to build and monitor a training plan. We get numbers like 400w for 1 minute. That\u2019s fits nicely in spreadsheet and everyone is happy. In slope mode (I have already adopted your term Alex - thanks), I want to do strength training. I want the bike to set an appropriate resistance that I use over a time interval. The overall (a.k.a., average) work performed during the interval is less interesting than the associated telemetry. What were the maximum watts I hit? How long did stay at a given power level? What\u2019s my HR relative to resistance? What\u2019s the function - based on something like linear-regression - that describes the work I did during the interval? I want it be a square wave. But often - especially in the beginning - the curve will resemble a reverse saw tooth. There are no convenient scalar values like 400w for 1 min. It\u2019s more like resistance * sin(t). This not something every coach understands but could represent an opportunity for the next wave of training apps. Hint. Hint\nUser Problem: Need for a mode that allows for strength training with appropriate resistance settings.\nAnswer: This is nice clarification. I agree with you but had never really internalized this. You can do this now with our resistance mode but it would be interesting to see how this would work with automatic resistance/slope changes. I know slope mode on trainers is technically different than resistance mode but I don\u2019t know how they actually feel different.\nSolution: Acknowledgment of current resistance mode and interest in automatic slope changes.",

MRC, ZWO and ERG files support ramps.\n\n**TrainingPeaks and Garmin do not support ramps.**\n\nSo TrainerDay has an algorithm that automatically converts ramps to steps trying not to produce just the right number of steps.\n\n**The problem with Garmin**\n\n**Garmin only supports up to 50 steps.** Generally, this conversion works great but Garmin only supports up to 50 steps total so you have to factor this in when trying to push workouts to Garmin. A workout like the one at the bottom of this page can not be pushed to Garmin. The ramps just increase the number of steps more. Workouts must be simplified.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-07edHXRV-WnnvSkUH.png)",

        "text": "Post 3 by Jukes:\nThank you as always for the quick response. Agreed that, from what I have read, you\u2019d need a variety of tests to get an accurate result. I was wondering primarily about your experience (actual or research etc) regarding the best increments in the ramps. If they are a set 20w, then the jump might be too big for smaller riders and they won\u2019t last the final jumps, so the test shows a smaller FTP than actual. If smaller jumps, 6% say (of the pre-set guessed FTP inputted to conduct the test, right, not 6% of the immediately preceding step), but you happened to have a big FTP, then you\u2019d be at a higher power for many more minutes before you reached the level at which you fail. Interesting that you find that you can basically sprint to skew the result. So which is fairer? Perhaps an example might help. Say the FTP is 220w and that\u2019s put into the turbo control to carry out the ramp test: 10% increments: 1 minute at; \u2026 110w, 132, 154, 176, 198, 220, (and then approx 20 seconds of the next step 242w, to give the 0.95 x best minute = 220w FTP) 6% increments: 1 minute at; \u2026 110w, 123, 136, 149, 162, 176, 189, 202, 215, 228, (and then approx 20 seconds of the next step 242w, to give the 0.95 x best minute = 220w FTP). In the second, you\u2019re doing more work, longer time, and in the latter stages at a higher intensity.\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nIn our test it does not matter if you finish the step because we take last 1 minute average power so the longer you go on any specific step the better. This is pretty standard approach. I was thinking like you but my personal testing shows it does not matter. If it changes a couple watts in results or even 5 watts by changing step size it does not offset the fact that your test is likely off by more than 5 watts anyway from 40-60 minute power and changing your training by 5 watts rarely matters. So all you need is consistency and a conversion factor (optional for most people). I don\u2019t think there is any research on this because a ramp test is not accurate enough that a step size will make much difference. Percent based actually evens it out a bit as lower FTP guys get smaller steps than bigger FTP guys. Also ramp tests are highly individual depending on your MMP (mean max power curve) that what is research going to prove? Andrea has tested thousands of elite cyclists (multiple every day for 20 years) in the lab and says his last minute power and it falls between 70% and 80% of that to match LT. They also test non-elites\u2026 We just use 75%. Now we are talking about elites and pros that are much more consistent genetically, training wise and physiologically. He can\u2019t accurately predict the difference just by looking at someone. If he looked at me, he could easily see I am more likely to be at the 70% or less More muscle mass, less in shape (fatter)\u2026",

Say the FTP is 220w and that\u2019s put into the turbo control to carry out the ramp test: 10% increments: 1 minute at; \u2026 110w, 132, 154, 176, 198, 220, (and then approx 20 seconds of the next step 242w, to give the 0.95 x best minute = 220w FTP) 6% increments: 1 minute at; \u2026 110w, 123, 136, 149, 162, 176, 189, 202, 215, 228, (and then approx 20 seconds of the next step 242w, to give the 0.95 x best minute = 220w FTP). In the second, you\u2019re doing more work, longer time, and in the latter stages at a higher intensity.\nUser Problem: Determining the best increments for ramp tests to ensure accurate FTP results.\nAnswer: In our test it does not matter if you finish the step because we take last 1 minute average power so the longer you go on any specific step the better. This is pretty standard approach. I was thinking like you but my personal testing shows it does not matter. If it changes a couple watts in results or even 5 watts by changing step size it does not offset the fact that your test is likely off by more than 5 watts anyway from 40-60 minute power and changing your training by 5 watts rarely matters. So all you need is consistency and a conversion factor (optional for most people). I don\u2019t think there is any research on this because a ramp test is not accurate enough that a step size will make much difference. Percent based actually evens it out a bit as lower FTP guys get smaller steps than bigger FTP guys. Also ramp tests are highly individual depending on your MMP (mean max power curve) that what is research going to prove? Andrea has tested thousands of elite cyclists (multiple every day for 20 years) in the lab and says his last minute power and it falls between 70% and 80% of that to match LT. They also test non-elites\u2026 We just use 75%. Now we are talking about elites and pros that are much more consistent genetically, training wise and physiologically. He can\u2019t accurately predict the difference just by looking at someone. If he looked at me, he could easily see I am more likely to be at the 70% or less More muscle mass, less in shape (fatter)\u2026\nSolution: Clarified that the last minute average power is what matters and discussed the variability in ramp tests.",

        "text": "Forum Q&A: Ramp Test increments\nCategory: Training Execution\nTopic Type: Training Execution\n\nQ&A 1:\nQuestion: Dear Alex I hope you\u2019re well. I did a TD ramp test recently and it got me thinking about the increases in the steps/ramping. Having looked into it a little it seems that there is a variety of approaches taken by different platforms; 20w increases, 6% increases and TD\u2019s own 10% (presumably of the FTP you\u2019ve already inserted in the app, not 10% of the previous step). I\u2019d guess that these would give different results as some people would find a 20w increase harder than others depending on their actual FTP (hence using a percentage). Conversely, small 6% increases mean you\u2019re pedalling longer at higher intensity before you reach the really hard ramps, which might tire you disproportionately quicker. how did you settle on 10%, just curious. Thanks for the insight (and app)!\nUser Problem: Understanding the rationale behind the 10% increment in ramp tests.\nAnswer: So our app is 100% percentage based. I can\u2019t remember where I found the 10% number but a ramp test is not super accurate in general for predicting 40-60 minute sustained power. Even a 20 minute test can be off but usually more accurate. I am on the extreme end of inaccuracy. My last ramp test was 230 watts but my actual FTP was probably closer to 200. So I know this about myself. I have a strong anaerobic contribution to a ramp test, especially the worse sustained biking shape I am in. So one aspect of a ramp test is getting you in the ball park for training percentages but our perspective it does not need to be perfect although at some point doing both a ramp and 20 minute or TT race or something to figure out your conversion factor is reasonable but we feel the more important value from testing is just monitoring progress and a ramp test is frequently more accurate than a 20 minute test in repeatable performance. Pacing can totally affect a 20 minute test. Also a ramp test is less painful for most so more easily repeatable and less disruptive. Coach Andrea has been doing lab ramp tests for 20 years or something and he always uses 25w steps with pros and elite athletes. My finding is 25w and 10% end up producing similar results. You can design your own ramp tests in TD. Anything with \u201cRamp Test\u201d in the title will automatically be treated like a ramp test in our app. So if you repeated start the test with the same FTP, you can create 20w increments in our editor and it will always be 20w increments, but even as your FTP changes you need to change it back to that original value. Either than or keep updating your test as your FTP changes. Let me know if you need more info on how to create watt based ramp tests, or if this answers your question.\nSolution: Explained the rationale behind the 10% increment and how to create custom ramp tests.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thank you as always for the quick response. Agreed that, from what I have read, you\u2019d need a variety of tests to get an accurate result. I was wondering primarily about your experience (actual or research etc) regarding the best increments in the ramps. If they are a set 20w, then the jump might be too big for smaller riders and they won\u2019t last the final jumps, so the test shows a smaller FTP than actual. If smaller jumps, 6% say (of the pre-set guessed FTP inputted to conduct the test, right, not 6% of the immediately preceding step), but you happened to have a big FTP, then you\u2019d be at a higher power for many more minutes before you reached the level at which you fail.

But what actually is bothering me much more is the power number shown in the box - Is it possible this to be set to 3s, or 5s power?

I guess some changes have been done already because in my workout yesterday the behavior was quite different. What happens now is that the line is pretty smooth all the time, which is working pretty good when holding steady power for longer intervals. The problem comes when there are big changes in power (for example start or end of interval) that it takes about 20 seconds to display the real power. Here you can see a few screenshots I made: Screenshot_2024-01-03-14-57-40-450_trainerday.turbo2400\u00d71080 80.8 KB Screenshot_2024-01-03-15-02-44-420_trainerday.turbo2400\u00d71080 79.9 KB In both cases immediately after the interval starts or ends line and watt number drops/increases slowly for about 20 seconds until the real power is reached.\n\nPost 20 by Alex:\nYes, it is going a bit slower than I wanted (power changes). We are going to allow turning it off. You can read here but we also need to improve it which we will do soon. [SOLVED] - Slow power changes between intervals Resolved Bugs and Issues We used to have it this way but it seemed like it caused confusion. We will start with on/off for now and then go from there if we need to add it back.

The power control was actually fine. I was doing 40/20 intervals. The power displayed had huge lag, it appeares to me that instead of the instantaneous powder the 15 or 30s average power was displayed. Enabling and disabling power smoothing in the app settings also didn\u2019t change anything. The power was controlled properly, the full interval power (350W) was there when the interval began and the power was reduced immediately (140W) after the interval was over. TD however displayed super slow ramps, as if I have only reached the interval power 12 seconds after the interval began, and it showed as if I never reached the low rest power. I recorded a video to show the problem I can provide it as well. Has anyone experienced something similar?

I was quite surprised to find about this new feature on today\u2019s training. When at first it seemed good as trhe power was shown more precisely, when I approached some harder Z4-Z6 intervals, I found it really hard to maintain stable pace with this 10s+ lag on power indicator. I prefferred the old way which was although quite imprecise (10% increments), allowed me to maintain given power much more easily with nearly real time indication. With this new way, I found my power fluctuating all over during the 3 minutes intervals in Z4-Z6. So, thanks for swift reaction and introducing the switch soon!\n\nPost 9 by Alex:\nYeah it dynamically tries to determine if it should be a 2 second delay or 10 second but to your point yes if you are not using ERG but trying to maintain power this would not be good. I did not consider this case.\n\nPost 10 by pze:\nI experienced this as well recently, with about 15 seconds needed to reach the target interval power. To me it also seems that the higher the cadence it is more difficult to reach/maintain the target. Could it be? I use combo Kickr Core + Assioma power meter. A further thought on the this setting - would it be possible to make the power smoothing adjustable, e.g.",

This workout had a constant power setting, however at the end there was a sudden spike of power for an unknown reason.Zrzut ekranu 2023-02-13 o 11.36.39|230x500\nUser Problem: The device is reacting to a change after 5-8 seconds, which is a delay compared to previous experiences.\nAnswer: What is your trainer? It\u2019s likely a delay or an error thrown in your trainer but TR is obviously much more mature so might have special code for your trainer to increase the target time they send it. We have thousands of users and this is the first time I have heard of a delay like this, although, other users had a problem where their devices throw errors and so what we do is keep sending updates which might delay it. TR might have some magic formula to dealing with these device errors that we are not aware of how to do. If you can repeat this regularly and be willing to work with my developer then we could find the source of the problem. It\u2019s good to know that TR did not do this.\nSolution: Work with the developer to find the source of the problem.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Sorry for the slight off topic, but is the power target supposed to happen as soon as I get the audio prompt, or is the audio prompt sent a little earlier to get you ready? I do see a delay between the audio and the power target being displayed on the screen and \u201cfelt\u201d in the legs, about 2 seconds or so, and I don\u2019t know if it is intentional or just a little lag.\nUser Problem: Confusion about the timing of the audio prompt and power target.\nAnswer: It\u2019s 2 or 3 seconds earlier so you can prepare for the change.\nSolution: The audio prompt is intentionally sent earlier.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: I came to the forum looking for an answer because I have a similar problem. When I start my session the app won\u2019t change the right power unless I manually decrease the wattage to 90% and change the power back to 100% after few sec when the app is starting to change the wattage. It\u2019s a small thing but very annoying. Other than this everything works flawlessly. My trainer is Tacx wheel-on model and I think this has started lately. Any idea why this is happening eg has there been any change in the Power Match or in the other code related to the trainer control?\nUser Problem: The app does not change the right power automatically at the start of a session.\nAnswer: Sorry to hear. Yes, we recently changed power control to fix a different device. That\u2019s the problem is sadly each device works differently and occassionaly an update to fix one negatively affects another. Surprising as the problem we fixed for one device is the problem you now have. Let me see if my developer can review or see any reason why this might happen. I will respond soon.\nSolution: Developer will review the issue.",

Seems like I need to do another kind of smoothing for this to make it more powerful\nSolution: Request for a screenshot to diagnose the issue.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Hi, I have actually recorded a few videos but cannot upload here. I was observing it pretty carefully during the last workout. What I noticed is that this graph smoothing happened probably three times through the whole workout. Here I captured the last one But it actually happened after the graph was drawn. So it is drawn initially as it is recorded with all the oscillations and at some point it smooths out. But what actually is bothering me much more is the power number shown in the box - Is it possible this to be set to 3s, or 5s power? Because when trying to hold specific power it easily jumps 10-15 watts up or down from the target wattage and makes it harder to hold specific power.\nUser Problem: Power number shown in the box jumps 10-15 watts up or down from the target wattage.\nAnswer: It\u2019s the same problem. The power number in the box should have the same smoothing applied to it as the graph, which should be smoothing in real-time (not every once in a while). We will have this fixed soon, hopefully the next few days or week but for sure the next 2 weeks.\nSolution: Acknowledgment of the issue and promise to fix it soon.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Hi again and happy new year! I guess some changes have been done already because in my workout yesterday the behavior was quite different. What happens now is that the line is pretty smooth all the time, which is working pretty good when holding steady power for longer intervals. The problem comes when there are big changes in power (for example start or end of interval) that it takes about 20 seconds to display the real power.\nUser Problem: Takes about 20 seconds to display the real power after big changes.\nAnswer: Yes, it is going a bit slower than I wanted (power changes). We are going to allow turning it off. You can read here but we also need to improve it which we will do soon. We used to have it this way but it seemed like it caused confusion. We will start with on/off for now and then go from there if we need to add it back. Right now it is variable meaning on interval change it is 2 seconds smoothing and then when power stabilizes it is 10 seconds but obviously it\u2019s not perfect.\nSolution: Acknowledgment of the delay in power changes and plans to allow turning off the smoothing.",

If you are doing your \u201cplan\u201d or sequence like this and feeling good and it is just feeling \u201ceasy\u201d then it\u2019s likely your FTP is improving but it also could just be your time to exhaustion (TTE) without an FTP increase\u2026 either way, it sounds like these workouts are causing adaption so continuing to increase them makes total sense. So that increase in difficulty could come in the method of decreasing the Z2, Z3 and increasing the Z4 length like you wanted. He really feels 8 minutes of threshold is the maximum that is needed. So you can alternatively just increase the intensity a bit to like 104% of FTP\u2026 So it could be a mix of either. In this case you could just press + in our app for example. So ultimately I agree with you that we should just add a harder variant of this. Secondly the part I had wrong is their is no reason to switch to another block unless you feel you have stopped improving and feel a bit stuck or are time constrained with some specific workouts that are closer related to a specific goal/event.",

With the synchronization functions to TrainingPeaks and Intervals.cu it has become even better! Perfect for me I\u2019ve been doing a lot of Zone2 the last 9 months, and my aerobic endurance has improved extremely. Right now I\u2019m doing a peak block with a little more intensity to get ready for a few alpine passes in early September. I would like to switch to polarized training after that. I find the suggested VO2max sessions from CJ to be too short in terms of interval length, and too intense. I would like to do longer VO2max/Threshold intervals on the intense days. So for example beginning with 4x4min @105% or max 110%, then slowly increase the interval length to 4x8min or similar. Is there such an option in CJ? Best regards Tom\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nThanks so much. Your training sounds perfect and your VO2max plan sounds very good as well. We have these custom progressions, you may have seen, but we don\u2019t have one like that. We could add that as a new progression but not sure how quickly you need it. I guess hand building this workout sequence would not take much time, create, clone, use our sets and reps, tweak and repeat. My guess is a sequence of 10 could be done in 30 minutes. In CJ we would start at lower level maybe 4X2 and build up but you could just increase intensity slider to get to 4x4 as your starting point.\n\nPost 3 by R2Tom:\nThat would be great to add another progression, and as I wrote, I don\u2018t need it right now, somewhen in fall / winter (in Europe) would be sufficient. Otherwise I will add custom workouts to the calendar, if it\u2018s not implemented then. I have to say, though, that it really would be easier with CJ (and that\u2019s why I like this feature so much!). Adjust workout length, intensity or something like that, and with two clicks it\u2019s synced with the calendar\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nI understand completely. I like this sequence so I will try to get it done.\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nOk, I forgot it is not so easy building a sequence like this I am doing it in code in simple string format which is way faster than our workout editor, not to mention I am pretty good at doing these sequences. I also had Coach Andrea review and did a few revisions until he accepted it and spent like 2 hours. But the good news is this is done. It will be available in the next few weeks. The sequence starts \u201ceasy\u201d but goes to extremely hard as the intervals get longer the % of FTP actually goes down. It goes all the way to 4X8 but Andrea says he has never prescribed a workout this hard to any of his athletes. But I always push it so if someone cranks it to start with intensity 10 and does 16 weeks they can end at a place that is barely or not survivable for most. Really by definition you should not be able to do 1 interval > 6 minutes @ VO2max but since none of this stuff is perfectly accurate it is possible for some crazy guys to do this sequence to the end. You should be happy with this. Below you can see what it looks like.

        "text": "They are very hard on the body. Not just physiologically, but also physically. There are a lot of studies that have proven the effect of shorter intervals. The main benefit of shorter intervals is that you can keep up the intensity higher for that short period of time and therefore do more than during the same time under pressure with longer intervals. I train all my clients with a polarised training. I give them a little bit of freedom so they can also do rides they like. This gives them an optimal trainingload, both physically and mentally. As Alex said, right now I\u2019m on vacation. This gives me more time to do extra training, but since I\u2019m in hte mountains I want to ride the big ones too. So my trainingload is bigger than it should be, but the fun is there and that makes it okee. I wouldn\u2019t do this when I\u2019m home. Than it is back to polarised schedules and a wilde ride accasionally. I hope this gives you some new ideas.

This is the same as Joe Friel would recommend from cycling bible or other sources and the same as Andrea and I believe. The key point relative to your discussion is progressive overload which Dylan mentions multiple times. So the point is all about where do you you start. We suggest you start some where that feels moderate to easy and slowly increase and by the end of a training block should feel moderate to hard. When you start by 2X20 even if it is upper tempo you don\u2019t have far to go or your won\u2019t progress very quickly. If you start with a 2X8 and build to a 2X20 or even a 2X30 then you are likely going to feel fine along your journey. Roberts suggests are always so down to earth and backed with a lot of experience is why I love them",

        "text": "Blog Article: Designing The Perfect Interval Workout Using W'bal\n\n#### Starting with Progressive Overload\n\nAs most of you likely know, one of the key fundamentals of exercise is progressive overload. This means if you want to get stronger you need to go to failure or at least close to failure to tell your body it needs to repair itself and get stronger so next time this same exercise is easy.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0xYyOCvibyEmEczap.jpg)\n\n### How many intervals should I be\u00a0doing?\n\nEveryone knows that they have a limited amount of time, that they can sustain a hard-effort. We can clarify hard-effort as anything above your FTP. But how much time is that exactly? Meaning should I do four 2-minutes intervals @ 120% or maybe they should be 2:15 not 2-minutes. Since each athlete has a unique amount of anaerobic capacity (W\u2019). You should train with custom intervals matched to your personal W\u2019. You can hunt by trial and error, or you can use this cool TrainerDay feature called W\u2019 Balance (W\u2019Bal). This same feature has been in GoldenCheetah for a long time, but we feel we simplified it.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0ysY46bOrDhfas0UX.jpg)\n\n### Finding the perfect interval\u00a0workouts\n\nThis is a fairly deep subject but just starting with the basics is a huge step forward and something that many workout authors overlook. So for this article we are talking about intervals above your FTP. You want to tax your anaerobic system with just the right stimulus.\n\nThe basic idea is when you are above FTP your anaerobic work capacity (AWC or W\u2019) diminishes. Many people also call this \u201cburning matches.\u201d You only have so many matches to burn. Although when you drop below your FTP your W\u2019 recovers, or the match book fills back up, slowly. The great news is we have added W\u2019Bal to our workout creator.\n\n### 5000+ Is Too Many\u00a0Choices\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0WVmL4pI8fTbu_xpU.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0aQCWEwrcemsHW-_X.png)\n\nI would like to point out, I don\u2019t feel a 10-minute warm-up is enough, it should be closer to 20. It just improved the visibility in this example.\n\n### How to use the W\u2019Bal Calculator\n\nTurn on the W\u2019Bal feature. Enter your FTP or if you know it your CP in the CP box. Enter your W\u2019 ([how to calculate](https://trainerday.com/how-to-calculate-your-critical-power-cp-and-w/)) and you are good to go.\n\nThe red line shows you\u2019re predicted remaining energy and you can see at the end of this set of intervals your remaining energy is at the bottom this W\u2019Bal predicts you are completly fatigued at the end of the intervals. Perfect.\n\nMany scientific studies have proven the validity of these formulas.\n\nIn this example on the left, if you have a W\u2019 of 20kJ, and a FTP of 200, with those intervals, you will burn all your matches. The interesting thing is if you had a 300w FTP, you could not complete this workout (read [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|this article]] to find out why). Another benefit is that designing workouts that you know you should be able to finish can help inspire you to push a little farther. If you make this last interval a little farther and you can finish it (i.e. you can go below zero) that frequently means your W\u2019 or possibly FTP is likely a little higher than you thought.",

        "text": "You always want to mix things up. For your body, as wel as for your own interest. I\u2019m specifially talking about he 4x8 intervals. I would start with 4x2 and work your way up to 4x8. Research shows that shorter intervals are way more effective, because the time you need to focus is shorter. Also, from a overload point of view a progressive series of work-outs makes more sense than doing the same work-out over and over again. Research shows that doing the same work-out over and over will make you progress in the first three weeks, than stop and eventually even lose some fitness. Therefore, I always create three week cycles and build cycle by cycle towards a greater fitness and more race specific intevals. Have lots of fun, Coach Robert\n\nPost 11 by PepperTransAm:\nHi Robert, Thanks for the response. And yes, it is a ton of fun. I love working to get in the best shape of my life in my 50s and figuring out the best way to keep improving! However, I am a bit confused. You mention agreeing with Alex completely, but seem to be recommending the intervals, though with a progression rather than repeating the same sets. However, during base season Alex had suggested doing pure Maffetone, which would keep me in Zone 2 every ride and preclude any intervals for at least a while, if not fully until my build phase. Are you suggesting I should start those now but in smaller doses in the beginning with 4x2 progressing towards 4x8 by the time I get to the build, or sticking with the Maffetone now but applying that progression to the build phase? Thanks again, learning a lot here!\n\nPost 12 by Alex:\nI will partially respond here. Robert means once you get to your build period doing 4X8 over and over again does not make sense. I have never heard of any coach recommending this (Dr Seiler is not really a \u201creal\u201d coach, I believe he just likes this and it is simple and produces reasonable results). It goes against training principals like progressive overload and variety for example. But at the same time it can produce reasonable results if you don\u2019t mind suffering a lot. There are physically easier and more efficient ways to do this, but that one is dead simple. Dr Seiler is a scientist that proved something very valuable. Mostly easy and minimal amounts of hard produced better results than consistently moderately hard. He also proved high TSS is not better than lower TSS. Robert and I agree on a lot regarding the base fundamentals of a health first approach to training, his programs look different than Coach Jack or my suggestions but ultimately we think more a like than different.\n\nPost 13 by PepperTransAm:\nGot it. Yeah, the 4x8 intervals do sound simple, but I was never married to them, was an idea from a podcast for a simple base period but I think I\u2019ve moved on from that. My current plan, after the above discussion, is to stick to Maffetone/Zone 2 (using your HR function in the app) during the base period (about 10-12 hours/week for 12 weeks), then I threw on a Polarized Build phase (about 8 weeks) and a Big Days Peak phase (also about 8 weeks) leading up to some 100km-100mi gravel races this summer. Is that a sound plan in your opinion? Appreciate you both.\n\nPost 14 by dthrog00:\n4x8 the way Seiler prescribed them, near max effort ending up probably at 105% of FTP, are going to sting quite a lot. There\u2019s a Coach Jack block that simulates this. It is VO2 Max Long under custom.",

        "text": "don't know how to pronounce it in in Italian but it's Italian that strength training it's low rpm and then a sweet spot or threshold and a long ride and then an extra ride so generally it's 3 workouts a week and each one of these bills this is from 30 TSS 40 TSS then I got a recovery here's my recovery week and a 40 60 and then I'm going 60 so each this is slowly kind of going up and the sweet spot is slowly going up and the long ride is let's say slowly going up so each of them is slowly going up and I did introduce a couple of extras because I didn't want to make the other rides much longer or much longer and so I introduced a couple of days with some extras so that I kind of hit a maximum of close to two hours for a for maybe two hours and 15 minutes or something we'll see how it turns out so then I take this and I say okay now I need to create these workouts I need to create SFR with 30 TSS points with 40 TSS points with 60 so I create four different SF RS for different sweet spots for different long workouts and then my recoveries I've got actually four different I've got a 30 of 50 and 80 and a 100 so also for different recoveries so once I've created those 16 different workouts then I just drag them onto my plan so if I go into my library I've actually already started this let's look at my SFR here's an SF r30 I've created I'll go into edit so it's just got a 45 percent warm-up for ten minutes then a fifty five percent for ten minutes and then we go into a sixty eight percent for reps at sixty eight percent at this you know loke very low cadence and with a one minute 45 percent rest that's it normal cadence and then then I cool down I called down slightly easier because this is a zone to even I would say a low zone two or fairly low zone to workout even though the locatin sis is some intensity I would say that your your warrior cool-down could be slightly shorter than you know it doesn't need to be a full 20 minutes but again if you've got an extra five minutes you could make it an hour and you're not gonna hurt anything but you know it would be I'll probably always recommend it to do longer warm-ups and cooldowns if you've got the time anyway so but I'm just are getting thirty stress and so it's okay maybe I'll change this actually I like that better I would actually go to 65% there that's actually better it's one hour and then we'll go ahead and save that so I've got a SFR 30 I'll save it I would actually take my description and place it in here I would take that one actually take these three I'm gonna improve this this but I would say 45 45 to 55 this is kind of for outdoors if you're going outdoors you would just do it 20 minutes from 40 to 55 cooldown would be from 55 to 45 so this is a good outdoor description if you're writing outdoors okay so there I've got my outdoor description and now when I want to create my next one I just come in real quick and I just go to copy work out and I would just increase it a bit and so that might be might keep everything the same but do five reps maybe make this five minutes five reps and maybe we'll do 70% this time five reps and 70% we're still it let's see here oh maybe we'll do you know that's okay we could do our rest percentage at 50 we're now at 35 that's probably good so it's just I'm basically just creating a progression on you can't see the bottom down here I'm just creating a progression that I've got one extra rep I've got five percent extra in my FTP still a very let's say reasonable stress level so so each time each each week I just want to you know increase this increase everything a little bit not too much but I ultimately trying to get my target up to 40 so I probably want to go 10 minutes at 55 there's an hour and five minutes and let's see what's another good one to do it probably could do 60% here I probably could do a 60% and a 60% it probably doesn't",

        "text": "For now I will stick with threshold and Vo2max tue/thur combined with long Z2 at the weekend which is probably close to what Dr Seiler advocates. This morning was threshold #8 and it felt really good during and afterwards so will continue and keep close attention on sensations. The ability to customise plans etc is streets ahead of trainer road so great job there.\n\nPost 12 by Alex:\nThanks so much. Yes as you say, actually as you get stronger zone 2 power is not easy. As your aerobic fitness improves significantly even the top of zone 2 heart rate is not so easy. Dr Maffetone and the 7X iornman winner Mark Allen pointed out that when he got to peak fat / aerobic adaption he was doing zone 2 HR intervals as they were hard and he did not feel like keeping in zone 2 non-stop. Andrea points out for pros zone 2 is real work. It\u2019s important to clarify that Dr. Seiler\u2019s definition of easy is below AeT (aerobic threshold), determinine your AeT base on HR is the key point. For a lot of people that is closer to 65% of power but might even be 60%. That will improve over time as you get more and more aerobic / fat adapted. If you eat pre-meal carbs that will shoot your HR up and start buring glycogen immediately so that you end up training at a lower power intensity. If you can burn mostly fat then your HR stays lower, power goes up and it gets much harder.\n\nPost 13 by Alex:\nA post was split to a new message: Allow searching CJ workouts from my plan\n\nPost 14 by arthurdaly:\nAlex: So I did not explain the problem of why we only allow #10 now. We allow up to 16 week blocks, so that is up to #26. Hi Alex. Can I just check re the maximum workout level of #26. When I select a 4 month block starting with #10 in week 1, the maximum is #21 in week 15. This is because there is a recovery week in each month. Is there an option I am missing when creating the plan? Thanks.\n\nPost 15 by Alex:\nOh you are right there is no way to get above level 21. I just checked and I have sequences up to 24 but since you can\u2019t get there they are un-necessary This is levels #22-24. I assume you mean our threshold progressions not threshold blocks 2 X (3m@70% + 6m@82% + 6m@102% + 5m@40%) 2 X (3m@70% + 6m@83% + 6m@103% + 5m@40%) 2 X (3m@70% + 6m@84% + 6m@104% + 5m@40%)",

This way the smar trainer will report power/speed/candence and the garmin device (EDGE/FENIX\u2026) will not try to controlling it using ANT or BLE\u2026 I prefer this method to have the GARMIN controlling the smart trainer, and this is because TrainerDay running on my iphone is much more stable and friendly to use\n\nPost 11 by Sport_IT_Diederik:\nI\u2019m just uploading the workout manually. Yes, I\u2019m missing some stuff in Garmin. But Garmin (and Strava) don\u2019t understand indoor workouts properly anyhow.

Ryan Thomas explains the concept of \u2018constant pressure\u2019 indoors vs outdoors. Provided you don\u2019t freewheel indoors, it\u2019s very hard to compare indoor workloads to outdoors workloads anyway.

It costs $4 a year. If you search online, you\u2019ll find that Garmin does occasionally break this RunGap functionality, but once it\u2019s reported to RunGap, they have been able to fix it within a few days. Both TrainerDay and RunGap provide excellent and fast support. (Thanks to Alex for helping me find this solution!)",

I never heard about alpha1 (incredibile how many thigs there are out there ahah). Do you have any articles or something to suggest to read? Is there any application to be installed on the garmin? Thank you\n\nPost 13 by dduffey:\nOn your garmin watch, go into the \u201csensors & accessories\u201d menu, you will see your sensors. You can click on one of your connected sensors (like your Polar) and then \u201cAbout\u201d, it will list \u201cTech: BLE | ANT+\u201d. Note that the \u201cAbout\u201d sub menu only works if the sensors is currently connected. That will let you know if it is connected via BLE or ANT+. For the Polar, you can connect to both at the same time from the watch, therefore I added them both as sensors and appended \u201c-a\u201d for ant and \u201c-b\u201d for BLE on the sensor name, I then turn \u201coff\u201d the \u201c-a\u201d sensor so it doesn\u2019t auto connect and only the BLE sensor connects. If you find it\u2019s connected via ANT+, just turn it \u201coff\u201d in the watch and then do a \u201cAdd New\u201d under sensors. Sometimes after it searches there is another submenu item like \u201cSearch Bluetooth\u201d as well. This I think happens if it finds ANT+ devices first, you need to tell the watch to keep searching for BLE as well. Then for other sensors (like cadence) I tend to use ANT+ for garmin, leaving the BLE for trainerday. I also found I can add my smart trainer to my garmin via ANT+ to capture power data, etc., and as BLE to TD (to control the power). Just make sure you\u2019re only running a workout on TD to avoid conflicts and then use the garmin just for recording (the garmin will not control the smart trainer via ANT+ if you don\u2019t run a workout and just use it for recording). Here is the alphahrv app: Connect IQ Store | Free Watch Faces and Apps | Garmin I honestly don\u2019t have enough data or types of rides yet to say if it has value or not. The author of that app is active on intervals.icu, so if you search that forum for \u201calphahrv\u201d and \u201crr/a1\u201d you\u2019ll find a lot of discussion and links to other articles.\n\nPost 14 by Mark9:\nThank you very much for the info.

If you add fr or free-ride to the interval type in our editor you will get Open-Ended workouts on your Garmin device. You must still include an amount of time for this. Generally I would put a time similar to what you think you might do.\n\nYou can push to Garmin or push to TrainingPeaks and this open-ended feature will work. One secret trick is if you put 60% in the target FTP% then it will actually show a target of 40\u2013100% on your Garmin meaning it really is a free ride.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0zawJbn2W3DGKdZy4.png)\n\n### Zwift\u200a\u2014\u200aFree\u00a0Ride\n\nAlthough Free-Ride and open ended are different concepts, I would argue the training focus might be similar. Meaning it\u2019s a bit unstructured. This is why we are calling them the same thing. Type \u201cfr\u201d or \u201cfree-ride\u201d in the type box. So a free-ride section on Zwift means that it goes into resistance or slope mode so you must change your gears to set the appropriate power. The only way to use this feature is in the ZWO file download. TrainingPeaks does not support this for example.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0bKgaLAlGlVoznhFA.png)",

Why?\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nOur titles are actually based on the long term focus/goal of the workout rather than the specific time in zone for any individual workout. This one specifically is recommend for outdoor when possible. Outdoor most people won\u2019t do a 3 hour zone 1 workout so it naturally turns into zone2/3\u2026 Just ideally starting easier and slowly getting a bit faster by the end of the block. Indoor is harder on your body for long duration efforts like this. Also this workout starts at lower intensity and slowly build it up so at the end of 12 weeks or so it should be mostly z2/z3 by the end. If you are using our training app and want to start with z2/z3 you can and just in the beginning press the up arrow at the bottom to get it to the right level. Finally many people are obsessed with proper TSS management and so slightly adjusting intensity in addition to duration of this type of effort is the best way for us to align with peoples expectations.",

Best t\n\nPost 13 by yokuha:\nAlex: Yes, I don\u2019t like this aspect of the way every one does eFTP, I keep wanting to build something different (I tried once and failed\u2026). What do you refer to with \u201ethe way\u201c? Is it the single-ride eFTP? This is not the actual eFTP prediction if I.icu, I am sure you know. There is a chart in the fitness chart that shows I.icu\u2018s analysis of the whole training history, including increases from max. efforts and decrease over time\u2026 It still is only reasonable if one has repeated max efforts as time goes by. (Similar discussion for, e.g., TP and Xert left out;-). Major issue with this is that it uses any relevant best effort, and for short ones that. Igor contain significant anaerobic contributions if you just do 5 min allout after warmup\u2026 etc. I.icu also has the FTP/CP/W\u2018 calculator on the power page, which is a better approach because it uses (clearly documented) approaches to calculate these numbers and you can even compare the different implemented formulas, incl. multi-point calculations\u2026 Personally, I still adjust (increase/decrease) my FTP for training purposes based on RPE and EF of intervals I do regularly (4 x4\u2019 120 % or 2 x 20\u201330\u2019 90 % are good measures for me), esp. during race season. This is avoiding further load from tests, as brought up by @Robert_UCL\n\nPost 14 by Alex:\nYes, I am pretty sure intervals is also based on max efforts so if you are doing base training only or zone 2 it will go down when in reality your actually two hour aerobic performance might even be improving and for most of us 2 hour aerobic performance is more important than our 20 minute test time. So what happens is people get attached to this FTP calculation and their training can be dictated by their eFTP\u2026 or they pick a training plan that improves this estimate. For some riders this can be ok, but for many they would be better off just ignoring FTP all together other than a rough estimate of training intensities. I am just making up this theory now, but I would say eFTP or FTP improvements are most critical during a peak period of training\u2026 I have not thought that well through but it sounds right\n\nPost 15 by yokuha:\nAlex: I am pretty sure intervals is also based on max efforts Well, kind of \u2013 sure. As mentioned, you can choose different models for CP/FTP calculation on the Power page of i.icu. For instance, you could choose Morton\u2019s 3-parameter model: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139608964484\n\nPost 16 by Alex:\nSure I use W\u2019 CP calculations a lot but you still need max efforts and if you don\u2019t do max efforts in longer durations it can cause issues that increases in short durations can actually lower your estimated critical power \u201cFTP.\u201d",

It\u2019s -15C outside with several cm of snow so it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019ll be biking outdoors in the foreseeable future. Personally, I find I can\u2019t do more than an hour of indoor riding at a time. Should I spread out my endurance time across several days, (add Friday and Monday) or does it make more sense to break it up into several sessions on Sunday?\nContext: User is facing extreme weather conditions preventing outdoor rides.\nUser Problem: Inability to ride outdoors due to weather and difficulty with long indoor sessions.\nAnswer: 100% agreed. My biomechanics coach expert says no more than 90 minutes indoors. Not enough movement/variation. Easy for him to say he lives in Italy I need to ask him what he suggests as I don\u2019t know the best answer here. I think he will just say keep it at 90 and maybe mix in other aerobic activities but let me confirm. He tends to be a perfectionist in this regard and focused on minimizing micro-damage, so personally I think there can be more flexibility but everything should be done to minimize this micro-damage occurred from too much time on a static machine.\nSolution: Keep indoor rides to a maximum of 90 minutes and consider mixing in other aerobic activities.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thanks all for the forum topic and discussion. I\u2019m doing a CJ plan, 5 days a week, with the Z2/Z3 free-ride outside scheduled on the weekend. This week calls for 3 hours. I live in Canada and certainly with the snow and cold, all rides are on the trainer. I did a 2.5 hr ride last week and found that very tough - mentally, even with Netflix, and physically, and hadn\u2019t thought of taking a few minutes break or two, excellent ideas. So, if I\u2019m reading correctly, suggestion to maintain the integrity of the training plan could be to break up the ride into two 90min blocks on the same day. My question is, would I just pause the workout (in the app) and restart when I hop back on later that same day? Or would the ride timeout after a certain time has elapsed? I suppose I could try and find out but thought I\u2019d ask the forum. Thanks.\nContext: User is following a training plan and struggling with long indoor rides.\nUser Problem: Concern about how to manage long indoor rides and maintain training integrity.\nAnswer: Yes just do 2 shorter sessions in whatever fashion you want as long as max is 90 minutes. If your long ride is long enough you could do 3-sessions. Even 3 60-minute sessions would be fine. Since Jack is not monitoring your compliance to the plan it does not matter how you save the workout. If you are using our app you could just do the same workout two times (but cut each one in 1/2) and it will look reasonable in your history. But if you like to see one big workout in strava or your history then you could just stop pedalling or pause it and come back and do it again. Even if you kill the app or restart your phone it will remember where you were (although I would not do that to be extra safe :)). If you are in the middle of the workout you could switch to resistance or slope mode for your cool down or for example you can just go to the library tab free workouts and grab the warmup and use it as a cool down.\nSolution: You can break up the ride into shorter sessions and the app will remember your progress.",

I am starting base training for a difficult granfondo l\u2019\u00e9tape, with about 4000 m D+) next July. I\u2019m a pretty experienced (but very average recreational) cyclist, but first time trying structured training. I\u2019m 62 years old. My problem is I\u2019m obliged to spend 7 to 10 hours a week commuting. About 60 km per day, 3 to 4 days a week. Each commute with about a 200 m climb at the end. Too much traffic, etc for a structured workout, and the climbing part makes it practically impossible to stay in zone 2. I\u2019ve thought of various strategies for dealing with this. Wondering if anyone has any thoughts. These pertain to winter base period. Just ride as slow as possible on the climbs, even if it entails some zone 3 and 4. Do the climbs at zone 4 and 5, avoiding zone 3. Do the climbs in too large gearing, for a sort of weight-lifting type activity. Don\u2019t worry about numbers, just avoid leg burn, and ride such that recovery each day is no problem. Any thoughts?\nContext: Starting base training for a granfondo while commuting a lot.\nUser Problem: Difficulty in maintaining zone 2 during commutes due to climbing and traffic.\nAnswer: 100% full agreement with R2Tom here. You don\u2019t need structured workouts. Maybe some variety like SFR (very low RPM) and maybe benefiting the most from a weekly long ride and as he suggested a periodic high intensity. That could just be on one of your commutes do max efforts for 3 4 times for 1 minute\u2026\nSolution: Incorporate variety and periodic high intensity efforts.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: So for all those suggesting something like riding hard on one commute a week, would that include the base period, or is it better left for later?\nContext: Seeking clarification on training during the base period.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about incorporating hard efforts during the base training phase.\nAnswer: I would closely compare average power to average HR for a specific segment of your ride about 5 to 10 minutes long. If would suggest you start with no hard days per week and see if you are making progress. Also ideally ride fasted to work if possible, or low carb breakfast long before the commute and start with gradual warmup. In this case you should definitely see progress. Some people 1 day per week hard would be not impact their Z2 progress and some people it would. Probably depends on how much stress you have and how well you sleep.\nSolution: Start with no hard days per week and monitor progress.",

If you use a music player of some sort and press back it goes to the beginning of the song again, but if you press it quickly again then it goes to the previous song start. This is essentially a double click to get an \u201cinterval set.\u201d The problem is when you press next twice, the intervals are essentially deleted so back would just repeat what you previously did not what you removed unless we do some magic that makes it work like undo for a period of time but I think that makes it even more confusing. A temporary undo button would be safer. Navigating to a specifc point is a bit confusing too. Meaning after you navigate backwards then you don\u2019t want one power reading going over the top of the other one.

But again my sense for coding made a turn 20 years ago. I had sometimes the problem that I double-tapped the screen by mistake and the intervall was \u201cgone\u201d. What about gestures? Two fingers swipe left backward and the same to the right. Yes it could confuse users or it could end as a hidden feature, but it could also be a solution.\n\nPost 8 by Alex:\nYes, lombo, you are right \u201cwe can remember everything.\u201d One of our testers also wants a gesture or a longer hold required for next making it more difficult to click twice on accient. My current thinking is that to temporarily show an UNDO button when you click next, and you can undo multiple times if you click multiple times. I am aware it is totally frustrating to \u201cdelete\u201d an important interval.\n\nPost 9 by Lombo:\nSounds good, I\u2019m looking forward to that feature. The gesture was just an idea, you know the details and also the complaints if something does not work\n\nPost 10 by Alex:\nGesture is not bad idea\u2026 I just prefer to make it more obvious so I don\u2019t have to keep answering the same questions over and over. I prefer to spend my time and love to answer new questions over and over\n\nPost 11 by laserpez:\nSorry, has this feature ben implemented?\n\nPost 12 by Alex:\nYes, but you have to think about it differently Meaning rather than move to previous, it\u2019s duplicate last interval, you can see more here. [COMPLETED] - Repeat Interval Feature New Features Ok everyone here that wanted to old single press extend feature it is fully back but more flexible version. By default now it will be \u201cextend current interval\u201d just like it was before and it shows a little lock symbol indicating that. And just like before a long hold can modify the amount of time each click does. Below shows exactly this.",

The problem with the implementation of \u201cstop\u201d button is that it is final - once \u201cStop\u201d is pressed there is no way to resume a workout - your options are only to discard a workout or save it. I propose to change the implementation of stop/pause to have just one button instead of two: pressing on stop once should act as pause (resume button should show up) and pressing the stop button for the second time is the actual stop and that should offer save and discard. But even if my proposal is not good for some reason I still would recommend some solution to safeguard against mistaken pressing on \u201cstop\u201d without a way to revert\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nThis is a good suggestion. It used to be like this and it changed and I don\u2019t know why or when.

While doing a exersize with the TrainerDay on a 6\" screen, it is sometimes hard to put the fingers on the right button. It happend that I pressed the forward button instead of erg/slope. Same request for the up and down buttons at the bottom of the screen. I wouldn\u2019t mind if the window with the graph would be a bit less tall.\nContext: Using TrainerDay on a small screen\nUser Problem: Difficulty in pressing the right buttons during workouts\nAnswer: Ok yes, it\u2019s hard because some devices are small and things barely fit, but for larger devices we could see if we could add a bit more room. Skipping forward is a problem I would love to have a better solution too. People have a drop of sweat click the skip button and that is also a problem.\nSolution: Consider adding more room for larger devices\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Suggested solution: is it possible to program in the workout file one or more \u2018milestone-like\u2019 time points (there probably is a better name, perhaps FF-point). When pushing the forward button, the workout proceeds to the next FF-point. Would be nice if these time points are visible in the graph and description of the workout. This makes it possible to skip a part of a workout, like when the interval set is too heavy, or to skip a complete set of intervals.\nContext: Proposing a feature to improve workout navigation\nUser Problem: Difficulty in skipping intervals during workouts\nAnswer: You mean because now you have to press skip a bunch of times to get past a few intervals? The problem is most people would rarely if ever program this into their workout and you would never know if someone wants to just skip forward to next interval or skip to FF point. I guess we could have a HOLD skip to move it to FF point but again I think it would it would be such a small number of users used this. Maybe if we built it into our CJ plans. It\u2019s a good idea. I agree with the concept but what I find is lots of my 'good ideas' never get used.\nSolution: Consider a HOLD skip to move to FF point\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Ok. Get it. BTW. Do you know how many user use a feature?\nContext: Inquiring about feature usage statistics\nUser Problem: Curiosity about feature popularity\nAnswer: Many specific features we track yes but not all. I don\u2019t track skip but just from talking to people a lot use it.\nSolution: Tracks many features but not skip",

So I\u2019m doing a hard workout and i need to pause for some reason, to answer the phone or because i want to puke because of acid build up, i hit pause and immediately the power setting is set to something low so that i can keep pedaling while finishing the phonecall or puke and continue my workout.\nUser Problem: Difficulty in maintaining power level when pausing during a workout.\nAnswer: Hi, there are multiple ways to do this but we have no way to do this in 1 click. The simplest is just to press slope mode and possibly shift gears or press + - to get to the intensity level you want. Now if you want to resume from where you were at you would need to just keep pedalling at low intensity, and reselect the same workout and it would merge them together and press skip a few times to get back to where you were at and press ERG again. Now this probably requires 5-10 clicks. We want to add the ability to insert a segment or interval set which would be closer to what you want and could probably do this in a couple clicks with less brain power required.\nSolution: Press slope mode and adjust intensity manually; future feature to insert segments.",

The interesting thing is if you had a 300w FTP, you could not complete this workout (read [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|this article]] to find out why). Another benefit is that designing workouts that you know you should be able to finish can help inspire you to push a little farther. If you make this last interval a little farther and you can finish it (i.e. you can go below zero) that frequently means your W\u2019 or possibly FTP is likely a little higher than you thought.\n\n[View My Example W\u2019bal Workout](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/45588/copy)\n\n### Watch a 6-minute video below showing you how W\u2019Bal works in TrainerDay\n\n[https://youtu.be/rrIc7LZ8Cjk](https://youtu.be/rrIc7LZ8Cjk)\n\n### Additional Reading\n\nHere is a good article describing the value of W\u2019 and W\u2019Bal\n\n[https://pezcyclingnews.com/toolbox/the-anaerobic-w/](https://pezcyclingnews.com/toolbox/the-anaerobic-w/)\n\nThe below link is deep but if you really want to understand, Mark from GoldenCheetah knows the ins and outs\n\n[http://markliversedge.blogspot.com/2014/07/wbal-its-implementation-and-optimisation.html](http://markliversedge.blogspot.com/2014/07/wbal-its-implementation-and-optimisation.html)\n\nThis video from Mark is a good balance between deep and useful\n\n[https://vimeo.com/100599100](https://vimeo.com/100599100)\n\nMark has done lots of writing and videos about W\u2019 and W\u2019Bal that are worth learning more about.

I typically use the wahoo fitness app for my outdoor bike rides, and for all my gym activities. Now this auto syncs in Strava, TP and intervls.ICU, so far so good. But if I do a workot with TD, I can\u2019t import or sync it to wahoo calendar systm, even if this is synced to tp, strava, ICU. How can I import the activity performed and recorded with TD into the Wahoo diary?\nContext: New user of TrainerDay looking for integration help.\nUser Problem: Cannot sync TD workouts to Wahoo calendar.\nAnswer: Thank you so much!!! Very strange it should automatically show up from Strava. Disconnect and reconnect to Strava might solve your problem. If not let me know.\nSolution: Disconnect and reconnect to Strava.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Hi Alex, I tried to disconnect strava and reconnect it from both the site and the app, but nothing to do, it still doesn\u2019t synchronize my TD activity on the Wahoo System Please, help me\nContext: Follow-up after initial troubleshooting.\nUser Problem: Still cannot sync TD activity to Wahoo.\nAnswer: Can you s me me link to your ride in strava?\nSolution: Request for Strava ride link.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Dear Alex, more I study TD the more I am surprised.

I ask you how can I use td to record a free and unstructured workout outdoor? I use only iPhone on my bike.\nContext: User expressing surprise and seeking guidance on outdoor workouts.\nUser Problem: Need guidance on recording unstructured outdoor workouts.\nAnswer: Hi, we are actually going to remove this outdoor training mode from our app as almost no one is using it.

        "text": "Blog Article: FTP Measures Aerobic - What About Anaerobic?\n\n#### Need some extra\u00a0power?\n\nIn cycling, aerobic power, measured by FTP, is not optional, it\u2019s what gets you in the game. But if you want to excel in MTB, cyclo-cross, or find yourself periodically get dropped in sprints with your buddies, you might need to build your anaerobic power.\n\nFTP, i.e. Functional Threshold Power, has become the most common term in performance cycling. It is great to have a single term to represent your cycling fitness level. It\u2019s very useful that it allows **AEROBIC** training to be easily and even automatically adjusted to the right intensity.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0XOzrJ9RinsaYnqv8.png)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0RRh402_XqybSuGBV.png)\n\n### The other energy system\u200a\u2014\u200aAnaerobic\n\nA deeper understanding of your fitness requires looking at both your aerobic and anaerobic abilities. If you take a ramp test, for example, your anaerobic power might noticeably affect your test, throwing off your FTP a little.\n\nDiscussing and thinking about anaerobic capacity seems to be scary for many cyclists, not the anaerobic training itself, but measuring anaerobic seems to be the scary part.\n\nMeasuring your anaerobic can be as simple as measuring your FTP and provide valuable insight and give you motivation when your FTP has flatlined.\n\n### Burning Matches\n\nCyclists like to call it burning matches, you only have so many to burn before your energy level crashes. The number of matches you have is your Anaerobic Work Capacity (AWC or W\u2019) We will use the term W\u2019 (pronounced W-Prime).\n\nMonitoring your personal W\u2019 will give you insight to your Anaerobic Work Capacity. Weight lifting is anaerobic and both it and anaerobic cycling follow similar principals. Imagine going to the gym, lifting weights but not tracking or even measuring your progress. Just grab a random set of weights and lift them a random number of times. Similar to lifting weights, building your W\u2019 requires training close to or to failure. Doing the correct amount of exercise will provide more predictable results, allowing your body to repair and build itself. We could all use a few more matches.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0TOqNMHh15K4t9Q0D.png)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0bN-mxf7XLySPsZrM.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0bSajC43XgSgjMdbg.jpg)\n\n### Light bulbs and your Electricity bill\n\nWe have been comfortable using watts for lightbulbs and hair-dryers for a long time, and with the popularity of power meters we are comfortable using watts on our bikes. The watts measurement is instantaneous, it has no time. You can say \u201cwatts for 10-seconds\u201d but watts themselves have no time. So when talking about energy, we need to include time. This unit of measurement is kilojoules (kJ). A joule is 1-watt for 1-second. Kilojoules are on your electricity bill. You measure your W\u2019 in kilojoules. You likely have a W\u2019 between 5\u201340kJ. That is a fixed number of watts for a fixed amount of time.\n\n### W\u2019s amazing\u00a0cousin\n\nSo one of the incredible benefits of knowing your W\u2019 along with your FTP is with our new feature in our workout creator, you can find or design intervals that precisely fit your fitness profile.\n\nFor example, you are doing 2-minute VO2Max intervals. How long should the rests be? And should the intervals be at 120% or 125%? Welcome to W\u2019 Balance (W\u2019Bal) this is W\u2019s perfect cousin. Scientific studies have show that W\u2019Bal can accurately predict when you will hit failure. It\u2019s sounds scary, but it is surprisingly simple. We will explain how it works in part #3 of this series.\n\n!",

        "text": "All training increases your VO2max as it is primarily a function of aerobic improvement and running/cycling/swimming economy. So not sure how good of base you have now but think in terms of base, build, peak. Base you could spend 6-months doing purely low intensity making sure your body is very well recovered and very prepared for 6 months of increasingly harder and harder efforts. Totally with you on this. Elite athletes doing the very hard Vo2 sessions on regular schedule, are those who have build a large base over several years. And they\u2019re not doing them year round. They do those hard sessions in the peak phase and can sustain them thanks to their large base fitness. Remember that Seiler nuanced the meaning of \u2018hard sessions\u2019 and is no longer advocating only LIT and HIIT. That was modified to LIT for anything under LT1 and \u2018hard\u2019 for anything above that. And still only 1 out of 5 sessions goes into that bucket of \u2018hard\u2019. I advocated before that even a session around LT1, can be a hard session, if you make it long enough. As you say, all training improves VO2max, but enough time in lower intensity, moves the whole curve up, while short hard efforts (HIIT) mainly improve the shorter duration part of the curve and do very little for the longer duration. And that\u2019s why I said to get in as much time as possible while mixing it up with higher intensity if less then 90 min of time is available. The mix of that will work the whole curve up while avoiding injury and high fatigue. If you have the time to ride 3+ hours, do it and keep effort low enough to properly recover for your next session. If you find yourself with 4 hours of available time but your legs are to heavy to do them (because of a too long and heavy session the day before), you will gain less.\n\nPost 10 by dthrog00:\nI mistyped 40 km time trial not minutes.

        "text": "Increase Aerobic Power: VO2 max workouts increase the power and speed you can maintain aerobically. This is particularly beneficial for endurance sports, as it allows for higher sustained speeds. Enhance Recovery Ability: Regularly performing high-intensity workouts can improve your body\u2019s ability to recover between efforts. This is due to improved blood flow and increased efficiency in clearing metabolic byproducts from the muscles. Boost Overall Performance: By improving aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, and recovery, VO2 max workouts contribute to overall athletic performance. This is particularly important in sports that require sustained efforts, such as cycling, running, and rowing. Typical VO2 Max Workouts VO2 max workouts generally involve high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which includes: Intervals: Short bursts of high-intensity exercise (e.g., 3-5 minutes) at or near your VO2 max, followed by rest or low-intensity periods. Tabata Intervals: Very short, extremely high-intensity intervals (20 seconds on, 10 seconds off) repeated multiple times. Hill Repeats: Running or cycling up a hill at high intensity, then recovering on the way down or on flat ground. Pyramids: Gradually increasing the duration of high-intensity intervals, followed by decreasing them in a pyramid-like structure. Implementation Tips Progress Gradually: Start with shorter, less intense intervals and gradually increase the duration and intensity as your fitness improves. Monitor Intensity: Use heart rate monitors, power meters, or perceived exertion scales to ensure you are working at the correct intensity. Rest and Recovery: Allow adequate recovery between intervals and ensure proper rest days between VO2 max workouts to prevent overtraining. Periodization: Incorporate VO2 max workouts into your training plan strategically, usually during the build phase leading up to key events or races. In summary, VO2 max workouts are a critical component of a well-rounded training program aimed at enhancing aerobic capacity, improving cardiovascular efficiency, and boosting overall athletic performance.\n\nPost 3 by Alex:\n@Robert_UCL Robert, what do you think? I think your answer is likely even better than mine, or at least can add value for sure.\n\nPost 4 by Robert_UCL:\nHi Leigh, Coach Robert here. What you are describing is that you see your heart rate increasing during a 30/15 workout. That is entirely normal. This is a very hard workout to do and heart rate is not the best way to monitor this. It takes te body some time to respond. Around 30-60 seconds. So when your first 30 sec are over your heart rate will still be rising. But then you take a 15 sec rest. That first rest is just enough to stop the increase and, if you\u2019re in really good shape, might even show a slow decrease. During the first set the body will fatigue and you will be short on oxygen. After a couple of reps the body realizes that this situation is not going to get better and oxygen demand stays high. Therefore the heart will elevate slightly during the set. The next set you already start with some fatigue. That is why the heart rate will increase even more. In general, it will take the body around 3 minutes to reach a steady state. Provided that the effort stays the same. Since the rest is so short, the level of effort stays fairly simular. However, it is so high that the body builds up oxygen deprivation, free radicals, lactate, and ions. The pain you feel in the legs is not lactate. It is H-ions. We used to believe that it was lactate, but actually, lactate is a byproduct that serves as an energy provider at lower intensities. So, with this in mind, what should you do? My first advice is to do this workout as it is. Don\u2019t go harder in earlier reps and don\u2019t go easier in later reps. If you go harder you will burn out to soon. You need those \u201ceasier\u201d reps to get to the end. Same as you need the intensity at the end to make the difference. Follow this routine for 4 weeks, than move on to a different workout.",

        "text": "Post 5 by MedTechCD:\nIf it is too hard, and it probably will be if your FTP is correct, allow the power to drop somewhat. The important thing for VO2max workouts is that your HR stays high. And that\u2019s also why they are so damned hard\u2026 I personally don\u2019t do that kind of work anymore, I find it to demanding at 59 y old. My hardest workouts are Over-Unders. But during spirited group rides, I every now and then find myself at those high breathing frequencies and almost maxed out HR. It\u2019s a bit easier to find the motivation in those conditions\n\nPost 6 by MedTechCD:\nExcellent and entertaining video!\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nI am 57 and 100% with you there, these super hard workouts are best left for the kids like @Bad_Santa My sprints are all when following my twin 8-year olds up MTB hills.\n\nPost 8 by app4g:\nMedTechCD: But during spirited group rides, I every now and then find myself at those high breathing frequencies and almost maxed out HR. It\u2019s a bit easier to find the motivation in those conditions exactly this\u2026 I find myself no longer too interested (translation - indoor suffering allergic) in these VO2 styled workouts anymore. Leaving all the huffing and puffing during outdoor rides at specific KOM or climb sessions w/ the gang. It\u2019s very easy to go down deep during these rides. WPrime going down nearly 25mins of pushing @ average 105% FTP note: after getting covid, I can\u2019t get / hit my prev max HR before I give up.\n\nPost 9 by Bad_Santa:\nAlex: these super hard workouts are best left for the kids like @Bad_Santa I\u2019m pretty much close to you Alex, I\u2019m 57 this year Alex: I really think when doing workouts > threshold it\u2019s important to implement some RPE in that in the sense, just scale back a little if it is too much. My beliefs are in this video excellent video, I have to agree I have become a slave of metrics over the years, it\u2019s always like \u201coh man, you are 3W below the target, push it, crank those pedals man!!!\u201d. Yep, it\u2019s a psychological condition. Once you get high in FTP it becomes so valueable bc of the time you spent on it that you cannot agree it goes down and you are not that fast anymore\u2026 I\u2019m on this plan at the moment, week 6 currently. I usually modify/simplify it in TP adding Z2 interval to match the route so it looks usually like MS + ~30 min of Z2. Yesterday I made VO2 max crunched #7 and despite of the fact I have modifieid it extending recoveries up to 3 min and adding longer recovery after 3rd interval, I blew up on the last interval. Here\u2019s the workout data I will look into CP and W\u2019, this is very interesting idea indeed to understand if you are capable of doing it till the end. Could you pls share some explanation of how to understand this red line? UPD: link is given will look deeper into it and revert.\n\nPost 10 by Alex:\nOk so you are just a bad ass So if you have more of time trial physiology vs sprinter then it would be much harder for you then someone with a sprinter profile. Search our blog, I have about 3 articles explaining how W\u2019 works. CP is generally your best 20 minutes, or 1.05 X FTP. Here is one example article but others explain it a bit better. I need to do a video on this. AWC and W\u2019 are the same thing. https://blog.trainerday.com/how-to-determine-your-w-missing-calculator-17967294a1e4 Generally as the red line gets closer to the bottom it gets very hard. The red line is W\u2019Bal meaning the balance of what is left (theoretically) in your gas AWC or W\u2019 tank.",

        "text": "Since the rest is so short, the level of effort stays fairly simular. However, it is so high that the body builds up oxygen deprivation, free radicals, lactate, and ions. The pain you feel in the legs is not lactate. It is H-ions. We used to believe that it was lactate, but actually, lactate is a byproduct that serves as an energy provider at lower intensities. So, with this in mind, what should you do? My first advice is to do this workout as it is. Don\u2019t go harder in earlier reps and don\u2019t go easier in later reps. If you go harder you will burn out to soon. You need those \u201ceasier\u201d reps to get to the end. Same as you need the intensity at the end to make the difference. Follow this routine for 4 weeks, than move on to a different workout. There are many different VO2 max workouts. Al lot of them have different training goals. For the 30/15\u2019s the goal is to build up lactate. The rest is to short to let the body recover. That is different from 1 minute zone 5 followed by 1 minute of rest. In that workout the aim will be to let you recover just enough before your next effort. In the end you have to look at what you need in a race. If you\u2019re riding gran fondo\u2019s for fun there is not really a difference. These workouts will build you more power. If you do short mtb races, you will do short climbs and you want to focus on 1-2 minutes of vo2 power. If you do road races you might want to get ahead of the peloton and do 4-5 minutes of vo2 power. For short intervals guiding with a powermeter works better than heart rate. These intervals are great, but don\u2019t forget you don\u2019t have to bury yourself to do a great workout. Have lots of fun.\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nWay better than my answer",

        "text": "Most of his books have the same core information. You can just search Maffetone 180 or ask chatGPT to understand his test.\n\nPost 9 by MedTechCD:\nRobert_UCL: However, if your Threshold is already 146, you have a good aerobic base. Keep that up. I was going to say the exact same thing. If the lab test was done correctly and the measuring devices were calibrated, the test results should be trusted. VT1 sits at an RER of ~0.80 and VT2 at RER=1. And RER (respiratory exchange rate = respiratory quotient = VCO2/VO2) is much more reliable then lactate testing (if the MET cart is functioning correctly). But I am surprised that an LT1 at 146 comes out with a HRmax at 184. Or is this 184, the max during the test and not your true max HR? Elite riders can have a VT1 that is very close to VT2 (only about 10-15bpm separate), but that is the result of many years of consistent training and a volume that you can only get to if you are a pro. If you are in that case, training at VT1 is clearly hard work. Your cardiovascular system has been trained to achieve that result, but the strain on the muscle system is high at such an output. If you want AeT efficiency, and decoupling calculated for you, use Intervals.icu. It has those parameters by default analysed. The Power/HR quotient is something you can use for the entire aerobic zone as a \u2018sub-max\u2019 test. It allows to follow up progress without doing an all out FTP test. Check decoupling for the duration of the events you\u2019re targeting. If you have significant decoupling after 2 hours, you\u2019re not ready to go ride a Grand Fondo of 5-6 hours. Check both efficiency and decoupling at different intensities below VT2.\n\nPost 10 by BlackTek:\nThank you @Robert_UCL and @Alex - I really appreciate your feedbacks. I\u2019ll do the test tomorrow early morning (wake-up at 04:15 am to finish by 7am and bring kids at school :)) I\u2019ll do the test like this: I\u2019ve verified from past the last workout that my bpm is normally quite low until I start going above 70% FTP. Last Saturday it was 130bpm at 78% ftp (over 5 minutes after 15 minutes warm-up) After the AeT I\u2019ll do my next workout from CJ (I\u2019ll just skip first cooldown and second warmup to stay in more or less 2 hours): image812\u00d7424 20 KB I\u2019ll share the results, perhaps a nice discussion to elaborate the results will start. Probably this weekend I\u2019ll do another FTP test after the first 2 months of training. Thank you again!\n\nPost 11 by BlackTek:\ndo you think it\u2019s ok to do the test without breakfast and just an espresso coffee? Coffee might impact HR a bit, but I take 6-7 per day, so it\u2019s part of my regular schedule. Probably better to don\u2019t ingest carbs or other things. For me it\u2019s fine to do like that for all AeT tests (and in the end it\u2019s better to avoid sugars around, to give a stronger signal to the body to use fat, despite 80\u2019 test is really short)\n\nPost 12 by Alex:\nIt\u2019s sounding like you have a very good aerobic base 5-time Ironman winner Mark Allen followed low hr training and when his base was very strong he would do intervals at AeT because it was not easy. I experienced this to some degree as well about 12 years ago. Would love to hear your test results but if you have a very optimized aerobic system you may not see a ton of progress. Although if you read and follow Maffetone you might see improvement but usually better to start late fall.\n\nPost 13 by Alex:\nSFR #7 enjoy.",

        "text": "000 and I can see this little line showing up because we have W Prime Bal turned on you know you can see this little line showing up and because this is over my FTP this means your energy level is going down you're running out of that store and then as you get back down to this recovery then it goes back up again and your energy level gets back to full your your anerobic energy level gets back up to 100% again so this is especially useful when you're doing intervals so now let's just do like five intervals of 1 minute each at 120% and then let's do 1 minute at 50% so now you can see it goes down it recovers it goes down it recovers it goes down it recovers as this dotted line gets down so let's change this to 130% as this dotted line uh we can get off there as this dotted line goes down and it starts getting below this line and gets especially as it gets close to the bottom it gets really hard it's like it feels like I just can't do anymore and if you do 150% right it takes me all the way down to the point of that I've hit zero now that zero is just a mathematical guess as to where your actual energy level is going to run out it's pretty close and pretty accurate but you may find you know that this 14 kog Jews is not perfectly accurate maybe it's 15 maybe it's something else ultimately this is how you can design a workout to take you to your maximum level of fatigue and then you can compare it and try it and say oh did I do it was I able to complete it could I do a little bit more so if it's under FTP it doesn't affect that your W Prime balance right if it's over FTP then it will take your balance down so then when if we come into trainer day here and we we look around at any given workout like this workout I can see also here that if I'm 168 and 14 k then this workout takes me down to a pretty low Place meaning I'm pretty tired but not not dead and it just keeps getting a little bit lower and then it kind of flattens off this would be a very hard workout for most people now if if I only had a 10 K this would be basic Bally an impossible workout for me so it's not only dependent on your critical power but it's also dependent on your your W Prime and this dotted line is called your W Prime balance it's the remaining balance you have left of your W Prime energy source people also call that Anor robic work capacity right or AWC right so anyway so that's a basics of how you can use this tool to design really hard workouts that take you to your maximum fatigue levels and you could do that either in a single interval right I can take a single interval for for uh 20 minutes and put it at 120% and it's going to there's no way I'm going to be able to do that right even 110% there's no way I'm going to be able to do that for 20 minutes can I do it for 10 minutes maybe so 10 minutes at 110% slightly possible I could do it not very likely but slightly possible anyway or or that could be 3 minutes at 150% right so I can't do that 140 can I do 3 minutes at 140 3 minutes and 130 135 so I could probably do 3 minutes at 135 if I have a 10 kle limit at 168 Watts so that's it thank you",

        "text": "YouTube Video: W Prime Deep-Dive using the TrainerDay Workout Creator.\n\nTranscript:\nhello Alex from trainer day here I'm going to go a little bit deeper into W Prime balance and how it works so I've got an example workout here you can see it's 60 minutes at a hundred percent which is basically an impossible workout for everybody that's got their FTP set correctly or nobody would be willing to ever do this or try to do this anyway what you can see here is you can see this red dotted line and that is my W Prime balance a room or my remaining energy and this is like a gas tank since it's at the top your gas tank is completely full you're not draining your anaerobic energy now in reality you are at a hundred percent you probably are a little bit but as the model goes you're not so my point is that this is not designed for measuring your aerobic difficulty or how hard a workout is it's only to measure how much anaerobe remaining anaerobic energy you have so we can take another workout this is under overs and you can see that even then even though it does go a little bit over your FTP and is using a little bit anaerobic it's still not a good indicator of how hard this is this is actually still very hard and you wouldn't notice that so so let's go to a more of an anaerobic workout so here we've got an anaerobic workout that goes up to let's say a hundred and fifty percent of your you know of your FTP this is a Tabata style workout and so this is 40 seconds of work with 20 seconds of rest and so this is where W prime bow really works is for these higher intensity interval training right and or just anything that's noticeably above your FTP and then you can see you know you have this little warm-up here and it drops a little bit but it almost recovers completely but then it drops down perfectly right meaning it's dropping down and so by the end of this fourth interval you should be completely drained but this is designed for a person with a hundred and ninety three what you know FTP or critical power and a fourteen kilojoule w prime if this is not you let's just say you have a 300 watt FTP at a 14 watt kilojoule now this workout is incredibly hard you will you will it you can't even finish the third repetition of this right because it's too hard for you now if you're you know kilojoules are higher let's say 20 again then it's perfect for you and so it totally depends on what your actual FTP are and how many kilojoules you have right or how much your W prime Bala your W prime is it you know how many kilojoules do you have in your W prime so let's just say that you you know have a twenty kilojoule two hundred watt let's just do two hundred 120 kilojoules now this is an easy workout for you it's a moderately easy it's not too hard so what do you do you make it harder right so so maybe you need a hundred and sixty percent right or 165 right so then you can see now it's getting close to failure again so you adjust your workouts to make them so that you're getting close to failure right you know you don't have to go all the way to failure right you know what you may want to do and and what marked from golden cheetah recommended to me is that you may want you know you may be a writer that going to failure is fine you like FTP tests you like going as hard and you it like hitting the end other writers don't like that so much and so you may want to do more reps let's just let's add a rep in here I'm gonna move this one down a row and I'm gonna add another rep like this and and I'm gonna make this just one of these and I'm going to lower the intensity in this one 150 oops so 160 and 140 130 so so now you can see we actually have to close to failure points but not complete failure so your motivation level might be higher too to get too close to failures than rather than one total failure so you you want to kind of play around with this and see what's better for you to close to failures might produce better results or similar results as one total failure and it mentally might be easier and less challenging for you so you want to find",

I\u2019m starting to put my ATP together, with a A-event on June (end of the month). I\u2019ve quantified TSS for my strength workouts (upper and lower) using Joe Friel\u2019s method, but I\u2019m really thinking on using only lower body workouts TSS data to enter on my calendar, since upper body TSS data can somehow give a wrong impression on real form/fatigue numbers on the bike. Can you give me your feedback on this? Thanks.\nContext: User is planning a training schedule and is concerned about TSS data.\nUser Problem: Confusion about how to accurately track TSS for upper and lower body workouts.\nAnswer: Hi Snaavt, Sounds like you\u2019re creating a good plan. I Like where you are going with that A-race. I\u2019m a big fan of Joe, too. However, I found that I was already coaching many of the same principles when I discovered him. I interviewed him once when one of his books was published. Nice guy. I wouldn\u2019t split up the TSS. Any workout has an impact on your body. Leaving out these work-outs gives you the wrong impression of your total load. I don\u2019t know what kind of work you are doing, but let\u2019s create two versions of you. One version works as a paver, working five days a week. The other version of you works 3 days a week as a librarian. Which job will give you the best opportunity to be the best cyclist you can be? As a full-time paver, you will have less time to train, and your weekly load is much higher before you even get onto your bike. Every load on your body needs time to recover. Yesterday, I rode 100km on my gravel bike to my family for Christmas. At a speed of 29km/h, it was a moderately heavy ride. The reason I feel it today is because I have been sitting on a crappy folding chair the whole evening instead of lying on the couch doing nothing. Everything you do has an impact on the end result. If you are working with a good plan, the way you have set it up now, all those details matter. Let every workout count for TSS and fatigue. As a fan of Joe, you are probably planning to use a log. You could simply give the TSS from your (upper body) strength training a different color. This way, you are not ignoring it in your weekly load, but you can pick it out easily. Have a great day, Coach Robert\nSolution: Recommended not to split TSS and suggested a color-coding system for tracking.\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: Thank you so much for your input!

I was happily surprised to find rowing workouts now available here and i look forward to trying them. Just trying t get everything synced at the moment. Has anyone tried the 3 disciplines together any ideas for how to plan them all together?

I also believe in this same strategy and have a rowing machine but after years of doing the bare minimum I am just ramping up my cycling but would love to do all 3 + weight training. I think it is a very good strategy especially if you can get the right recovery in and dial in the intensity. If you want, let me know and I can ask him to share his experience here. He seems happy to share knowledge. He does serious multi-day across Africa bike trips and stuff but he considers rowing his primary sport. Not sure if he profile is public. Strava Signup for free to see more about Johan B Join Johan B and get inspired for your next workout Rowing is not big in TrainerDay. I studied the rowing community a lot. And when you get to top coaches they suggest intervals and training with power but most fitness rowers focus on extremely constant top pace\u2026 Anyway happy to see you again.",

Merry Christmas to all!\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about effective plyometric exercise routines.\nAnswer: Hello Snaavt, What a great question. Plyo exercises are a great way to train your body; you don\u2019t have to do much to create a significant effect. They are essential because of our posture for hours on our bikes. We create a lot of power with our legs, especially the front of the legs. These muscles are well-developed. Our upper backs are stretched but not trained while cycling, hence the \u201changing\u201d shoulders and round upper back we often have. I\u2019m a big fan of tabata-style training. Different research has shown that 4 to 10 minutes for 3x a week can have a big impact. I start with a series of 6 minutes and build it up to 16 minutes. There is no minimum number of trainings. Even once a week will help. I train a system of LACC, meaning Legs, Arms, Core, and Cardio. These terms are just a reminder of specific exercises.

Rather than create Fake AI like most other platforms do, we like to do things the right way. And the right way in this case is very difficult to get all the different use cases in a quality level that we like. We are researching and experimenting creating real AI but it is complicated as well so I would not think it will be the next few months and we would still start with the basics with AI and slowly introduce more and more like complex multi-sport.

Thanks\n\nPost 2 by Robert_UCL:\nHi Bobinski, What a great post. You are taking care of yourself, and you want to know if rowing adds anything. Let me start by giving you the credit you deserve: your approach is very good. You are not just training on the bike, but you are doing more to stay healthy and maintain your overall fitness. Keep that up. At the same time, you wonder if rowing ads anything and if you can swap it for your recovery ride. The big question is: what is more important to you? Overall health or pure cycling performance? If you look at it from a cycling performance point of view, I would say that you are doing enough strength training, and there is no need to do anything else. A recovery ride on the bike would probably be more efficient. You are focussing on the right muscles to recover, and there is no chance of extra stress from another movement, like using your arms more than on the bike. Looking at this from the health perspective, I say it is a great way to increase the diversity of mobility while recovering from all the work you have done in the previous days. Basically, there is no difference in what you do during a recovery ride. You can go for a swim, ride your bike, take a walk, etc. Of course, when you start a new activity, you need to build up strength and stamina for that particular activity, but once you get to a basic level, it really doesn\u2019t matter.

solo rides do you want to increase your speed or improve your performance well the good news is that getting faster on your bike can be simply achieved by adhering to our four performance pillars keep watching because at the end of this video we offer a special bonus tip a cycling performance booster hi this is Alex from trainer day trainer day is an indoor outdoor training platform I work closely with Andrea Morelli Andrea is one of the top evidence-based cycling coaches in the world together we will bring you simple concise training advice optimizing your training volume is the first and most important pillar to improving your performance complex training plans and Magic workouts are unnecessary until you're approaching the limits of your personal performance Frank Overton of fast cat coaching is credited with being the pioneer of sweet spot and TSS based cycling in the following video clip Frank emphasizes that increase training volume alone is usually the key to your best seasonal performance and you know did you train more in 2019 than you did in 2018 if you did I bet you had a better season this would suggest that Frank also believes that volume is a more critical Factor than specific workouts or plans we would add to that and say that the right volume at the right time will usually provide you with your best results so what does the right volume at the right time mean it means rearranging your yearly cycling hours by decreasing at certain points in time and increasing others can yield substantially better results even if you're a time crunch cyclist pillar number two consistency it's optimal to have very consistent weekly patterns in your training volume if you're like me this may not happen if you have an incredibly busy week instead of your planned workouts you could fill it in with some very short indoor workouts evidence shows that 10 minute hit or Tabata session 20 minutes including a warm-up can augment your training gaps number three recovery performance gains happen during your recovery periods sleep is the most important method of recovery if you don't sleep at least eight hours a night eight plus being ideal start by turning off any screens an hour before your desired bedtime you can also try the weight lifter secret of taking zma zma contains the vitamin zinc and magnesium it's healthy and it works and it does not create the groggy morning feeling like melatonin if you train consistently patterns of daily weekly monthly and yearly recovery have been the gold standard for many decades for maximizing results taking a day or more off each week a week or more off each month and a few weeks off each year as well as a base period each season will give your body the rest it needs to increase to the next level if you have been cycling consistently and eating well but flatlined in your performance not having the right recovery pattern is probably the reason our fourth and final pillar is about workouts evidence suggests that if you are training six hours a week or more spend most of your time following low heart rate easy rides the start of your season could be all easy rides and slowly as your season progresses you increase the intensity for many cyclists going easy is more difficult than going hard getting fast requires self-control your harder workouts don't need to be complex and you don't need to kill yourself but you will see benefit from following a progressive overload pattern this means slowly and systematically increasing either your intensity your duration or both as Dr Seiler of polarized training points out hard efforts don't need to be incredibly hard and should be sustainable we take that a little further and suggest that you can start with easy intervals and build to hard intervals the polarized Studies have also proven that lower intensity weeks can beat higher intensity weeks so be very careful when you're trying to substitute intensity for volume for most cyclists the most important overload is regarding a weekly long ride you should try to fit in a long ride each week and start small and continually build the duration to your maximum occurring around a month before any event we feel that software platforms and many coaches have put too much emphasis on highly structured training that we also agree that simple moderate sustainable intervals will add horsepower to your already volume-based aerobic engine Outdoors Hills are a great place to do workouts either hill repeats or longer Hills can be Optimum higher intensity intervals and Hill training is most important as you get closer to your peak season ideally this follows a pattern of progressive overload as well and for our bonus tip popular and pro cycling in recent years during your peak season add full effort intervals this means pushing yourself to the maximum for two to",

        "text": "Rowing FTP is quite a bit lower, and SkiErg FTP is almost certainly lower than RowErg FTP, etc.\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nYes, I have had a few people ask for ski-erg. We want to go more down the multi-sport route but are just very small and realize that we need to perfect cycling before optimizing multi-sport. I will think about when we might be able to do it. As you mentioned it\u2019s probably not too hard (at least the simpler parts) but really we should try to do it the right way this time. Doing in the website is one thing but we don\u2019t have clear seperation at this point. Meaning you can have a cycling workout and do it in rowERG mode for example. So we should fully separate the sports first.\n\nPost 3 by Aren:\nThanks for the response. I understand what you\u2019re saying but I also think you\u2019re over-complicating at this point . Further down the line, absolutely have really elegantly siloed/delineated training calendars/filters/nice UI that represents these different sport types and keeps everything beautifully presented for multi-sport. That is a stretch/phase 2 goal. (For reference, I work as a software developer). But most people do their analysis (if they are so inclined) in TrainingPeaks or intrevals.icu or WKO or Strava, etc., and use TrainerDay for their workout delivery. So at this point, for a \u201cminimum viable solution\u201d to this feature request, it is actually relatively straightforward, since you\u2019ve already implemented 95% of it anyway. Basically: Let the categories/mappings be user-defined names (not just fixed to Cycling/RowErg/SkiErg) for sport type to FTP. Allow there to be more of them (you can restrict this a subscriber feature), not just three. Simply use the existing toggle/menu dropdown, or, better still, just have a button somewhere that someone jabs to switch between the \u201cexercise type profile\u201d, which flips and icon, and then they can do whatever workout they like, but with that corresponding FTP setting. I realise there is a little bit more in terms of workouts being correctly mapped at correct type on other platforms, etc., but even if my rowing workout got sync\u2019d elsewhere as a cycling workout (for example), it takes literally a few seconds to alter it on the destination platform. Even an unpolished first variant would basically offer something nobody else really offers in a convenient manner.\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nBut user defined names does not really work, meaning they ultimately need to align with a sport type in TP, Strava, Garmin and others or else users will end up having problems (can\u2019t sync for example). So in order for us to add it to the app to execute it needs to be fully supported every where because it is all an integrated system. Additionally the more exceptions to how things work we have the more users get confused and have problems. We are trying to move toward more simple, clear consistent user experiences. So while I appreciate what you are asking for, what we usually find is the farther we dig into it, it might be more complex than it sounds. I am not saying we won\u2019t do it. It\u2019s just this winter at the very least we are very focused on perfecting our cycling experience. We have way more to get done then we can probably even do before the winter comes to an end.\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nYes, I feel the same way. Especially adding SkiERG. As more C2 users focus on power not pace our app becomes more relevant (if we improve if)\n\nPost 7 by Aren:\nI think you could solve for the user-simplicity by having most of this stuffed/hidden away into an \u201cAdvanced Features/Beta/Multisport\u201d section that is disabled by default.",

So for the 97% (or whatever that % is) of TD users who only ever use your application with their turbo trainer, none of this would be enabled by default and everything would just be bike focused only. So the user-experience for \u201ctypical\u201d TD cyclists is unaffected. Sport type mappings are always an intrinsic problem because, fundamentally, sport type mappings are so poorly catered for by EVERYONE, including the biggest players like Garmin, TP, etc. Basically, if you do something other than running or cycling, things are never well catered for, even today. It is quite suprising it remains this way even after two decades+ of fitness devices/platforms. For example, I have to map SkiErg to XC Ski in TrainingPeaks, for example, which is not ideal. Since I don\u2019t ever get to do actual XC Skiing (I wish!), it isn\u2019t really an issue, but I can imagine a TP user/real XC Ski athlete who actually does get to do real XC Ski training in-season together with sessions on the SkiErg off-season, it\u2019d be kind of annoying for them. Anyway, I digress and mention this purely to illustrate that sport-mappings are just one of those intrinsic \u201cpoorly solved for\u201d issues with all sports software, for no particulary good reason. Meanwhile, at an API/logic level, it is just a matter of having the correct \u201cfallback\u201d sports/assignment set when type X does not exist on platform Y. As a software/logic integration issue, it is not particularly difficult to solve/cater for, mostly annoying, as you end up having to maintain a set of per-API/per-service mappings, to ensure that all activities will always sync regardless of the input sport \u201ctype\u201d, even if that means the target sport type on platform Y for type X is a default fallback (e.g. \u201cworkout\u201d). The interesting thing is there is an \u201ceducational\u201d issue here. For whatever reason, irrespective of the incredible fitness accomplishments and sports specific training knowledge that exists in the rowing/erging community, it does seem that they are behind the curve (compared to the cycling community) in terms of training optimally with power. And as you note, Alex, the C2 community in particularly is becoming more \u201cpower\u201d conscious with every year (e.g. EXR Rowing is entirely based around it/rowing FTP. But TrainerDay has a far richer workout library than EXR, so for those of us who care more about workout libraries/training programs versus fancy gaming graphics, TD could/should be the one-erg-training-library-program-to-rule-them-all). Power has a much finer granularity of scaling versus pace, that also remains linear, unlike pace, so that\u2019s the biggest thing. From a commercial point of view, though this market may start off as \u201cniche\u201d, I think there is a real opportunity to develop it.",

I\u2019m going to incorporate a similar routine, only more focused on legs and core. I do plan to work on my upper body though. On the gym, just to balance muscle growth on lower and upper body. I\u2019m starting to put my ATP together, with a A-event on June (end of the month). I\u2019ve quantified TSS for my strength workouts (upper and lower) using Joe Friel\u2019s method, but I\u2019m really thinking on using only lower body workouts TSS data to enter on my calendar, since upper body TSS data can somehow give a wrong impression on real form/fatigue numbers on the bike. Can you give me your feedback on this? Thanks.\nContext: User is planning a training schedule and is concerned about TSS data.\nUser Problem: Confusion about how to accurately track TSS for strength workouts.\nAnswer: Hi Snaavt, Sounds like you\u2019re creating a good plan. I Like where you are going with that A-race. I\u2019m a big fan of Joe, too. However, I found that I was already coaching many of the same principles when I discovered him. I interviewed him once when one of his books was published. Nice guy. I wouldn\u2019t split up the TSS. Any workout has an impact on your body. Leaving out these work-outs gives you the wrong impression of your total load. I don\u2019t know what kind of work you are doing, but let\u2019s create two versions of you. One version works as a paver, working five days a week. The other version of you works 3 days a week as a librarian. Which job will give you the best opportunity to be the best cyclist you can be? As a full-time paver, you will have less time to train, and your weekly load is much higher before you even get onto your bike. Every load on your body needs time to recover. Yesterday, I rode 100km on my gravel bike to my family for Christmas. At a speed of 29km/h, it was a moderately heavy ride. The reason I feel it today is because I have been sitting on a crappy folding chair the whole evening instead of lying on the couch doing nothing. Everything you do has an impact on the end result. If you are working with a good plan, the way you have set it up now, all those details matter. Let every workout count for TSS and fatigue. As a fan of Joe, you are probably planning to use a log. You could simply give the TSS from your (upper body) strength training a different color. This way, you are not ignoring it in your weekly load, but you can pick it out easily.

Many of our users do this now. It\u2019s a nice solution. Using Garmin to control the training is not ideal, so just recording the workout on it solves this problem. I had a garmin before and struggled to get it to control in ERG also but many people also do this. I gave my tester my Garmin 530 and he can do it no problem. I use Wahoo now.

It\u2019s likely a delay or an error thrown in your trainer but TR is obviously much more mature so might have special code for your trainer to increase the target time they send it. We have thousands of users and this is the first time I have heard of a delay like this, although, other users had a problem where their devices throw errors and so what we do is keep sending updates which might delay it. TR might have some magic formula to dealing with these device errors that we are not aware of how to do. If you can repeat this regularly and be willing to work with my developer then we could find the source of the problem. It\u2019s good to know that TR did not do this.\nSolution: Work with the developer to find the source of the problem.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Sorry for the slight off topic, but is the power target supposed to happen as soon as I get the audio prompt, or is the audio prompt sent a little earlier to get you ready?

Dropping power level seems to work faster by 1 second in my perceived feeling. To summarise, try seeing how power smoothing affects power control by the trainer device - maybe it\u2019s already working fine or needs a little improvement.\n\nPost 14 by Alex:\nGood to hear it\u2019s working better. You also might enjoy trying slope mode for short intervals but 15s I like ERG. Smoothing is visual only so something strange must have occurred to help resolve your issue. Good news if it stays fixed.\n\nPost 15 by frnkr:\nI came to the forum looking for an answer because I have a similar problem. When I start my session the app won\u2019t change the right power unless I manually decrease the wattage to 90% and change the power back to 100% after few sec when the app is starting to change the wattage. It\u2019s a small thing but very annoying. Other than this everything works flawlessly. My trainer is Tacx wheel-on model and I think this has started lately. Any idea why this is happening eg has there been any change in the Power Match or in the other code related to the trainer control?\n\nPost 16 by Alex:\nSorry to hear. Yes, we recently changed power control to fix a different device. That\u2019s the problem is sadly each device works differently and occassionaly an update to fix one negatively affects another. Surprising as the problem we fixed for one device is the problem you now have. Let me see if my developer can review or see any reason why this might happen. I will respond soon.\n\nPost 17 by Postmeister:\nHi Alex. Isn\u2019t that the same issue as described here: Intermittent target change problems using ERG - #16 by inuitive\n\nPost 18 by Alex:\nYes, didn\u2019t you have this problem as well? We recently fixed it but I forgot to ask you if it fixed it for you.",

My nature is that I get pleasure out of making my cycling stuff (bike, kit, indoor set up etc etc) work perfectly for me and so creating new workouts is all part of the fun\ud83d\ude04. However the downside is that embarrassingly if the interval calls for 220w and my average is only 219w then somehow that feels nowhere near as satisfying as 220w\ud83e\udd21!!!\n\nPost 7 by kam:\nYour manual power match off set is interesting and got me thinking. This is probably totally impractical or not possible but just to add to the conversation and thought evolution process, For me it would be cool to have a manual power match option where all data displayed in the app is from the power meter and the original workout. However the app is using just the smart trainer to control erg mode. The original workout file could have an additional column for \u201cmanual erg mode off set\u201d where you could enter the relevant off set you would like applied to each interval step. Then the icing the cake would be to have a universal off set matrix withins your account which would be applied to all workouts if the manual power match option was selected. This universal off set matrix would allow you to set the required off set for all of your commonly used FTP%'s.\n\nPost 8 by Alex:\nInteresting idea. This is basically like our automated slope mode but automated ERG adjustment mode. Just to show visual version like below. Like you said it\u2019s a hidden offset so you don\u2019t really see it other than maybe a small number like power match is now. image1898\u00d71616 284 KB I don\u2019t think that many people would want this but I can say it\u2019s an interesting way to solve the problem. Seems like better power match would be more ideal but really this should be more accurate for your trainer but the problem is for wheel-on trainers that need power match the most this does not help. They have temperature variations. If you always kept your bike in the same gear you could do this with slope mode now\n\nPost 9 by kam:\nExcellent graphic Alex !!! Very good \u201cbalanced seeing the bigger picture\u201d view point .\n\nPost 10 by MedTechCD:\nThe situation for direct drive trainers that have very little or no temperature drift can be one of these three (actually four): Spot-on Fixed offset all over the range Offset varying by power value (speed value) Fixed + variable offset This should be easy to correct for by simply applying a formula behind the screens like Corrected value = x + y * applied value. Where x is the fixed offset and y a parameter for the variable part. You would off course need to fine-tune both values for your specific trainer compared to your power meter. It can be of some value for wheel-on trainers but those will still have considerable drift caused by heat. My suggestion would be to apply the formula behind the scenes and have both correction values as a setting.\n\nPost 11 by Alex:\nAnother good idea. @kam my guess is fixed + offset would solve your problem and be a one time apply, set and forget. @MedTechCD is this something you would like as well?",

However sometimes it is nice to have a bit of a change and so I have been using Erg mode and it is not quite working for me like it used to on TR. My Neo 2 over reads compared to my Assioma Duo\u2019s at endurance power. At sweet spot they are sort of similar and then at Vo2 the Neo under reads compared to my Assioma. So jumping from 40% recovery to 120% intervals really kills me as the power match takes about 30 seconds of about 130-140% effort before it recalibrates the power match off set to bring me down to 120%. Is it possible for the power match algorithm to be reworked such that it is a bit more responsive? Many thanks for all your help. Karl\nContext: User is comparing performance between different modes and devices.\nUser Problem: Power match takes too long to recalibrate during intervals.\nAnswer: There is a bug going from slope mode to erg with power match, but yes we also need to create a new version of power match. Another solution is to turn off power match, but it will still record power from pedals, and just press - to slight adjust actual target. This should give you exactly what you need if your offset is consistent and you don\u2019t mind that actual shows different then target by a little\nSolution: Turn off power match and manually adjust the target.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I understand entirely and thank you for your comments. I have done a work around for myself in line with your comments. Initially I did a dual recorded workout (TD - Neo Erg / Garmin - Assioma) with TD setting the erg power for all of my common interval FTP percentages. From the data I created a little spreadsheet showing the results and what the Neo Erg needs to be set at so that Assioma\u2019s power is appropriate. Then I made Erg mode versions of my upcoming workouts with the FTP percentages suitably adjusted (ie 40% is now 45%, 108% is now 106%, 125% is now 120% etc). Then in the interval comments I put the real target watts for me to monitor on my Garmin watch and make on the fly adjustments as necessary. Worked perfectly the first time I tried it with Neo only connected to TD and Assioma\u2019s only connected to Garmin. Disregard the TD workout & save the Garmin workout.\nContext: User implemented a workaround to adjust power settings.\nUser Problem: Need for precise power settings during workouts.\nAnswer: Oh thank you for the feedback. My thinking is that level of precision is not that important (Our Coach Andrea generally thinks so as well) and if you agreed you could just connect both assioma and neo to our app and press -5% and make your warmups a little harder in general. At least you could just design your workouts normally.

The simplest is just to press slope mode and possibly shift gears or press + - to get to the intensity level you want. Now if you want to resume from where you were at you would need to just keep pedalling at low intensity, and reselect the same workout and it would merge them together and press skip a few times to get back to where you were at and press ERG again. Now this probably requires 5-10 clicks. We want to add the ability to insert a segment or interval set which would be closer to what you want and could probably do this in a couple clicks with less brain power required.\nSolution: Press slope mode and adjust intensity manually; future feature to insert segments.",

But from physiological point it doesn\u2019t matter as it depends on the actual form of the day. If you really want to train in a zone you must design your training in the middle of the zone or a few percentage away from the limit e.g. at 58% or 72% (dependent on your trainer and the accuracy of your powermeter as well). Absolutely agree with that. If you train with zone targets, stay away from the limits. But people tend to think that chasing the upper limit of the zone is \u2018better\u2019. In fact, it\u2019s detrimental because you end up with way too much time out of your target zone. Just target the middle of the zone and allow yourself to wander within the zone iso. keeping that same target value. But as @app4g responded, I think the request is about workouts with a fixed target and how far you would be allowed to differ from that target. And since Power is intrinsically a metric that jumps around quite a bit, you will need about 5% tolerance, or you need to set a moving average (3s or maybe even 5s) for power readings. Newguy: Is 10\u00b1 watts ok or should you be closer to target. I don\u2019t know what the answer is Any normal training workout will not be influenced by this. There\u2019s no need to be exactly on a Power target. You need to be around the target to train the physiological adaptation.\n\nPost 16 by Alex:\nI am suggestion this. So you can see below my target zone is orange (VO2max) and my actual zone is Anaerobic (red), but because I am not off by more than 5% the actual Watts number of 226 is still white, or it could be grey for example. image1402\u00d71290 115 KB It\u2019s obvious I am in the wrong zone because of the color differences but it\u2019s not so serious that I need to change the color of the watts to red. Does this make sense.\n\nPost 17 by Alex:\nI fully, fully agree with this. The problem is someone just grabs a workout from our library and it is already at the limit. I would be better if people targets were always in the middle if they truely wanted to try to be more likely to match the physciological effect with the math theory Mostly this feature is for people that are in slope mode or don\u2019t have a smart trainer. ALso it would not turn red if you don\u2019t turn on zone modes. If you have a smart trainer in ERG mode you should choose your zones by picking your workout.\n\nPost 18 by MedTechCD:\nThat is totally confusing to me. Partially because you are not following the colors that most people are used to (the garmin ones: Grey=Recovery, Blue=Endurance, Green=Tempo, Orange=Threshold, Red=VO2max and Purple=Anaerobic). So here is my try at it: For target, color the numbers in the physiological zone color For actual watts, color the bar or background only when out of range. Use a single color (red?) no matter if it is low or high. That way it is clear that the Target color and the watts color are giving different information.",

Partially because you are not following the colors that most people are used to (the garmin ones: Grey=Recovery, Blue=Endurance, Green=Tempo, Orange=Threshold, Red=VO2max and Purple=Anaerobic). So here is my try at it: For target, color the numbers in the physiological zone color For actual watts, color the bar or background only when out of range. Use a single color (red?) no matter if it is low or high. That way it is clear that the Target color and the watts color are giving different information. You immediately know what physiological zone you are targetting, and also, if what you\u2019re doing is in agreement with what the workout prescribes. if you\u2019re doing it right, only the target color will jump out. That avoids a distracting rainbow view, only confusing you.\n\nPost 19 by Alex:\nI used these colors image946\u00d7770 77.1 KB These seem to be zwifts colors. I don\u2019t know what the standard is\u2026 But yes we are saying the same thing. Target color is target zone and actual color is actual power, and Red number is watts # if too high or too low.\n\nPost 20 by Newguy:\nAs I suggested the plus or minus 10 thing, I thought I better respond. I\u2019ve got a spin bike with a power meter on it. I\u2019m also using the coach Jack fitness cyclist plan. I tend to watch Netflix well working out. As I\u2019ve got to manually change gears on my bike to get to target I use the current power zone setting to make sure am hitting the target. It\u2019s just really useful quickly seeing feedback if I\u2019m not hitting the target. I don\u2019t have a smart trainer that will make sure I hit the target. Plus or minus 10 was a stab in the dark. It could be 5 or 3 or whatever makes most sense. For me I am assuming the captain Jack plan has been well thought out so I just want to ride to target. hope that makes sense.",

This question deserves its own video for an answer but I am on vacation so it will have to wait. Funny you found that video. It\u2019s supposed to be private, that I was sharing with my designer Target watts or target percentage is the same thing, just a different way of looking at it. Your FTP is the power you can do for 40-60 minutes. Say that is 200 watts for simplicity. So 140 watts and 70% of FTP are the same thing just two different ways to look at it. That way our blue charts look the same for everyone but stronger riders the watts will be higher but percentages will be higher because they have a higher FTP. Hope that helps.\nSolution: Target watts and target percentage are the same; explained in terms of FTP.",

I try to keep my cadence constant during the ramp up to the interval. If I decrease my cadence to reduce power it feels like I\u2019m grinding it out below 80rpm. I use a spider based power meter on my bike and have power match turned on. Any suggestions to help reduce the duration/power of these overshoots?\nContext: User is experiencing issues with power overshooting during intervals.\nUser Problem: Overshooting power targets and slow response time to match target power.\nAnswer: Our power match is not optimum for short duration higher intensity changes. TrainerRoad had the same problem for about 8 years until they improved theirs. It\u2019s complicated to do. The simple solution would be for us to just provide an offset (in addition to) rather than a new power match. This would likely mostly fix the problem. I would not be perfect but it would be better for bigger interval changes like these. Sorry I have no better suggestion at this point. You could turn off power match and press + or -. This is basically what offset would do but the problem is without an offset feature your power would always be at a different level than the target or the graph, so it looks worse.\nSolution: Consider turning off power match and manually adjusting power with + or - buttons.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Is there any chance that I could send the workout to my Garmin Edge 840 (after upgrading to Premium) and have the workout use Garmin\u2019s ERG mode to force a tighter watt tolerance? That or\u2026 can the calculation be set to undershoot by 10% or so and then settle into the interval\u2019s watts?\nContext: User is considering upgrading to Premium and wants to know about Garmin integration.\nUser Problem: Overshooting power during intervals and seeking tighter watt tolerance.\nAnswer: Yes you can send to your Garmin with upgrade. Garmin\u2019s ERG mode should not be any different than ours. I don\u2019t believe they have a power match feature. These users say the same. So while they might display the watts different they will have the same problem. forums.garmin.com Power Meter and ERG Mode during a workout - Edge 1040 Series - Cycling -... A dedicated community for Garmin users to ask questions, provide answers, and share feedback. For many people doing short intervals, they prefer slope mode to manually hit the target watts with slope, cadence and gears. You can edit our workouts to manually add slope mode intervals to automatically change the workout, but if you decide to do that you might want to ask me for some help in designing those workouts. FYI - One user told me in the past slope mode did not work very well with his Wahoo Rollr and our app. I don\u2019t know if that is still the case. The other thing to do is just change your FTP in our app, or press the + - buttons to adjust the intervals right before you hit them. I guess you know this, but ultimately it does not matter what you see on the screen from a training perspective, it just matters what hits your legs\u2026 But I realize getting accurate your data for analysis can be important. As long as you are recording from your pedals (our app records single sided only) then the accuracy should be fine.\nSolution: You can send workouts to Garmin, but it may not resolve the overshooting issue. Consider using slope mode or adjusting FTP.",

Your request, helped my thinking on this.\n\nPost 11 by Newguy:\nAlex that is really good. I think you and your programmer my also need to think about what it means to be in the zone. I\u2019m seeing some bafflingly results. I can be riding at the target watts but red text is being displayed to tell my I\u2019m not in the zone. Is 10\u00b1 watts ok or should you be closer to target. I don\u2019t know what the answer is Ps solomko suggestion of making the whole of the watts box red when not in the zone is good. It would certainly make being out of zone more obvious\n\nPost 12 by Alex:\nI agree with \u00b15% good idea but not red box also this fed indicator will only be in zone mode and be 3s average.\n\nPost 13 by KaRo:\nFTP may change a few percentage from day to day, but I know exactly what FTP I set in the app and the lower and upper limit watts of my zones. On the other hand zones have a range e.g. endurance 55%-75% of FTP. If you want to train at a zone limit you may be under and over it a few watts and from mathematical point of view it matters. But from physiological point it doesn\u2019t matter as it depends on the actual form of the day. If you really want to train in a zone you must design your training in the middle of the zone or a few percentage away from the limit e.g. at 58% or 72% (dependent on your trainer and the accuracy of your powermeter as well). From my perspective TrainerDay indicators should rely on the simple mathematical zone model limits that means e.g. green 55%-75% and red <55% or >75%, . Other ideas are much more complicate to understand. I don\u2019t understand what 5% (from FTP?) or 10 watts (above the upper limit?) mean.\n\nPost 14 by app4g:\nI believe the suggestion is for a the Upper / Lower number to be a % point from the target value. eg: Target Value = 50% of FTP (assume it\u2019s 100w) then the Upper / Lower limit would be 90w - 110w w/ a target of 100w (+/-10% from target) If not mistaken, for Garmin, the default is like +/-3 watts (from a very few workout files I\u2019ve seen)\n\nPost 15 by MedTechCD:\nKaRo: If you want to train at a zone limit you may be under and over it a few watts and from mathematical point of view it matters.

I would say if you are doing 15 minute workouts cadence targts are not important, over all they make a small difference in general but they bring some more interest to the workout and can help some people over a longer period of time.\nSolution: Clarification on cadence targets insertion based on workout length.",

If you are using our calendar than just clicking edit from the calendar to the plan and reviewing it and saving it would update your plan.\n\nPost 7 by Bree:\nWill these also transfer over thru Zwift? I was just going to ask about prescribed cadence work within the workouts! Glad to see\n\nPost 8 by Alex:\nYes. With TrainingPeaks free version you can Use our calendar sync and get it each day Push one workout at a time With TP premium you can push full plan to TP Or you can download the whole plan in ZWO and put it in zwift folder We are hoping for direct integration but still it\u2019s closed off.\n\nPost 9 by Bree:\nI should have been more specific\u2026 I meant the cadence additions to the workouts\n\nPost 10 by Alex:\nIt should but we have not tested it. Also the cadence targets are just sprinkled in to some zone 2 stuff so there is not a lot of it. We can add more if people want. We will try to test next week to make sure it goes to TP and is in the ZWO files. I think it should be in ZWO files for sure But TD>TP>Zwift I am less sure about.\n\nPost 11 by gomeskiller1:\nAlex. I think you should add more cadence to your exercises. motivates more in more focused exercise and notices an improvement in the athlete\u2019s fitness\n\nPost 12 by Alex:\nOk it\u2019s easy for us to add more. Maybe I should make it a setting that a user can adjust. Lot\u2019s of cadence work for example. We are not convinced it makes a big difference at least in the short term, but in the long term we do believe it can help some people and probably the right amounts of consistent cadence training could make a bigger difference. I will make a seperate task for this. You are a vote for more\n\nPost 13 by gomeskiller1:\nYes Alex, I\u2019m not saying that in exercise there are cadences in everything but rather where the work is more focused on the athlete. For example, at the beginning, for example, if you are going to do hits, it is normal to do one or another gradual exercise at a 90 to 100 cadence during the warm-up. so that then n HITT of 30s at 1m at 400W with 90 cadence at 1 second hitt 95 and so on. In the equal threshold exercise. That hug and whatever you can help, send a bomb\n\nPost 14 by Alex:\nOh that\u2019s interesting. I am talking to Andrea about this and he works more with pros. So I am not very familiar with cadence work myself. This makes sense. I like this idea. I will ask some more coaches as well. The translation of what you sent is great!!! I don\u2019t know if you use ChatGPT for translating but it is a very good translator. Especially for complicated stuff.",

This next version of our app I am still taking the simple and progressive approach to HR mode. You will be able to switch to HR mode during any workout just like slope mode and switch out of HR mode when ever you want. We won\u2019t have \u201cauto-HR\u201d intervals yet so it will require manual switching. After that we can enhance the editor to allow HR intervals. For now I am just going to turn the whole workout dark blue while in HR mode so it\u2019s obvious you are in HR mode. Kind of like below. This makes it so you can have one continuous workout with HR, ERG or slopes. Just mentioning this incase anyone catches something that I am missing My thinking is If you come from higher intensity with higher than HR target to lower intensity HR it will drop over a few minutes to 40% of FTP until your HR gets in range and then ramp up rather quickly. Not sure how this will work image1280\u00d7499 59.9 KB\n\nPost 2 by potsiea1:\nNice feature! I picture using this functionality for an ERG mode for an individualized warm-up, followed by a HR controlled main set at targetted HR.\n\nPost 3 by potsiea1:\nWhen you switch to HR mode part way through a workout with this feature, will the warm-up phase of the HR functionality be skipped?\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nI think right now what you can do (You need to test, I am not 100% sure) is start in HR, switch to ERG, do you own warmup with + - , and then when you are at your target HR switch back to HR and it should work. But yes when we add this intervals function it will also skip the warmup is the plan\n\nPost 5 by potsiea1:\nThanks. I\u2019ll give it a go Sounds like the single recording of a HR & ERG activity released now - correct? Any minimum time that you need to spend in HR mode at the start? So is the single recording of a HR & ERG released now?\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nIt was kind of a mistake that we released it, it\u2019s more like a hack I noticed. Just start in HR for 5-10 seconds should be fine then press ERG.\n\nPost 7 by potsiea1:\nI used the combined HR & ERG functionality today and it worked a treat",

Green being the green box around the target BPM. When in Zone 4 the app will not go above 150-watts, thus keeping my HR low. HR Zones overlap. Moving the target down to 100 (where the zones overlap) keeps the box around the target BPM yellow, and is considered \u201czone 4.\u201d But if you go into zone 3, IE 95BPM, and then bring it back to 100, the box stays green and HR control works. This needs to be fixed. My Hypothesis: The trainerday default FTP is 140. I suspect there is some rule in the software where is doesn\u2019t allow the trainer to go much higher than the FTP number in HR mode. Since the app seems quite FTP driven otherwise, I think this might be a possible fix to the issues I\u2019ve been having, as everything seems to work in green zone 3 with FTP set at 140. I\u2019m going to raise the FTP to 250 since I think that\u2019s more realistic and see if there are any changes on tomorrow\u2019s ride. Matt\n\nPost 18 by Alex:\nOh I think I know what it is. We have some limiter related to threshold HR I believe. So because you have your threshold HR set to 100 it\u2019s forcing a specific power limit. We are removing this threshold HR scaling in the next release so this is going to cause more of a problem for more people. My guess is if you set the threshold HR to your actual threshold HR it will fix the issue but I need to revisit this code and figure out what to do.\n\nPost 19 by Alex:\nBut yes your FTP should be set correctly as well to be safe.\n\nPost 20 by Awesomeame:\nok, so we have some success here. I turned my FTP to 250 and my HR threshold to 175, while also shortening the length of time in HR mode. I was playing around with cadence in the last half of the HR control mode. hr2224\u00d71668 183 KB HR control mode definitely works. It\u2019s quick to shed watts when HR gets higher than target, but very slow to add watts when HR is lower than target, but it does work. If you maintain HR target with no wild cadence swings it keeps it pretty close which is what I was looking for with this app. I\u2019m going to put my FTP back to 140 and run it again tonight just to isolate if this was an FTP setting or HR threshold setting Matt",

This discussion helps me in general so thanks.\n\nPost 6 by kam:\nGreat info Alex. Thank you. My nature is that I get pleasure out of making my cycling stuff (bike, kit, indoor set up etc etc) work perfectly for me and so creating new workouts is all part of the fun\ud83d\ude04. However the downside is that embarrassingly if the interval calls for 220w and my average is only 219w then somehow that feels nowhere near as satisfying as 220w\ud83e\udd21!!!\n\nPost 7 by kam:\nYour manual power match off set is interesting and got me thinking. This is probably totally impractical or not possible but just to add to the conversation and thought evolution process, For me it would be cool to have a manual power match option where all data displayed in the app is from the power meter and the original workout. However the app is using just the smart trainer to control erg mode. The original workout file could have an additional column for \u201cmanual erg mode off set\u201d where you could enter the relevant off set you would like applied to each interval step. Then the icing the cake would be to have a universal off set matrix withins your account which would be applied to all workouts if the manual power match option was selected. This universal off set matrix would allow you to set the required off set for all of your commonly used FTP%'s.\n\nPost 8 by Alex:\nInteresting idea. This is basically like our automated slope mode but automated ERG adjustment mode. Just to show visual version like below. Like you said it\u2019s a hidden offset so you don\u2019t really see it other than maybe a small number like power match is now. image1898\u00d71616 284 KB I don\u2019t think that many people would want this but I can say it\u2019s an interesting way to solve the problem. Seems like better power match would be more ideal but really this should be more accurate for your trainer but the problem is for wheel-on trainers that need power match the most this does not help. They have temperature variations. If you always kept your bike in the same gear you could do this with slope mode now\n\nPost 9 by kam:\nExcellent graphic Alex !!! Very good \u201cbalanced seeing the bigger picture\u201d view point .\n\nPost 10 by MedTechCD:\nThe situation for direct drive trainers that have very little or no temperature drift can be one of these three (actually four): Spot-on Fixed offset all over the range Offset varying by power value (speed value) Fixed + variable offset This should be easy to correct for by simply applying a formula behind the screens like Corrected value = x + y * applied value. Where x is the fixed offset and y a parameter for the variable part. You would off course need to fine-tune both values for your specific trainer compared to your power meter. It can be of some value for wheel-on trainers but those will still have considerable drift caused by heat. My suggestion would be to apply the formula behind the scenes and have both correction values as a setting.\n\nPost 11 by Alex:\nAnother good idea. @kam my guess is fixed + offset would solve your problem and be a one time apply, set and forget. @MedTechCD is this something you would like as well?",

However sometimes it is nice to have a bit of a change and so I have been using Erg mode and it is not quite working for me like it used to on TR. My Neo 2 over reads compared to my Assioma Duo\u2019s at endurance power. At sweet spot they are sort of similar and then at Vo2 the Neo under reads compared to my Assioma. So jumping from 40% recovery to 120% intervals really kills me as the power match takes about 30 seconds of about 130-140% effort before it recalibrates the power match off set to bring me down to 120%. Is it possible for the power match algorithm to be reworked such that it is a bit more responsive? Many thanks for all your help. Karl\nContext: User is comparing performance between different modes and devices.\nUser Problem: Power match takes too long to recalibrate during intervals.\nAnswer: There is a bug going from slope mode to erg with power match, but yes we also need to create a new version of power match. Another solution is to turn off power match, but it will still record power from pedals, and just press - to slight adjust actual target. This should give you exactly what you need if your offset is consistent and you don\u2019t mind that actual shows different then target by a little\nSolution: Turn off power match and manually adjust the target.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I understand entirely and thank you for your comments. I have done a work around for myself in line with your comments. Initially I did a dual recorded workout (TD - Neo Erg / Garmin - Assioma) with TD setting the erg power for all of my common interval FTP percentages. From the data I created a little spreadsheet showing the results and what the Neo Erg needs to be set at so that Assioma\u2019s power is appropriate. Then I made Erg mode versions of my upcoming workouts with the FTP percentages suitably adjusted (ie 40% is now 45%, 108% is now 106%, 125% is now 120% etc). Then in the interval comments I put the real target watts for me to monitor on my Garmin watch and make on the fly adjustments as necessary. Worked perfectly the first time I tried it with Neo only connected to TD and Assioma\u2019s only connected to Garmin. Disregard the TD workout & save the Garmin workout.\nContext: User implemented a workaround to adjust power settings.\nUser Problem: Need for precise power settings during workouts.\nAnswer: Oh thank you for the feedback. My thinking is that level of precision is not that important (Our Coach Andrea generally thinks so as well) and if you agreed you could just connect both assioma and neo to our app and press -5% and make your warmups a little harder in general. At least you could just design your workouts normally. If your process does not bother you then it\u2019s not the end of the world as our editor is fast if you don\u2019t have a million workout variations Also I understand some people are just perfectionists or there are always \u201cit depends\u201d situations that precision is required. If you are doing a 2X20 then accuracy becomes more critical even if just from a mental perspective In my solution your completed line would be a bit above the blue target (target shows 150w and actual shows 160w) in our app but you could just use our app. You still might use the Garmin to record with at the same time to get it in GC but at least it would be secondary to watching our screen.

We are trying to retain and improve our simplicity but also solve problems such as this one that is why I like the automatic idea.\n\nPost 9 by zymurgy:\nThe issue on trainers like Stages SB20 is more the time it takes to get to target power rather than reducing. Obviously this is more of an issue on shorter duration intervals. So I found a 2 or 3 second period to pre-adjust would work well and would mean the time at target power was closer to the interval duration. For example the SB20 can take 5 plus seconds to get to power, it is not quite as slow dropping off. So by adding pre-adjustment of 3 seconds for a 60s interval I would be close to target for 58s, since it is likely still getting to the specified power once the interval has truly started. On prior KickR and Neo 2T per-adjust was less of an issue than the SB20. NOTE: the SB20 tends to jump part of the way towards target, then stagnate or even drop down then eventually reach target. So for example 135 to 380 watts often looks like 135 to perhaps 310 in a couple of seconds hangs around looking at it\u2019s reflection in a mirror and pontificating life for a few seconds then jumps closer to 380 watts\n\nPost 10 by Alex:\nOh I see, thanks for explaining, I will think about how hard it is to do it automatically vs settings. If we do it automatically we will take this into account and check both up and down times.\n\nPost 11 by zymurgy:\nI think having a user able to define a period in seconds and then let them decide whether to apply for decrease is probably as complicated as it need be\n\nPost 12 by Alex:\nBut the problem is most people don\u2019t look at or understand all these settings, so the reason I prefer automatic is everyone benefits from it regardless if they do settings or not. I used to think like you that everything could be a setting. Our app is simple (yet flexible) that is a big part of what makes it good for a wider group of people. Adding more and more settings makes it feel more complex and I spend more time explaining how things work\n\nPost 13 by zymurgy:\nI understand that working in a software company. Based on my personal indoor cycling experience with different trainers, I have only ever needed to specify a period for increase, most users would probably never need to set anything, but if someone had a sluggish trainer then that is handy. So by automatic would you look to somehow take into account the power reported from the trainer based on the power the app is specifying and varying the timing based on that. A capability like that would be interesting. Something else I wondered was whether an app could send more aggressive changes to some trainers than others, with the Stages SB20 needing a big boot up it\u2019s backside compared to a gentle nudge on a Neo 2T. For example, I have thought of manually amending workouts so the SB20 would get an initial prompt above the target for a second or two then a prompt at the target power for the rest of the interval.\n\nPost 14 by Alex:\nYes, looking at the time difference between target sent and how for actual power to be achieved. My testing was Neo was instant (so intervals come early in our app) and Wahoo is 2-3 seconds. I have paid attention in a few years but generally many people could benefit from this (I think). But it\u2019s more extreme cases like SB20 with big flywheel where it really matters. I would create a second request for this \u201cauto ramp\u201d feature other people have mentioned when they stop in the middle of a harder interval on some trainers getting started again is very hard. These are similar problems in my mind.",

The simplest is just to press slope mode and possibly shift gears or press + - to get to the intensity level you want. Now if you want to resume from where you were at you would need to just keep pedalling at low intensity, and reselect the same workout and it would merge them together and press skip a few times to get back to where you were at and press ERG again. Now this probably requires 5-10 clicks. We want to add the ability to insert a segment or interval set which would be closer to what you want and could probably do this in a couple clicks with less brain power required.\nSolution: Press slope mode and adjust intensity manually; future feature to insert segments.",

Even though the file has it, TrainerDay seems to not read the slope data. When I download a workout from trainerday that has slope data manually added from \u2018Create Workout\u2019 section, it does not show slope information in the file. Can you share a sample file which has slope data added that I can use as reference?\nUser Problem: TrainerDay not reading slope data from uploaded files.\nAnswer: None of these file formats support slope mode zwift is the closest with freeride but you can\u2019t specify the slope. I have not tried it with slopes but in the past designing in excel and copy paste to our app would be the only alternative. It should work. First create one in TD then copy paste that into excel from the UI then you should be able to work back and forth. So in this case you could create them in CSV and then to excel / copy paste\u2026\nSolution: Create a workout in TrainerDay, copy it to Excel, and then work back and forth.",

You can only do smart slopes in our training app. Smart slope workouts are especially perfect for short-intervals. On many smart-trainers ERG mode is not good for short- intervals. I think all trainers are bad for 5-second intervals in ERG mode. Science has shown that very short intervals can be a great minimalistic method of training.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0hGttUAsyWEYot4iW.png)\n\nSprinting in slope mode by shifting gears and increasing cadence makes it more like an outdoor sprint. Smart Slopes or automated slope mode allows the trainer to change slopes automatically, similar to Zwift except that you are programming the slopes. Slope workouts are very individual.\n\n**Slope mode workouts require practice.** Practice in creating the perfect workout and practice executing the workout. We will start creating a list of recommended slope workouts, but you will still need to perfect your gears and cadence to hit the targets. When you are creating workouts, you are setting the slope, but you are also setting the target power/percent. This target power is a visual representation of what you are trying to hit, but since you control the power output by changing gears and cadence, it\u2019s only a reference point.\n\n**Mixed slope and ERG mode.** If you have ever taken a 20-minute FTP test or 8-minute FTP test on most platforms, they go in and out of ERG and slope or resistance mode. You can design your own workouts to do exactly the same in TrainerDay. Any interval you can change to slope or erg just by clicking the switch in our app.\n\nSee our editor before on how to create slope workouts. You don\u2019t need to set slope in the interval type unless you want it to automatically change for you.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0pEOaLR0G1vagKEA9.png)\n\nTo use smart slopes you must have a premium account.\n\nIf you have a premium account now, you can start creating your first workout in our [workout creator.](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/create)\n\n[Upgrade Now](https://trainerday.com/pricing/)\n\n### A great example slope\u00a0workout\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0cymNak6fNn-586IU.png)\n\nHere is a [link to that workout](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/4-second-intervals)\n\n[https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/4-second-intervals](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/4-second-intervals)\n\nThis workout first increases slope right before the 4-second intervals. Then you should shift and increase cadence and go as hard as you can for 4-seconds.\n\nHere is a study showing this can be great for general fitness, but 4-second workouts can be fun when you need something else to do as well as bringing great sprinting benefits. **You must have a trainer that is capable of more watts than your 4-second limit.**\n\n[https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/fitness/four-second-interval-workouts-may-be-all-it-takes-to-maintain-fitness-and-strength-1.4654140](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/fitness/four-second-interval-workouts-may-be-all-it-takes-to-maintain-fitness-and-strength-1.4654140)",

        "text": "But it is not prefect either.\n\nPost 13 by Alex:\nI also like slope mode and it comes from the old compu-trainers I believe. The problem that I have seen is that when setting a target in resistance mode (and I assume slope mode is the same) it can\u2019t really be connected to watts. We could do it kind of like power match feature but that would be a bit of a mess and complicated. Meaning look at the target slope, read the current watts and then try to adjust the slope to get it to the watts. That would require some hunting around. I think a user would almost need to create special workouts just for this slope mode because each trainer and gearing would produce different watt outputs for specific slopes. So you could create a workout with a warmup of 1% slope, followed by a threshold 8% slope and back to a 1% slope for a cool down. Now that 8% slope would not actually be 100% of FTP it would just increase the resistance and get it in the ball park but the user creating the workout and doing the ride would have to fine tune this. Sadly although I like the idea this is getting uglier\u2026 I am still not apposed to it as I think it might be interesting and once we do slope mode might be easy to implement. I do like the training effect. I might personally use this instead of ERG for harder efforts. Alternatively maybe we could just imporve our slope mode with giant buttons to increase. Maybe two levels of buttons. + 5% or + 1%. Just the idea I mean Not real obviously image694\u00d7623 39.9 KB\n\nPost 14 by Alex:\nMaybe there is a way to estimate power. We have the formula to convert incline % + weight + power to speed. So we know how much power it takes to maintain a specific speed up a specific incline %. So a 30w increase in power would be approximately Y% for a new slope at the same speed. And if it is too much, you slow down\u2026 I think that might work\u2026\n\nPost 15 by HighSpeed:\nSounds good Alex. Slope mode as you describe it is really all that\u2019s needed. Give me slope resistance and I can do hard sprint intervals. That is what is missing with Erg mode. Determination of slope from %FTP will only be an estimate of possible watts because you can\u2019t be sure how fast I will pedal. The important part is to preserve the ratios for %FTP values in the workout. If 100% FTP maps to 10% slope, 50% FTP should map to 5% and 200% FTP should map to 20%. You can then use the -/+ controls to consistently scale the resistance level across the entire workout. Cheers!\n\nPost 16 by Alex:\nYes now you are thinking like me. Meaning that is the simple approach (50=5%\u2026). And have you tried our resistance mode (free-ride) and the problem is that the resistance mode is too flat and does not feel like slope mode? What trainer are you using now?\n\nPost 17 by HighSpeed:\nThis might help. Here is a workout I created on my NordicTrack bike. You define only \u201cincline%\u201d for each interval block. The bike then responds with a different calculated resistance force for each interval during the workout. While pedalling, you can modify the overall resistance using the +/- control that changes the relative resistance level for each interval . + makes each interval harder. - makes them easier. This means you can share a workout with riders with different strength levels. Each rider sees the same changes during the workout. They select their personal level of resistance with the -/+ control. nt3130\u00d7900 390 KB\n\nPost 18 by HighSpeed:\nMy trainer is the Stages SB20 Smart Bike.",

Marty\n\nPost 11 by Alex:\nI mean when using slope mode you shift with shifters on your bike. So there is zero delay other then the delay in your bike derailleurs, which should be fast or at least very predictable and fast enough (like outdoors). Just click on slope in our app, and go to like 2-3% slope with arrows at the bottom and test this with using the shifters on your bike. One you have verified this works, you can program automatic slope mode changes to change the slope angle (i.e. resistance) right before any hard intervals like I did in my example provided in that link.\n\nPost 12 by dthrog00:\nYou can also leave your gears alone and just set up a slope workout.

The power was less \u201cjumpy\u201d in both scenarios than it was in the screenshot from the first post, but the app still only controlled the power accurately within a ~15-20W band, resulting in the need to shift the bike to accommodate changes in power outside of that 15-20W band.

I\u2019m not sure if it is related to dual-recording on a Garmin Edge 530, and still need to run an experiment to see if the issues persist in the absence of dual-recording. I\u2019m documenting to see if anyone else has run into similar issues and may have some ideas on how to resolve. Thank you! Sometimes the trainer holds the target interval power after the interval has ended, such that the power does not decrease at all to match the rest interval target power. Sometimes the trainer is unable to hit the interval target power, by a wide margin (eg: target 378, actual avg 219). I experimented by changing from ERG to \u201cresistance mode\u201d and manually shifting to harder gears ~3 seconds before the start of an interval, and that did not resolve the issue. I suspect this issue may be related to the following problem. ERG mode is only able to control the trainer within a 15-20W band. For example, if the target wattage changes by 40W from one interval to the next, the trainer only changes ~15-20W even accounting for time to allow the trainer to ramp up (or down) to match the new target power. As a workaround, I need to manually shift 2-3 gears when encountering this situation, which defeats the purpose of ERG.\nContext: Running ERG workouts on Tacx Flux S with Garmin Edge 530.\nUser Problem: Trainer holds target power after intervals and struggles to hit target power.\nAnswer: Hi mklim, thanks for your detailed report. It sounds like you're experiencing some common issues with ERG mode on the Tacx Flux S. The behavior you're describing, where the trainer holds power after intervals and struggles to hit target power, can indeed be frustrating. It's important to ensure that the trainer is connected correctly to avoid control issues. Have you tried disconnecting the Garmin Edge and using the Tacx app directly? This can sometimes help with the control issues you're facing. Let me know how it goes!\nSolution: Disconnect Garmin Edge and use Tacx app directly.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Hello, I agree with MedTechCD that connecting trainer to two control devices (one with ANT+ second with BLE) is most common cause of loosing control issues - please confirm that this in not your case. Second issue usually is caused by limitation of trainer itself and can be solved by setting higher/lower gear on the bike. For third issue - could you please check if this improves with higher cadence? Br, Marek\nContext: Following up on mklim's issues with the Tacx Flux S.\nUser Problem: Loss of control issues with the trainer.\nAnswer: Thanks for your input, Marek. You're right that connecting to multiple devices can cause control issues. It's always best to connect the trainer as a sensor only. As for the gear settings and cadence, those are good suggestions to try and can often help with the power control issues.\nSolution: Connect trainer as a sensor only; adjust gear settings and cadence.",

I really like dynamic training, I like ERG for a lot of indoor training but I think it should be used in a more dynamic way. So what you are suggesting supports that. The problem is we are small so we need to prioritize things based on what seems that will benefit a larger audience. As this gets more popular or we get bigger it seems more possible.\nSolution: Prioritization based on audience benefit.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: I recently purchased the Zwift Ride frame and plan to use TrainerDay as my main application with it. It would be incredibly useful if the buttons on the frame could function as: Plus/Minus for HR+ Adjusting ERG intensity Modifying Slope. Since the Zwift Frame is equipped with the Zwift Cog, and there are no mechanical gears or cassette, implementing a form of virtual gear shifting would be a fantastic addition. Perhaps this could work as a control for Resistance? I\u2019m happy to assist with testing and provide more detailed suggestions as I spend more time using the frame. Let me know if I can help make this happen!\nContext: User is integrating TrainerDay with a new Zwift Ride frame.\nUser Problem: Need for button functionality on the Zwift Ride frame.\nAnswer: No direct response from Alex in this post.",

You seem to have done everything right. Offset means you pressed the up arrow (so the target was 1% but you added 1%). So it looks correct. It\u2019s been a while since I used this so it\u2019s slightly possible I am wrong about this offset but I will find someone to confirm. Other people use slope mode like and no one has said their is any issue. Try pressing down arrow one time for offset 0% and see if that works. But yes, I see the bug that the workout description is wrong in the app for slope mode.\nSolution: Try pressing down arrow one time for offset 0%.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I did a quick test setting the offset to 0% and that seems to make it work as expected.

So, my transition to smart trainer was effectively a campaign to replicate the 2-3 min rests & 15-25 sec all-out sprints. Others have noted that erg mode is not well-suited to this activity pattern, and I can confirm that. Although otherwise rather sparse, the Jetblack app has a specific resistance mode, and the resistance level can be set manually. I set the resistance to a low, constant level, used another app to set the ReHIT timing and recorded the 9+ min session. The experiment turned out pretty well; the power profiles looked pretty square with little over/undershoot at the transitions.

I mean, on the back end it\u2019s simple math (given each distinct trainer\u2019s max watts), but when sharing your status or workouts with others, using watts would be what you need. And if you want to compare to your old school oil resistance, you would need to use a power meter to compute the resistance watts in each gear. Then all your trainers and athletes can have meaningful conversations without having to factor in who\u2019s using what brand of trainer.\nUser Problem: Need for a standardized way to measure resistance across different trainers.\nAnswer: This makes sense. Yes why not just talk in terms of watts? For example \"I can generate 1,000 watts for 3 minutes\u2026 \" (I can\u2019t but\u2026 ) \u2026 then it is an apples to apples comparison especially when watts / kg are not so important. But you still don\u2019t really want to use ERG mode because you want to do it by feel (gears/cadence) so you need to know how to set the resistance (slope) up to a value that sets you up to be in the right gear at the right time, the good part is 5% grade should be similar on all trainers (never tested this). I believe a Tacx Neo takes into account your weight but I don\u2019t think most other trainers do. So this makes slope superior to resistance even though it is a bit less intutive as workout sharing should be possible across devices.\nSolution: Consider using watts for comparisons.",

Obviously this is not scientific, but just an opinion but after lots of reading and talking to people such as Andrea I believe it is likely.

Because it is based on slope mode you can ride the intervals at the intensity you want and really for as short or long as you want. It\u2019s a bit like a dumb trainer or even Zwift in non-ERG mode but you have visual guidance to help you hit your target intervals.

This workout idea was based on this article. irishtimes.com Four-second interval workouts may be all it takes to maintain fitness and...

solo rides do you want to increase your speed or improve your performance well the good news is that getting faster on your bike can be simply achieved by adhering to our four performance pillars keep watching because at the end of this video we offer a special bonus tip a cycling performance booster hi this is Alex from trainer day trainer day is an indoor outdoor training platform I work closely with Andrea Morelli Andrea is one of the top evidence-based cycling coaches in the world together we will bring you simple concise training advice optimizing your training volume is the first and most important pillar to improving your performance complex training plans and Magic workouts are unnecessary until you're approaching the limits of your personal performance Frank Overton of fast cat coaching is credited with being the pioneer of sweet spot and TSS based cycling in the following video clip Frank emphasizes that increase training volume alone is usually the key to your best seasonal performance and you know did you train more in 2019 than you did in 2018 if you did I bet you had a better season this would suggest that Frank also believes that volume is a more critical Factor than specific workouts or plans we would add to that and say that the right volume at the right time will usually provide you with your best results so what does the right volume at the right time mean it means rearranging your yearly cycling hours by decreasing at certain points in time and increasing others can yield substantially better results even if you're a time crunch cyclist pillar number two consistency it's optimal to have very consistent weekly patterns in your training volume if you're like me this may not happen if you have an incredibly busy week instead of your planned workouts you could fill it in with some very short indoor workouts evidence shows that 10 minute hit or Tabata session 20 minutes including a warm-up can augment your training gaps number three recovery performance gains happen during your recovery periods sleep is the most important method of recovery if you don't sleep at least eight hours a night eight plus being ideal start by turning off any screens an hour before your desired bedtime you can also try the weight lifter secret of taking zma zma contains the vitamin zinc and magnesium it's healthy and it works and it does not create the groggy morning feeling like melatonin if you train consistently patterns of daily weekly monthly and yearly recovery have been the gold standard for many decades for maximizing results taking a day or more off each week a week or more off each month and a few weeks off each year as well as a base period each season will give your body the rest it needs to increase to the next level if you have been cycling consistently and eating well but flatlined in your performance not having the right recovery pattern is probably the reason our fourth and final pillar is about workouts evidence suggests that if you are training six hours a week or more spend most of your time following low heart rate easy rides the start of your season could be all easy rides and slowly as your season progresses you increase the intensity for many cyclists going easy is more difficult than going hard getting fast requires self-control your harder workouts don't need to be complex and you don't need to kill yourself but you will see benefit from following a progressive overload pattern this means slowly and systematically increasing either your intensity your duration or both as Dr Seiler of polarized training points out hard efforts don't need to be incredibly hard and should be sustainable we take that a little further and suggest that you can start with easy intervals and build to hard intervals the polarized Studies have also proven that lower intensity weeks can beat higher intensity weeks so be very careful when you're trying to substitute intensity for volume for most cyclists the most important overload is regarding a weekly long ride you should try to fit in a long ride each week and start small and continually build the duration to your maximum occurring around a month before any event we feel that software platforms and many coaches have put too much emphasis on highly structured training that we also agree that simple moderate sustainable intervals will add horsepower to your already volume-based aerobic engine Outdoors Hills are a great place to do workouts either hill repeats or longer Hills can be Optimum higher intensity intervals and Hill training is most important as you get closer to your peak season ideally this follows a pattern of progressive overload as well and for our bonus tip popular and pro cycling in recent years during your peak season add full effort intervals this means pushing yourself to the maximum for two to",

        "text": "They are perfect for long distances. The type II fibres can be devided into type IIa and type IIb. The type IIb fibres are dedicated to pure sprinting. Very explosive and excellent for very short durations at high power. The fibres I just explained are trainable within their functions and also define the baseline of the athlete. So Usain bolt has dominated the world 100m sprint for years simply because he has a lot of type IIb muscle fibers. Same as Tadej Pogacar has a lot of type I fibres. So, for these fibres your genetics lay the base foundation and you can only get so much better by training them specifically. The interesting part are the type IIa fibres. These fibres are anaerobic by nature. So high power output, but not as explosive as a sprint. Think powerzone 6. With training however, you can use these for endurance too. So, when your focus is completely on high intensity, these fibres will be highly anaerobic, making you a puncheur/ sprinter. When you focus is endurance only, these fibres will enhance your abillity to do longer rides. In your schedule there are a few things that (could) play part in your result. The focus to do sprint training. What you train is what you get. I hope you understand this principle better. Want more endurance? You will need to train more endurance. Slow zone 2 trainingsessions. A lot of races. Racing every week is not a training. Race will drain you and most of the time they will overload our body too much. A regular training asks for a 6 - 48 hour recovery period, with 48 hours being the exception. A race usually needs at least 48 hours of recovery. So if you are doing two races every week it means that you will need 4 days of rest to recover from that. Together with the two days that you are racing on, you are left with one day of serious focussed training. You can do some recovery rides, but I hope you see that two races every week is not a recipe for better results. Finally the duration of your training sessions. Since your focus seems to be racing on Zwift, you don\u2019t really need long trainingsessions. However a proper zone 2 training for an athlete like you will take at least 2 to 3 hours. There might be a nutrition part in this too, but let\u2019s not get in too deep. First focus on the right training plan. My advice would be to choose a few (max once a month) races where you really want to be at your best. If the competition is more seasonal, only in spring for instance, that would be more difficult, but racing is draining and demanding. Build a program of two High intensity sessions per week. The rest of the week are easy, zone 2 trainings. You could use the polarised training program from coach Jack. You could even use the custom traininigs in the program. Do vo2 max and threshold. Make an effort to free up time to do one longer zone 2 session each week. This will make your baseline so much better. Have lots of fun training and racing\nSolution: Focus on endurance training with a mix of high intensity and zone 2 sessions.",

You can only do smart slopes in our training app. Smart slope workouts are especially perfect for short-intervals. On many smart-trainers ERG mode is not good for short- intervals. I think all trainers are bad for 5-second intervals in ERG mode. Science has shown that very short intervals can be a great minimalistic method of training.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0hGttUAsyWEYot4iW.png)\n\nSprinting in slope mode by shifting gears and increasing cadence makes it more like an outdoor sprint. Smart Slopes or automated slope mode allows the trainer to change slopes automatically, similar to Zwift except that you are programming the slopes. Slope workouts are very individual.\n\n**Slope mode workouts require practice.** Practice in creating the perfect workout and practice executing the workout. We will start creating a list of recommended slope workouts, but you will still need to perfect your gears and cadence to hit the targets. When you are creating workouts, you are setting the slope, but you are also setting the target power/percent. This target power is a visual representation of what you are trying to hit, but since you control the power output by changing gears and cadence, it\u2019s only a reference point.\n\n**Mixed slope and ERG mode.** If you have ever taken a 20-minute FTP test or 8-minute FTP test on most platforms, they go in and out of ERG and slope or resistance mode.

        "text": "Most of us are amateurs without very specific goals. We want to feel good about what we do. There are a lot of ways to accomplish this and it also depends on what you need to feel good. I just got back from the North of France. I\u2019m a strong, explosive guy, so I suck at riding mountains. But I love it. So whenever I get the chance to go up, I will. To give you a more detailed picture. On holidays I ride every other day. Because I also want to spend quality time with my family. So, Over the last 3 weeks, I did about 10.000 altitude meters and 750km, and I gained about 1,3 kg of muscle mass with no weight or core training. I\u2019m like an elegant who wants to be a ballerina. But I love cycling in the mountains. So it is not about the next KOM, but I love climbing and enjoying the view. I love to look at the tiny dots in the valley and realize that\u2019s where I came from. And I did that with my two legs. Oh, and I really love to descend. That\u2019s a very nice reward. In general moving is good for your body and mind. Building a solid body/base to do this with is a beginning. After this you can make your training more specific if you want to. Just keep in mind where the fun is in what you do. That is the way you will still be doing this when you get older.",

I\u2019m starting to put my ATP together, with a A-event on June (end of the month). I\u2019ve quantified TSS for my strength workouts (upper and lower) using Joe Friel\u2019s method, but I\u2019m really thinking on using only lower body workouts TSS data to enter on my calendar, since upper body TSS data can somehow give a wrong impression on real form/fatigue numbers on the bike. Can you give me your feedback on this? Thanks.\nContext: User is planning a training schedule and is concerned about TSS data.\nUser Problem: Confusion about how to accurately track TSS for upper and lower body workouts.\nAnswer: Hi Snaavt, Sounds like you\u2019re creating a good plan. I Like where you are going with that A-race. I\u2019m a big fan of Joe, too. However, I found that I was already coaching many of the same principles when I discovered him. I interviewed him once when one of his books was published. Nice guy. I wouldn\u2019t split up the TSS. Any workout has an impact on your body. Leaving out these work-outs gives you the wrong impression of your total load. I don\u2019t know what kind of work you are doing, but let\u2019s create two versions of you. One version works as a paver, working five days a week. The other version of you works 3 days a week as a librarian. Which job will give you the best opportunity to be the best cyclist you can be? As a full-time paver, you will have less time to train, and your weekly load is much higher before you even get onto your bike. Every load on your body needs time to recover. Yesterday, I rode 100km on my gravel bike to my family for Christmas. At a speed of 29km/h, it was a moderately heavy ride. The reason I feel it today is because I have been sitting on a crappy folding chair the whole evening instead of lying on the couch doing nothing. Everything you do has an impact on the end result. If you are working with a good plan, the way you have set it up now, all those details matter. Let every workout count for TSS and fatigue. As a fan of Joe, you are probably planning to use a log. You could simply give the TSS from your (upper body) strength training a different color. This way, you are not ignoring it in your weekly load, but you can pick it out easily. Have a great day, Coach Robert\nSolution: Recommended not to split TSS and suggested a color-coding system for tracking.\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: Thank you so much for your input!

Mountainbike Marathons are the ultimate nightmare. They are long, so you need endurance, but they also have many steep, technical climbs that require skill and strength. The rule of training is simple: use it or lose it. This means that a block of strength training from November until January will give you great power in February, but that power will fade away during the season. Since you have time to do weight training, I would extend that period. Start with 5-second reps. Do all your exercises after each other. Pik a weight you can use to do 8-10 reps. Do 5 seconds up, 5 seconds down. As may reps as you can, but no more than 10. If you can do more, pick a heavier weight. After one set, go to the next exercise. Do one round, maybe a second if you can. Do this for 6 weeks. Ideally, you would follow your Trainer Day schedule of 3 weeks of work and 1 week of rest. No weight training during rest week. For the next 6 weeks, you make exploding reps up and three reps down. do 3 sets of each exercise and pick a weight you can do 12-15 reps with. Again, follow your rest routine from your Trainer Day schedule. For the rest of the season, do 4 or 5 sets of 25 to 35 reps per exercise. Pick different exercise every 6 weeks. And don\u2019t forget to take weeks of, as in your Trainer Day schedule. Again, weight training gives you way better results for strength than bike training. You will develop all the muscles in your body, fatigue less, and develop stamina and power. Don\u2019t worry about your bike training. Do what you did last year. Do the intervals and a heap of zone 2, and you will have a great season.\n\nPost 9 by Trx:\nI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t understand what you mean by five uphill and five downhill.\n\nPost 10 by Trx:\nSo I just have the doubt of which training to follow by bike with Trainar Day,\u2026 So far I\u2019ve entered a specific date with Jach and followed the workouts, but this year I wanted to do more specific things that are tailored to my goals. I\u2019m undecided whether to start now with a base block or directly go to the Italian serius or stronger ride blocks. From November to January, along with my bike workouts, I wanted to do weights two times a week and then go to 1 time. My biggest doubt is which of the training blocks that Jacks has proposed during this period. Do you think that during this period I carry out 2 days of weights and 2 days of bikes is fine?\n\nPost 11 by Alex:\nThe most traditional for max bike performance would be to do Base + Lots of Strength Build + maintenance strength Peak with reduced strength or none So yes more strength from Nov - Early Jan during.",

        "text": "With aerobic training you can gain benefit from low intensity (zone 2) training and all the zones above that. The benefits from each zone vary and if you follow more modern cycle training approaches, you\u2019ll spend most of your time in the lower zones, with small dosed amounts in the higher zones (e.g. Seiler\u2019s 80:20 approach). Weight and strength training doesn\u2019t work that way. The weight training equivalent of cycling\u2019s lower intensity zones is working a muscle, or muscle group, to less than failure. While you get lots of benefit from that approach in cycling / aerobic training, it does pretty much nothing for you when weight training. Weight and strength training is a much more digital stress / response situation. If the stressor isn\u2019t strong enough you won\u2019t get a response (increased strength). In that respect weight and strength training is like going out in the sun. You can go out all day in the winter sun in the Northern Hemisphere and you\u2019ll not develop a sun tan - the stressor (UV levels) aren\u2019t strong enough to provoke a response (tanning). But in the peak of summer near the equator, 10 minutes in the sun would be a strong enough stressor to provoke a strong tanning response (in caucasian\u2019s like myself anyway!) And that\u2019s the key with weight training - you need to provide a strong enough stressor to provoke the strength gaining response. And just like sun exposure there\u2019s also an intensity / duration interaction. A UV stressor strong enough to provoke a tan will also burn you if you stay out too long in it. So it is with weight training. If you\u2019re training hard enough to provoke a strength gaining response, then you can\u2019t endure (at any age) much training like that. You\u2019ll over-train extremely rapidly (unless you\u2019re using chemical support but that\u2019s not something I\u2019ve personal experience of). OK, so how does that all translate into my (personal) training. My once a week training looks like the following: I first train the core of my torso: 2 sets of pulldowns (hitting the lats, biceps and so on). 2 sets of chest press / bench press. 2 sets of shoulder press. I then move onto my lower body. 2 sets of leg presses (I\u2019d prefer squats but mechanically I\u2019m not suited to those - lower back issues). I finish off with my arms: 2 sets of dumbell curls. 2 sets of triceps pushdowns. And that\u2019s it. Once a week, 12 sets in total. Doesn\u2019t look like a lot does it? But if you\u2019re working with proper intensity most people can\u2019t do much more than that. So what do I mean by intensity in a strength context? Simply going to muscular failure. And that\u2019s difficult to do! So let me illustrate what that looks like with a biceps curl that most people know. You start with a weight at the bottom of the curl and take a slow 10 seconds to raise the weight. No cheating, no body lunging etc. At the top of the arc you stop a little short so that the biceps can\u2019t relax and remains under tension. You pause for 2 seconds. Then you lower for 10 seconds.",

This is doing 5 reps with about your 7 rep max, so not to failure.

Kettlebell swing Weighted pushups getting progressively harder (aiming for 5X with 7RM intensity) Pull ups I think for most people, especially wanting to do the minimum, you don\u2019t need to do auxiliary exercises like biceps or triceps focus. You will get plenty from bench and pull up. I also would love to hear what you are doing.

(And my apologies if much of my response is too simplistic - I rarely come across people who are familiar with Arthur Jones and similar approaches, hence why I often have to start with a very basic description of what high intensity strength training is!) I\u2019d agree with most of what you\u2019ve written. Except in my case I can say that the routine I mention below is actually increasing, not just maintaining my strength. Not beyond the levels I had when I was 18 - that\u2019s not going to be possible at my age - but pretty close to it. And my wife started training this way at the beginning of the year. She\u2019s the same age as me, 55, fit (aerobically and from yoga) but has never done any strength training. And her strength is increasing still, 11 or so months in, on the same 1 day a week weight training routine. Like myself no one\u2019s ever going to mistake her for a bodybuilder, but that\u2019s not her or my objective. We\u2019re simply trying to stay healthy and active and adding this into the cycling mix. Anyway, here\u2019s what I\u2019d just written to Sceva\u2026 Hi Sceva, Sure, my pleasure. Weight training differs from cycle (aerobic) training in one key aspect that has a major bearing on how you should train. With aerobic training you can gain benefit from low intensity (zone 2) training and all the zones above that. The benefits from each zone vary and if you follow more modern cycle training approaches, you\u2019ll spend most of your time in the lower zones, with small dosed amounts in the higher zones (e.g. Seiler\u2019s 80:20 approach).

The way to do strength training varies. You can do strength training on the bike, weight training or body weight training. They all have their benefits and limitations. I advise my clients to do basic bike time divided over at least three workouts. During the base period, I plan some strength training on the bike. The advantage is that the time spent on the bike is good. The disadvantage is that only a limited number of muscles will be developed and only to a certain strength. Your core muscles, for instance, contribute to your performance but are not really getting any training when you\u2019re on the bike, especially not on a road bike. Taking your training to the gym to do some serious weight training is an excellent way to get stronger, provided that it doesn\u2019t compromise your bike time and that you are motivated to do so. I don\u2019t like going to the gym, but I see the results on the bike, and that keeps me motivated. My advice: if you hate going to the gym, don\u2019t do it. You won\u2019t see the results, but you won\u2019t be bored out, either. A simple and very effective way is to do bodyweight training. Using Tabata-style training, you can easily add 2 or 3 extra workouts in your week, and it will only cost you minutes. This might sound like it isn\u2019t worth the effort, but believe me, it is the smallest investment with huge returns. Think about it. You don\u2019t waste any time going to the gym, no long training sessions, no equipment needed, little recovery time. I do this kind of training when I roll out of bed on the bedroom floor.

I think there is not much strength training on the bike you can do. Studies show that this kind of training is very limited in effectiveness. On the other side, most intervals will make sure you get stronger on the bike. Here are some examples: 5 minute sweet spot intervals on a two hour training. 3 minute zone 4 intervals with 3 minutes rest. every zone 5 and zone 6 training. Every hill or mountain climb My advice is to do these kind of trainings. Forget about strength training on the bike. These trainings will all make you stronger anyway. My clients have three trainings: 1 zone 5 or 6 training 1 zone 4 training 1 zone 2 training If they want to train more than three times a week I let them choose the third training. It can be sweet spot, zone 2 or a fartlek training. Meaning you don\u2019t have a schedule but you train as the route gives you your obstacles.",

Here are some examples: 5 minute sweet spot intervals on a two hour training. 3 minute zone 4 intervals with 3 minutes rest. every zone 5 and zone 6 training. Every hill or mountain climb My advice is to do these kind of trainings. Forget about strength training on the bike. These trainings will all make you stronger anyway. My clients have three trainings: 1 zone 5 or 6 training 1 zone 4 training 1 zone 2 training If they want to train more than three times a week I let them choose the third training. It can be sweet spot, zone 2 or a fartlek training. Meaning you don\u2019t have a schedule but you train as the route gives you your obstacles. Any mountain bike route is a fartlek-style training. You go up, down, over rocks, through a creek, etc. The freedom of choice is important so you don\u2019t get \u201ccramped\u201d by following a schedule all the time. There are only a few riders that follow a schedule to the end year in, year out. Do you make your weight training seasonal? I mean do you adapt your weight training the different stages in your season and/ or schedule? With weights, you can follow a base, build, and peak routine too.\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nOur SFR and Dynamic force workouts are lower RPM, high force workouts which result in strength endurance not just strength. Strength is done with weight training as Robert suggested. Strength endurance is something that most people don\u2019t training and SFR and Dynamic force are interesting if you have not done them. Let me know if you need more info.\n\nPost 6 by Trx:\nSo thank you both. Unfortunately, with the translator, I cannot understand your speeches. I have already followed the SFRs and the dynamic strength exercises that Pripone Jacks. Every year from November until January I do both bodyweight and weight training and I always felt good. In fact, Robert is right, but this year I wanted to insist more on strength and since I use trainer day as my only source of training I wanted to like do a training of about 16 weeks with Jakcs something to put together with the weights in this period. Unfortunately also the fault of the English language of the descriptions I wanted a piece of advice on which blocks to use type Among those proposed on the site type the serius italian,crunched power ecc ecc .Or better still use the custom block and insert the most suitable exercises for strength during this period. I repeat the translator is not on my side so excuse me for the mistakes.\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nYou should paste our responses into ChatGPT and ask it to translate, it is a much better translator. If you have done SFR then I don\u2019t know of any other good bike strength work. Riding your MTB up steep hills\u2026 You should think in terms of what you are trying to do. On the bike you should be thinking power duration curve or mean max power (MMP). Each person will have a power signature, some will be sprinters and some will be TTers. When it comes to anaerobic work capacity it\u2019s difficult to make a huge change in this other than 8-12 weeks of hard efforts and you reach your peak. The best thing you can do is raise your aerobic capacity so you don\u2019t have to push so hard. Raise your base and then your anaerobic power above that is raised as well.\n\nPost 8 by Robert_UCL:\nAlex makes a good point: Look at what you need in your marathon and your strengths as a cyclist. Mountainbike Marathons are the ultimate nightmare.",

Elaine LaLaine, the now 97 year old wife of Jack LaLaine, he being one of the greatest fitness guys of all time. At 97 she trains 7 days a week. She has a core message \u201cAlways stay positive!!!\u201d Here is ChatGPT summary since that might be paywalled At 97, Elaine LaLanne, the \u201cFirst Lady of Fitness,\u201d continues to shape the fitness industry and is a model for aging well. She was the wife and business partner of Jack LaLanne, renowned as the father of modern fitness. While Jack was the face of the fitness movement, Elaine preferred to work behind the scenes. Elaine has also published books and is working on film projects about their life and contributions to fitness, with Mark Wahlberg attached to play Jack. She remains active in fitness circles, providing counsel to industry professionals and continuing her fitness routines, which she says have not only kept her physically active but also mentally sharp. Despite facing personal tragedies, including the loss of her daughter, Elaine maintains a positive outlook and remains a testament to the benefits of a lifetime of exercise, positive thinking, and healthy living. She continues to inspire many by showing the value of maintaining an active lifestyle and the impact of exercise on aging, emphasizing the importance of movement: \u201cIf you don\u2019t move, you become immovable.\u201d Can I do it? So I am learning some tricks, and first indication is I feel they might work. I will keep sharing those tricks here. So this discussion is mostly about consistency and strength training. I really want to get into sharing the importance of strength training for cyclists. Many cyclists don\u2019t like strength training. I am not going to try to argue that it is critical to short or medium term performance, as that is fairly unproven. I still do think it is very important even in very small amounts. Could be as little as 15 minutes a week. My New Primary Tricks Positivity from myself and everyone in my life about training \u201cyou look sexy.\u201d No negative statements and full support for partners and family about exercise. My wife agrees but still struggles not to disrupt me Do what ever it takes to get motivated, even if that means eating something that does not fully align with your diet Realize strength training is the most important thing in MY life. There is likely nothing you can do to improve your health span more, and you can spend minimal amounts of time so it\u2019s not going to disrupt your life. Nothing should ever come before this other than extreme emergencies and illnesses. It can be 15 minutes twice a week. Make it happen!!! This does not need to be an argument about the importance of strength training. It\u2019s more just my current mindset. If you believe in the benefit of strength training than Zone 2 is the perfect compliment of strength training. Too many hard efforts on the bike can disrupt your strength training. Again we are a cycling platform. I think cycling is absolutely great and not trying to down play the importance of aerobic exercise. I am just trying to get people to consider having more of a balance and put health first which Andrea and I both believe will bring maximum performance at any level of cyclist.",

        "text": "EDT will give you a totally different perspective on this matter. With slow you are focused on time under tension. This means 50kg = 50kg but for 5-6 seconds most likely. If you raise 50kg fast enough it can be 75kg of force or more but time under tension will be less at least on the positive direction. Also it seems intense/slow negatives are what make your muscles sore. The value of this is debatable. Meaning you don\u2019t need to get very sore to get strong. It\u2019s all super interesting and seems like science (some of it is, like faster is higher pressure/weight) but in the end it\u2019s finding what works for you. I would normally recommend against machines (unless it drives consistency) but it sounds like it is working for you which is great. I don\u2019t know your back problems but when I did leg press I had back problems and with good form squats (I was always afraid of) my back is excellent now. Deadlifts would be similar to low bar squatting to giving and incredible back.",

        "text": "So, how do you make strength training enjoyable? Well, I started weight training at around age 16, long before taking up running or getting on a bike. Growing up in a rough area in the UK, being small and lightly built, I took up weight training to try and gain some bulk. I tried pretty much everything - bar chemical enhancers like steroids - to gain size. 6 days a week. 2 workouts a day etc. And unfortunately for me, I discovered that I had a very limited capacity to gain weight, strength and muscle. After 2 years of consistent training, with the hormonal advantages that a 16-18 year old male has, I\u2019d only gained around 7 lbs of lean muscle, with the associated strength gains. Then at age 18, I came across Arthur Jones\u2019 Hi Intensity weight training philosophy. I found it hard to believe that it would work - brief, intense sessions - given that it was so different from any routine I\u2019d read about, but I gave it a go. And boy did it work! I was spending waaay less time in the gym, but working harder. And in the first 10 weeks of using the approach I gained strength at a rate that I couldn\u2019t believe and put on more muscle in 10 weeks than during my previous 2 years of training. I still use those approaches today, 40 years later. The reason I\u2019m mentioning this is that those approaches dovetail very well with cycling. I only need to do 1 weights session a week, of duration around 40 minutes, to gain as much strength and muscle as I\u2019m able to at age 55. I could do 2 or 3 such weight training sessions a week, but my 55 year old body wouldn\u2019t gain more strength or muscle as my hormonal system wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with that level of strength training. It\u2019s much, much easier to motivate myself to do 1 weights session a week, of that short duration, than trying to do multiple sessions and fit those around 2 or 3 bike rides a week. The book Body by Science by McGuff, while a little dry as a read, gives a good overview of once per week training. That might work for you as well and as I say, it fits very well around cycle training and most of us can find 40 minutes once a week to weight train, so motivation becomes less of an issue.\n\nPost 15 by Sceva:\n@DrJulesG1 - could you describe what your weekly weight session looks like? This intrigues me. Thanks.\n\nPost 16 by Alex:\nInteresting, I just searched this Aurthor Jones (I remembered the name but forgot who he was), and yes when I had a coach, that is exactly the style he was teaching and for sure I gained and got strong. 10 reps, slow and smooth and failure of one good set. Looking back, I now believe the two factors played the most important role were training very hard and very consistent. I got to the point I could do 10X at 4 second negatives of 45 degree leg press with 400kg. My leg press was one of the strongest in a gym with some real strong guys. I could not agree with you more than 1 day a week of the right strength training is perfect for a busy cyclist and most people could get plenty strong enough with this approach.",

These indoor trainers don\u2019t measure power on their own, and you\u2019ll have to focus on your own effort to hit target wattages, or simulate riding up or down hills.\n\nYou can connect to external apps while riding a dumb trainer, but it won\u2019t be the trainer itself that is doing the connecting. Instead, you will need an external power meter (pedals, crank arm, or bottom bracket), a speed sensor, or a cadence sensor. If you choose to go with one of the latter two options, you won\u2019t actually be measuring your power in the app, but rather estimating your speed based on the sensor data.\n\nAs you could probably guess, dumb trainers cannot be controlled by external apps. Thus, you\u2019ll never get the feeling of riding up or down hills on a dumb trainer, you\u2019ll just have to shift gears instead.\u00a0  \nFor experienced indoor riders looking to simulate real-life riding, perform ERG mode workouts, or train or race competitively, we recommend a smart trainer for that extra level of overall capability.\n\nBeginner indoor riders can certainly start with a dumb trainer which is much cheaper than any smart trainer. You will still be able to perform intervals and change the resistance, but now it\u2019s up to you instead of the app.\n\nWritten by Zach Nehr",

Is there a known way to do it? Regards.\nContext: User successfully installed the app but is facing issues with controlling resistance and incline.\nUser Problem: Inability to control resistance and incline during workouts.\nAnswer: The standard protocol is FTMS for controlling trainers and FEC is secondary old standard and it does not appear to support either of these so sorry to say our app can\u2019t control it.\nSolution: The app cannot control the resistance and incline due to protocol limitations.",

Should I start with the fitness plan? please advice.\nUser Problem: unable to complete any plan my garmin recommends\nAnswer: I agree with PedalMonkey. You are not weaker than the weekest plan. If you are just starting it is a good idea to just stay in zone 2 for a while and watch netflix and listen to music. You can add small amounts of intensity as you feel like it. You could do Base+ or Base++ for example. Also if things feel too hard lower your FTP. Press the - button when it is feeling too hard and as he pointed out if you are doing stuff over 100% then make sure you use + - or switch to slope mode to go at what feels right. If it is over 100% it should feel hard but you don\u2019t need to kill yourself.\nSolution: Stay in zone 2, lower FTP if needed, use + - or slope mode.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: thanks everyone for your replies. just to clarify on some points you\u2019ve brougt up erg - im using ERG, but i dont know anything about it. should i take any special considerations? shouldnt i use it? ftp - i got my ftp from the garmin estimation, not even an ftp test. ive been riding for just 2 months and it gave me a 207. is this a crazy number? plans - is there anywhere i can check what each plan is suppossed to do?it would be really helpful. bonus points: is time crunched inspired by the book the time crunched cyclist? i read it and right now i cannot even complete the test they recommend i am time crunched by the way.\nUser Problem: confusion about using ERG and FTP estimation\nAnswer: 207 would be high for most guys at 2 months. If you have not been doing any other endurance training it would seem unlikely to be that high. Because you are using ERG, I assume you have a smart trainer so Garmin should be semi-accurate. So sounds strange. Maybe you are bigger and in your 20s or 30s? Or maybe Garmin just made a mistake. Or you are not weak at all!!! All plans do the same thing Make you stronger and faster\u2026 How many hours a week does time-crunched mean to you? Really any of the coach jack plans are fine. We like Serious Italian the best for anyone doing 6+ hours a week.\nSolution: Consider the accuracy of Garmin, evaluate your training hours.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: just fyi in your test i got 120. im training with those numbers and its going well. thanks!\nAnswer: Great to hear. Yes that sounds reasonable. Thanks for the update.\nSolution: None",

I have finally got my direct drive turned in and the bike is mounted. What\u2019s the easiest way to test to make sure everything is working? Is it just a case of going to 'quick start\" and upping the watts? Thanks! Sorry for the basic questions I\u2019m very new to this!\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nCongratulations. Yes that\u2019s fine, do a ramp test some time to get you ftp as well.\n\nPost 3 by DMH:\nAwesome I saw those ramp tests. Will they just tell me my new ftp afterwards? Then I can set that in the settings?\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nIt will automatically update the settings for you. One thing to make sure is if you are a strong rider, meaning you have been riding regularly for a while, you might want to set your initial FTP to 200 or the ramp test will be too easy.\n\nPost 5 by DMH:\nAmazing! Thanks I\u2019m pretty new to this so I\u2019ll probably set it to like 100 and see what happens!",

My testing was Neo was instant (so intervals come early in our app) and Wahoo is 2-3 seconds. I have paid attention in a few years but generally many people could benefit from this (I think). But it\u2019s more extreme cases like SB20 with big flywheel where it really matters. I would create a second request for this \u201cauto ramp\u201d feature other people have mentioned when they stop in the middle of a harder interval on some trainers getting started again is very hard. These are similar problems in my mind.\n\nPost 15 by zymurgy:\nThe auto ramp would be a great addition, I know Kickr V6 and the Elite Justo have that feature, but it would be useful having it within an App for those using other trainers.",

        "text": "Forum Q&A: Editing a workout\nCategory: Workout Creation\nTopic Type: Training Execution\n\nQ&A 1:\nQuestion: I am new to TrainerDay, and like the ease of creating a workout, then quickly using it. It is a great complementary application to my training. I like to use progressions in my training over time. For example: a four x five minute block with two minutes of rest will be changed to a one minute rest. Once adapted to it, I will add another block of five minutes. I see there is an ability to add time, 10 seconds, to an interval, or increase/decrease power. What I am looking for is the ability to modify a workout, that I have created. I may be missing it, but once saved, except for what I mentioned above, I cannot find a more robust means to modify my workout, and re-save with changes. Such as reopening the workout in workout creation mode where I make a few modifications and get back to training. I am trying to avoid creating multiple workouts for with slight structural changes, like an added interval, or changing the finish of a workout. Thanks\nContext: User is new to TrainerDay and is looking for ways to modify workouts.\nUser Problem: Cannot find a robust means to modify saved workouts.\nAnswer: I assume you mean this? image2864\u00d71298 360 KB\nSolution: Clarification on the edit function.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thank you for the quick reply Yes\u2026that would be one workout IMG_1349828\u00d71792 115 KB IMG_1350828\u00d71792 86.8 KB I tried to upload two other screenshots, and that did seem to work. One was a 5 x 5\u2019 workout with 1\u2019 rest between. That was a workout I did today. Today, I did it with Z2 watts. If I was to that workout with sweet spot watts at this time of the year, I may want to increase the rest to 3 minutes. If I used Z2 watts again, I would use 8\u2019 blocks, which would increase the length of the workout at the same time. Ideally, if under an \u201cedit mode\u201d it brought me back to the original creation screen on the web application, I could quickly make my edits, save the changes, and get to work. I may be asking too much. In a usual week, I train intervals on Tuesday and Thursday. One day use short intervals, the other day is long intervals. I was hoping to have a workout template for each day. Modify it as appropriate for the time of season, or area of training I am focusing on, like 5 x 5\u2019s. I believe more experienced riders train this way. Plus, it saves on storage Just trying to keep it simple. Nothing fancy. Over the years I find simple works best. I do look at other workouts for ideas, and like the search capabilities of TrainerDay. Hopefully, this explains my question better!\nContext: User elaborates on their training routine and needs.\nUser Problem: Wants to modify workouts easily without creating multiple versions.\nAnswer: As R2Tom points out edit mode let\u2019s you edit it with original data. So I am confused. But maybe you are saying you would like to be able to edit in the app or at least click edit in the mobile app and open the web app? My guess is this would save about 10 seconds of time but maybe I am not understanding. Or maybe this 10-seconds is important\nSolution: Clarification on the user's needs regarding editing.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: @Alex BTW, we spoke once about editing a workout straight in calendar, any plans on it? My typical routine is that I copy a whole week in TP, paste it to the next and modify them exactly as @Oldmanbiker described. At TD I need to copy workouts, modify and paste new versions of them which takes longer. Rigid training plan is kinda inflexible.\nContext: User is asking about future features related to editing workouts in the calendar.\nUser Problem: Current process of modifying workouts is time-consuming.\nAnswer: Sorry some how this fell off my radar. That seems like a pretty reasonable request. What is the source of these workouts? Ones you create yourself, or clone from others or coach jack?\nSolution: Asking for more details on the user's workflow.",

Yours is more obvious and now we think we have it.\n\nPost 12 by potsiea1:\nNot wanting to go off track, but when you say you \u201cadded an ERG block\u201d mid workout, is that opening another workout and merging it? I haven\u2019t tried that yet, and it sounds useful.\n\nPost 13 by Alex:\nYou can definitely do that. Mid workout you can merge in any other workout. You can create groups of blocks to create workouts on the fly. I was not clearly understanding what he meant though.\n\nPost 14 by Sport_IT_Diederik:\nBesides the HR based mode, this is another incredible feature of the app. I\u2019m no longer doing \u201cpre-structured\u201d work-outs. Boring I\"m starting with a rough idea what I want to do and I adjust according to the mood (ok, and the feeling). An example : after a warmup in Z2, I do a 20 minutes sweet spot training, using HR. I take a couple of minutes of rest and do a HIIT ERG based interval block (or 2). I finish with another 10 minutes of SST and do a cooldown.\n\nPost 15 by Alex:\nI love dynamic training!!!

This second method sounds like a lot of steps but can be done in 20-30 seconds once you get it down.

Send 160W iso 150W. Keep that change behind the screens. Target displayed remains 150W. Recorded value is the one from the smarttrainer and needs to be reduced by the offset value. With regards to PowerMatch: Do not allow automatic PowerMatch when Offset mode is active. After all, if the user knows that the difference between smarttrainer and Power meter can be mathematically described, you don\u2019t need PowerMatch TrainerRoad has been doing this for years. You toggle PowerMatch between \u2018auto\u2019 or \u2018manual\u2019. Manual being an offset described by a formula.

For example when switching to HR mode we use averages from the previous modes. Also this should work for slope mode too. It will cause bugs and have a tail of extra development. I am a software developer / manager for 30+ years so I can usually smell when things will grow (and other times I am an optimist and fail to see it).

Ever since you rolled out the slope-based resistance, I\u2019ve stopped using erg, but most workouts in the database don\u2019t have slopes specified.\nUser Problem: Need for slope adjustments and modifications in workouts.\nAnswer: Oh very interesting on the adding slopes. That could almost be a setting in the app. \u201cAdd Slopes to workouts without slopes.\u201d We have some automatic conversion but I am not sure if that would work for you. Lengths of reps and rests might fit into my design idea.\nSolution: Consideration of adding a setting for slopes in the app.\n\nQ&A 6:\nQuestion: That\u2019s an interesting idea on automatic slopes. Since trainers, preferred cadence, and abilities vary, perhaps you could add an option to associate certain slopes with % of FTP (like w/power and HR zones). That can be done on the website (since it\u2019s a one-time thing), and then on the phone app there could be a toggle to use these default \u201cslope zone\u201d settings based on % of FTP, or to override those and use the slope specified in the workout if available (or set manually if not). For either scenario, the user could still use the slider to fine tune on the fly, but it would be convenient to be able to predetermine the slope to associate with a given power level.\nUser Problem: Need for customizable slope settings based on FTP.\nAnswer: That is a very interesting idea. Even when desiging a workout you could just enter slopes and automatically get % of FTP base on your own conversions. I will have to think on this more.\nSolution: Acknowledgment of the idea and consideration for future design.",

Sometimes I\u2019m not having the best day or I\u2019m having a really good day, it\u2019s nice to be able to manually scale the power up or down. However, the problem is that 10% is a really huge change and I find it gets too hard or too easy with each adjustment. I was wondering if we can do finer adjustments like 2.5% or 5%? Anything smaller would require too many button presses. Maybe others can chime in on which adjustment would work best for them.

Whenever I do a sweet spot workout I can usually manage to to finish the interval section but by the time I am done I dont have enough in the tank to finish the endurance section. I am on the serious italian plan. Is it ok to to lower the intensity and try to finish it out or am I over reaching and should consider changing my plan? or something else entirely I am missing,\n\nPost 2 by MedTechCD:\nIf you can\u2019t do the endurance part after SweetSpot, your FTP is most likely overestimated. Sweetspot should feel hard but shouldn\u2019t leave you drained to the point that you can\u2019t do endurance anymore. It might seem too much the first 5-10 min but you should quickly recover enough to do the endurance part in pretty comfortable way. You may want to try a bit more recovery after your last SS interval before starting the endurance work but honestly, reducing FTP by 5-10W is much more likely to bring you long term results. It will also avoid too much fatigue build-up which could be the underlying reason of your problem. One more thing to follow up on: do you replenish energy during those SweetSpot intervals? They take a lot of carbs out and that might equally be the reason that you feel to weak for the endurance part.\n\nPost 3 by Fallingdown420:\nyes for the 90+ min sessions i have 2 bottles with formula 369 in it. My 20 min test gave me the 207 ftp.

I\u00b4m not going to say that this is impossible, but it is very, very unlikely\n\nPost 5 by Robert_UCL:\nHi Fallingdown 420, I would say two bottles is not enough. Since you are training indoors, you are probably sweating more. 750ml per hour should be fine. If you are making an isotonic drink, you only have 30 grams of carbs per hour. That is not a lot, although you should be able to finish your workout if your glycogen stores are full. So, the next question is: are your glycogen stores full? In other words: are you eating enough? The simple checklist for your problem is: do an FTP test to check your FTP If your FTP is right, go to step 2: 2) do the training while eating 70-90gr of carbs per hour. If that doesn\u2019t solve the problem, go to step 3: 3) Download an app to track your energy intake and fix it if necessary. The last step is always a good step to do. It\u2019s a pain to do, but if you do this for a week (don\u2019t forget to include workdays and a weekend) you have a treasure of information. Have fun, Coach Robert\n\nPost 6 by dthrog00:\nHow hard is the workout? Can you share the interval details?",

For the 30/15\u2019s the goal is to build up lactate. The rest is to short to let the body recover. That is different from 1 minute zone 5 followed by 1 minute of rest. In that workout the aim will be to let you recover just enough before your next effort. In the end you have to look at what you need in a race. If you\u2019re riding gran fondo\u2019s for fun there is not really a difference. These workouts will build you more power. If you do short mtb races, you will do short climbs and you want to focus on 1-2 minutes of vo2 power. If you do road races you might want to get ahead of the peloton and do 4-5 minutes of vo2 power.

        "text": "I am thinking that this is putting my leg muscles into an effort level that is higher than Zone 2. I know that the Zone 2 HR target is based on HR of course, but it seems to me that the initial load placed directly on the leg muscles is well above this effort and might reduce or delay the actual Zone 2 adaptations until many minutes later into the workout. This belief comes from what I have read about the importance of not getting above the Zone 2 upper limits because you are then getting into lower Zone 3 and you lose the adaptations that you are after. Have you created your own workout using Erg mode for your warmup to approach this \u201csteady state\u201d HR (and associated watts) in a gentler manner? That is what I will be trying, but if you have already done so, is your workout posted in the searchable workouts? Thanks.\n\nPost 13 by potsiea1:\nMy experience is the same as yours. Power increases too quickly for me with the latest version as it tries to hit the target HR within 6-7 minutes, and this drives the power level well over what is sustainable for an endurance ride, so then I go into recovery mode as such for the middle portion at a power level that is below what I can maintain at that HR in a steady state ride. I am possibly an outlier though, as I had a heart attack 3 months ago, and this might be affecting my HR response (certainly affecting my power!) I have a workout called \u201cERG/HR 60\u201d that works better for me. The warmup is in ERG mode, and then i switch over to HR control once I have started the main set. I changed it from private to public, so you should be able to find it.\n\nPost 14 by Alex:\nYes, sorry just got out of hospital for a few days. I need to test this more and possibly make some changes, if your HR and power are fairly stable and close to your target switching to HR mode was not supposed to drastically affect the power. I will also have my developer check his code.\n\nPost 15 by app4g:\nhave you considered doing a step-by-step increment? instead of setting it at 120. set it to say 80 then when it reaches 80, you up it again and so on? Note: this is actually a reply to @rmac\n\nPost 16 by Alex:\nSo my tester just tried it and he had stable HR before switching to HR, but then switching to HR after HR did not cause any power change. I don\u2019t remember are you also using external power meter. Can you send me another link to this workout? image934\u00d71820 184 KB\n\nPost 17 by MedTechCD:\nUsed it three times. I start with a lower HR target around 90-100 and then increase to my final target 122.\n\nPost 18 by MedTechCD:\nHere\u2019s an interesting post on Warm-up protocol and what you can learn from it: feelthebyrn.substack.com The Swedish Active Readiness Test AKA The \"SART\"\n\nPost 19 by Alex:\nYep I like the idea. I am not sure all athletes see HR suppression, I am pretty sure I don\u2019t, so this might be subset of athletes (or humans). For me raised cortisol with associated waking up in the night not able to sleep is sure sign but I can only assume suppressed HR is further down the path or maybe when you live closer to the edge all the time.\n\nPost 20 by potsiea1:\nI will test it again today and confirm one way or the other, as what I observed when testing the first time was not obvious in the ride data",

        "text": "Increase Aerobic Power: VO2 max workouts increase the power and speed you can maintain aerobically. This is particularly beneficial for endurance sports, as it allows for higher sustained speeds. Enhance Recovery Ability: Regularly performing high-intensity workouts can improve your body\u2019s ability to recover between efforts. This is due to improved blood flow and increased efficiency in clearing metabolic byproducts from the muscles. Boost Overall Performance: By improving aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, and recovery, VO2 max workouts contribute to overall athletic performance. This is particularly important in sports that require sustained efforts, such as cycling, running, and rowing. Typical VO2 Max Workouts VO2 max workouts generally involve high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which includes: Intervals: Short bursts of high-intensity exercise (e.g., 3-5 minutes) at or near your VO2 max, followed by rest or low-intensity periods. Tabata Intervals: Very short, extremely high-intensity intervals (20 seconds on, 10 seconds off) repeated multiple times. Hill Repeats: Running or cycling up a hill at high intensity, then recovering on the way down or on flat ground. Pyramids: Gradually increasing the duration of high-intensity intervals, followed by decreasing them in a pyramid-like structure. Implementation Tips Progress Gradually: Start with shorter, less intense intervals and gradually increase the duration and intensity as your fitness improves. Monitor Intensity: Use heart rate monitors, power meters, or perceived exertion scales to ensure you are working at the correct intensity. Rest and Recovery: Allow adequate recovery between intervals and ensure proper rest days between VO2 max workouts to prevent overtraining. Periodization: Incorporate VO2 max workouts into your training plan strategically, usually during the build phase leading up to key events or races. In summary, VO2 max workouts are a critical component of a well-rounded training program aimed at enhancing aerobic capacity, improving cardiovascular efficiency, and boosting overall athletic performance.\nSolution: Progress gradually and focus on enjoyment in workouts.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Hi Leigh, Coach Robert here. What you are describing is that you see your heart rate increasing during a 30/15 workout. That is entirely normal. This is a very hard workout to do and heart rate is not the best way to monitor this. It takes te body some time to respond. Around 30-60 seconds. So when your first 30 sec are over your heart rate will still be rising. But then you take a 15 sec rest. That first rest is just enough to stop the increase and, if you\u2019re in really good shape, might even show a slow decrease. During the first set the body will fatigue and you will be short on oxygen. After a couple of reps the body realizes that this situation is not going to get better and oxygen demand stays high. Therefore the heart will elevate slightly during the set. The next set you already start with some fatigue. That is why the heart rate will increase even more. In general, it will take the body around 3 minutes to reach a steady state. Provided that the effort stays the same. Since the rest is so short, the level of effort stays fairly simular. However, it is so high that the body builds up oxygen deprivation, free radicals, lactate, and ions. The pain you feel in the legs is not lactate. It is H-ions. We used to believe that it was lactate, but actually, lactate is a byproduct that serves as an energy provider at lower intensities. So, with this in mind, what should you do? My first advice is to do this workout as it is. Don\u2019t go harder in earlier reps and don\u2019t go easier in later reps. If you go harder you will burn out to soon. You need those \u201ceasier\u201d reps to get to the end. Same as you need the intensity at the end to make the difference. Follow this routine for 4 weeks, than move on to a different workout. There are many different VO2 max workouts. Al lot of them have different training goals. For the 30/15\u2019s the goal is to build up lactate. The rest is to short to let the body recover.",

        "text": "Forum Q&A: Adjust Trainer Power to Match PM on outside bike\nCategory: Feature Requests\nTopic Type: Feature Requests\n\nQ&A 1:\nQuestion: Is there any way of adjusting the power reported by the trainer to match the power from your your outside bike so your metrics are the same inside and out. Ie my trainer reads consistently 9% lower than my power meter on my bike. NB 1 .I know what Power Match is and that is not what I talking about and 2. It is not feasible for me use my outside bike on my trainer on a consistent basis. Thanks\nUser Problem: Trainer reads consistently 9% lower than power meter.\nAnswer: How do you know that your trainer reads 9% lower? Probably because you set up your outside bike on the trainer and compared power output from both? Are we talking about a wheel-on trainer? If so, this will sound disapointing but with another bike on your trainer, it is almost 100% sure that power values will be different. That is because power from a wheel-on trainer is very dependent on the bike/trainer interface. Two different bikes have a different position on the trainer and thus the tension off the trainer roller on the tire is different. The tires are different and probably the tire pressure is different. So you can\u2019t simply port the power from one bike to another on these trainers. If you can temporarely transfer the power meter to your inside bike, you can make it match quite closely. Check this post: https://forums.trainerday.com/t/power-match-not-working-well-on-shorter-intervals/987/12?u=medtechcd After doing that, remove your Power Meter and do not recalibrate your trainer!\nSolution: Transfer the power meter to the inside bike for accurate comparison.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Yes I\u2019ve put my outside bike on the trainer for s number of rides and 9 % is the average variance. It\u2019s a wheel off trainer (Elite Zumo) and die to where I live it\u2019s not practical to keep taking the bike in & off it. There are lots of posts on numerous forums about this issue and it seems to me there is a simple solution. On the the training platform enable a power scaling factor to increase or decrease the reported and recorded power. Xert used to do it but the feature is missing from the latest apps. There are ways round it but it\u2019s inconvenient and time consuming\nUser Problem: Inconvenience of adjusting power readings.\nAnswer: This is interesting. It\u2019s like power match without a second power device. Now that I hear it I am surprised no one else has requested this. This does sound easy but somehow it scares me that it might not be. Let me think on this a bit.\nSolution: Consideration of the power scaling factor feature.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Just a note to say that I would very much appreciate and use a linear \u201cadjustment factor\u201d (for example, \u201c+3.5%\u201d or \u201c-2%\u201d with TrainerDay. The reason it matters to me (and the reason I would use it over just adding the +/- % during the workout) is because I like to do a lot of post-ride analysis (calculating TSS, using intervals.icu, identifying best performances over certain periods of time) and when my power meters read vastly different numbers, these analyses are less useful (for example, all my best performances appear indoors, when in reality it\u2019s just because my indoor trainer is a consistent 8% higher than my outdoor power meter)\u2026\nUser Problem: Difficulty in post-ride analysis due to power discrepancies.\nAnswer: Some how I have warmed up to this idea. I think I was stressed with bugs or something last time it was requested\u2026 Always a little stressed with some bug here or there but they seem to be getting smaller and smaller other than for the person that is affected\u2026 Anyway, overall I like this idea, meaning I don\u2019t love power match or at least our power match and really a linear adjustment is all that most people should need that use power meters to get it close enough. So let me have my developer analyze this and see what we can do.\nSolution: Will analyze the feasibility of a linear adjustment feature.",

However sometimes it is nice to have a bit of a change and so I have been using Erg mode and it is not quite working for me like it used to on TR. My Neo 2 over reads compared to my Assioma Duo\u2019s at endurance power. At sweet spot they are sort of similar and then at Vo2 the Neo under reads compared to my Assioma. So jumping from 40% recovery to 120% intervals really kills me as the power match takes about 30 seconds of about 130-140% effort before it recalibrates the power match off set to bring me down to 120%. Is it possible for the power match algorithm to be reworked such that it is a bit more responsive? Many thanks for all your help. Karl\nContext: User is comparing performance between different modes and devices.\nUser Problem: Power match takes too long to recalibrate during intervals.\nAnswer: There is a bug going from slope mode to erg with power match, but yes we also need to create a new version of power match. Another solution is to turn off power match, but it will still record power from pedals, and just press - to slight adjust actual target. This should give you exactly what you need if your offset is consistent and you don\u2019t mind that actual shows different then target by a little\nSolution: Turn off power match and manually adjust the target.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I understand entirely and thank you for your comments. I have done a work around for myself in line with your comments. Initially I did a dual recorded workout (TD - Neo Erg / Garmin - Assioma) with TD setting the erg power for all of my common interval FTP percentages. From the data I created a little spreadsheet showing the results and what the Neo Erg needs to be set at so that Assioma\u2019s power is appropriate. Then I made Erg mode versions of my upcoming workouts with the FTP percentages suitably adjusted (ie 40% is now 45%, 108% is now 106%, 125% is now 120% etc). Then in the interval comments I put the real target watts for me to monitor on my Garmin watch and make on the fly adjustments as necessary. Worked perfectly the first time I tried it with Neo only connected to TD and Assioma\u2019s only connected to Garmin. Disregard the TD workout & save the Garmin workout.\nContext: User implemented a workaround to adjust power settings.\nUser Problem: Need for precise power settings during workouts.\nAnswer: Oh thank you for the feedback. My thinking is that level of precision is not that important (Our Coach Andrea generally thinks so as well) and if you agreed you could just connect both assioma and neo to our app and press -5% and make your warmups a little harder in general. At least you could just design your workouts normally. If your process does not bother you then it\u2019s not the end of the world as our editor is fast if you don\u2019t have a million workout variations Also I understand some people are just perfectionists or there are always \u201cit depends\u201d situations that precision is required. If you are doing a 2X20 then accuracy becomes more critical even if just from a mental perspective In my solution your completed line would be a bit above the blue target (target shows 150w and actual shows 160w) in our app but you could just use our app. You still might use the Garmin to record with at the same time to get it in GC but at least it would be secondary to watching our screen. I will keep this in mind. We could just create an offset matrix as well. Like \u201cmanual/auto power match\u201d that would be much easier than power match 2.0. This discussion helps me in general so thanks.\nSolution: Consider connecting both devices and adjusting the target power.",

My nature is that I get pleasure out of making my cycling stuff (bike, kit, indoor set up etc etc) work perfectly for me and so creating new workouts is all part of the fun\ud83d\ude04. However the downside is that embarrassingly if the interval calls for 220w and my average is only 219w then somehow that feels nowhere near as satisfying as 220w\ud83e\udd21!!!\n\nPost 7 by kam:\nYour manual power match off set is interesting and got me thinking. This is probably totally impractical or not possible but just to add to the conversation and thought evolution process, For me it would be cool to have a manual power match option where all data displayed in the app is from the power meter and the original workout. However the app is using just the smart trainer to control erg mode. The original workout file could have an additional column for \u201cmanual erg mode off set\u201d where you could enter the relevant off set you would like applied to each interval step. Then the icing the cake would be to have a universal off set matrix withins your account which would be applied to all workouts if the manual power match option was selected. This universal off set matrix would allow you to set the required off set for all of your commonly used FTP%'s.\n\nPost 8 by Alex:\nInteresting idea. This is basically like our automated slope mode but automated ERG adjustment mode. Just to show visual version like below. Like you said it\u2019s a hidden offset so you don\u2019t really see it other than maybe a small number like power match is now. image1898\u00d71616 284 KB I don\u2019t think that many people would want this but I can say it\u2019s an interesting way to solve the problem. Seems like better power match would be more ideal but really this should be more accurate for your trainer but the problem is for wheel-on trainers that need power match the most this does not help. They have temperature variations. If you always kept your bike in the same gear you could do this with slope mode now\n\nPost 9 by kam:\nExcellent graphic Alex !!! Very good \u201cbalanced seeing the bigger picture\u201d view point .\n\nPost 10 by MedTechCD:\nThe situation for direct drive trainers that have very little or no temperature drift can be one of these three (actually four): Spot-on Fixed offset all over the range Offset varying by power value (speed value) Fixed + variable offset This should be easy to correct for by simply applying a formula behind the screens like Corrected value = x + y * applied value. Where x is the fixed offset and y a parameter for the variable part. You would off course need to fine-tune both values for your specific trainer compared to your power meter. It can be of some value for wheel-on trainers but those will still have considerable drift caused by heat. My suggestion would be to apply the formula behind the scenes and have both correction values as a setting.\n\nPost 11 by Alex:\nAnother good idea. @kam my guess is fixed + offset would solve your problem and be a one time apply, set and forget. @MedTechCD is this something you would like as well?",

I\u2019m actually putting out 109W (from the power meter and measured concurrently on say a Garmin). If I was then to put the Power Scaling factor to 1.09 and continue pedalling at the same intensity the App which is showing the power from the trainer would show 109W which would now match the 109W shown from the PM on the Garmin because the intensity hasn\u2019t changed. In this case the .fit file from the app would show the initial period at 100W then the 2nd period at 109W.\n\nPost 7 by carytb:\none problem is that the % variation can change with intensity and sometimes it can be a fixed offset plus a % variation.

I do try to figure things out on my own as much as possible. I have a question about the ride feel or intensity in the CJ training plan. From what I can tell, there are two ways to adjust the intensity: the slider and the radio buttons. Screenshot 2025-03-25 at 9.34.24 AM639\u00d7734 56.8 KB I\u2019ve been experimenting with different combinations, but I can\u2019t quite figure out what each one is actually doing. I notice the workouts get harder or easier, but I want to understand how they change. What exactly does the slider affect, and what do the radio buttons do? When should I use one over the other, depending on what I want to get out of the training? For context, I\u2019m quite motivated and can handle tough sessions, but I\u2019m not looking to bury myself on the trainer every day, haha. I get that \u201charder\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean \u201cbetter,\u201d so I\u2019m trying to find the most effective setup\u2014getting the best results with the least unnecessary suffering. Would appreciate any insights on how the intensity adjusters work. Thanks a lot!\n\nPost 2 by dthrog00:\nNot Alex, but from a user perspective: Intensity number = what difficulty the non-zone 2 workout is. Each of the blocks goes from 1 to 21 with the difficulty increasing as the number goes up. Zone 2 intensity goes up slightly also as the number increases. Text descriptions = how difficult are the zone 2 sections of the workout. Level 1 + Mostly Easy may be ~ 60%. Level 1 + Tried The Above Options will be quite a bit higher, over 70%? Dave\n\nPost 3 by Alex:\nYes Dave has it right. Intensity increases the \u201cMain work level\u201d which mostly means the main work has more or longer intervals and ride feel increases the intensity of the secondary work. See below image1229\u00d7354 57.8 KB\n\nPost 4 by lonewolfcyclist:\nAh okay I understand now. Thank you!",

I am on vacation and responding slowly to non-emergencies. The rules are fairly complex, it\u2019s generally taking the last 10 second average and adjusting the target every 30 seconds, I think it lowers the target if it is 2% greater than the target and it increases rather slowly but I don\u2019t remember the exact rules. If you want to control the warmup or want a rapid change then switching to ERG mode is the best way. If you are in ERG mode at 200w for 30 seconds and then switch to HR mode it will start at 200w and adjust from there. Hope that helps.\nSolution: Switching to ERG mode for better control over warmup or rapid changes.",

        "text": "Next button is kind of the oposite of that, meaning it just skips to the end of the current interval. If you use a music player of some sort and press back it goes to the beginning of the song again, but if you press it quickly again then it goes to the previous song start. This is essentially a double click to get an \u201cinterval set.\u201d The problem is when you press next twice, the intervals are essentially deleted so back would just repeat what you previously did not what you removed unless we do some magic that makes it work like undo for a period of time but I think that makes it even more confusing. A temporary undo button would be safer. Navigating to a specifc point is a bit confusing too. Meaning after you navigate backwards then you don\u2019t want one power reading going over the top of the other one. You esentially want to extend the work, so once you click on the navigation point we need to insert the amount of work you selected. I think back button is safer or more clear. I have learned anything that is slighly confusing to me becomes seriously confusing for users. Anyway I am very apprecitave of your ideas. Users ideas are frequently better than mine\n\nPost 5 by Corrado:\nThanks, glad to help. I see. I didn\u2019t think about how navigating the workout might collide with the recorded data and the chart. Very much looking forward to that new UI. If you still need beta testers count me in! Cheers, Konrad\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nCool. Not sure if you joined the beta group here. Do that and just send me a direct message with your email and if you use iOS or Android.\n\nPost 7 by Lombo:\nNot that I really understand how to code, but in my imagination everything left from the bar was \u201crecorded\u201d. Everything right of it is coming and these are two channels of information. Maybe two colours for the lines and you could move backward on the \u201cplanned graph\u201d and the recording \u201cseismographic needle\u201d is still working. But again my sense for coding made a turn 20 years ago. I had sometimes the problem that I double-tapped the screen by mistake and the intervall was \u201cgone\u201d. What about gestures? Two fingers swipe left backward and the same to the right. Yes it could confuse users or it could end as a hidden feature, but it could also be a solution.\n\nPost 8 by Alex:\nYes, lombo, you are right \u201cwe can remember everything.\u201d One of our testers also wants a gesture or a longer hold required for next making it more difficult to click twice on accient. My current thinking is that to temporarily show an UNDO button when you click next, and you can undo multiple times if you click multiple times. I am aware it is totally frustrating to \u201cdelete\u201d an important interval.\n\nPost 9 by Lombo:\nSounds good, I\u2019m looking forward to that feature. The gesture was just an idea, you know the details and also the complaints if something does not work\n\nPost 10 by Alex:\nGesture is not bad idea\u2026 I just prefer to make it more obvious so I don\u2019t have to keep answering the same questions over and over. I prefer to spend my time and love to answer new questions over and over\n\nPost 11 by laserpez:\nSorry, has this feature ben implemented?\n\nPost 12 by Alex:\nYes, but you have to think about it differently Meaning rather than move to previous, it\u2019s duplicate last interval, you can see more here.

Which could be a specific duration rest so you click +, favorite and insert. If you like modifying the the length of rest or interval obviously this one is much more useful. My example has 5 clicks but if you want if you wanted seconds it might be 3 clicks. Please give my ideas a try here and let me know if this \u201cfavorite\u201d idea would help a lot. It still would be 2 clicks meaning if you always used favorite it could go back to that each time so one for + and one for insert. So one extra click from before. Let me know. I will create a video. As I said I think this needs some fine tuning, I just wanted to let everyone try it and give feedback first. image2370\u00d71888 316 KB\n\nPost 4 by Tayno_25:\nYes I would love a \u201cfavorite\u201d interval. For me I would want it to just be a First Effort set to 30 seconds at the same watts of the current interval I am doing, with the Second Effort set to \u201cOff\u201d. This way I can simply add 30 second blocks to the current effort I\u2019m doing if I feel strong and want to extend it. I find this handy whenever I\u2019m doing interval work and want to push myself a little extra. I think our disconnect is that in this feature you are giving the ability to add \u201cintervals\u201d (ie: more repetitions of efforts), where as I\u2019m usually more concerned with just adding time onto the current interval I am doing. Let me know if this makes sense.\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nOne of the two intervals that shows when you popup now should be the watts you are doing, the the only thing is it might take some clicks to get it to 30 seconds and turn off the other interval. I would love it if you played with it more and see how difficult the current solution is but for sure I assume there is some method of \u201cfavorite.\u201d The problem I am afraid of is that each person might have different kinds of favorites.\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nOk look at this. So it would remember your last settings for favorite and if last time you chose favorite it would default to favorite. So in this case once you set it to 30 seconds and current interval Power percent, it would always give you that (what you had before). So 2 clicks to give you what you had instead of 1. image2422\u00d71714 275 KB\n\nPost 7 by Jeffct:\nHi Alex. I\u2019m all for adding new features and keep improving the tech but for me ,personally, the new \u2018+\u2019 features was too much. I personally much preferred the simplified version that you previously had. All I really need is the ability to be able to press one button to extend the current interval by x minute. Specially when I\u2019m really struggling and my HR is through the roof, It\u2019s really hard to fiddle around with all the buttons. If I feel like I can extend a current interval, I\u2019m always gradually adding an extra 5mins. Once that 5mins is almost over and if I feel like I can keep going, I just need to press the + icon. With this new one, it requires too many steps to simply add 5mins. If there\u2019s any way to bring back the simplified + button or to enable the simplified option through the settings, that would be amazing! Also, the new feature does not display the current interval, which I found frustrating.",

I\u2019m finding this new + feature far too complicated when I\u2019m just wanting to extend a rest interval when doing hard intervals. The old + 10 seconds button was much appreciated when needing to get your breath back when your mentally as well as physically fatigued. For me this new feature of adding intervals, while a great idea, should be kept separate from the original.\n\nPost 11 by Alex:\nYes the problem is on some devices we did not have enough room for an additional button because putting buttons too close together causes people to click the wrong one on accident. I had a good idea that I can add a \u201clock feature.\u201d Which you set the duration you want one time and select current % and lock and then from then on you just press + like it used to be, and if you want to \u201cunlock it\u201d to make changes you just do a long press. Then you have exactly what you had. image1212\u00d71632 174 KB\n\nPost 12 by Sport_IT_Diederik:\nLove this new feature !! I tried it out and I do believe I ran into a bug. Alex : check out this file: Trainer Day - Activity Detail I did a first block of 3 repeats. Then I wanted to do the same again. Afer the 3rd \u201cfirst interval\u201d, the second effort was not added and as such the trainer was \u201cstuck\u201d in the first effort. Which I left on for 5 minutes since I liked the challenge The advanges of \u201crandom training\u201d\u2026 I do have one \u201cfeature request\u201d : you are now limited to 3 repeats, would it be difficult to add \u201cmore\u201d, like up to 5? If anybody else is interested. btw : trainerday is becoming more and more ahead of the \u201cavatar tools\u201d\u2026 I was speaking with some junior competitive riders in the last week. Who had no clue something like Trainerday even exists\u2026 Their coaches are showing a serious lack of understanding to be honest\u2026 Not lack of understand of tools, but lack of understanding how physiology works. What I\u2019m really wondering : how difficult will it be when the continuous lactate meters arrive to take that input instead of the heart rate ?",

I\u2019m a 50+ working cycling enthousiast, enjoying cycling, but with one big goal : an Alpine event this summer. I\u2019m usually doing my \u201ctough day\u201d on a Wednesday. As probably a lot of us recognize, one Wednesday is not the other. For pro racers, a fixed workout makes perfect sense : this is what you have to do (unless you are sick). For us, working class cyclists, it doesn\u2019t work like that. Which is where THE top feature of Trainer Day comes in. My point is : I can take a schedule with 3x10 HIIT repeats. One week it can work, the other \u2026 not really. Of course you can always stop a session and scroll forward, but I hate doing that. Or the other way round, sometimes I feel really good and I would like to add another block (I realise pro cyclists are not supposed to do that, they have to follow the exact schedule, but again, I\u2019m just a working guy). So what did I do : I created \u201cHIIT blocks\u201d (Trainer Day - Workout: Sport IT HIIT Block 10). From 10 repeats, over 8-6-4-2. I start with a workout plan I think I can do. Or with no plan at all. Do my warmup and then take a 10 block to start. After that, I add whatever I think works that day. It\u2019s one of the stunning features of Trainer Day which totally works for me!\nContext: User shares personal experience with HIIT training and how Trainer Day features help him adapt workouts.\nUser Problem: Difficulty in sticking to a fixed workout schedule due to varying daily conditions.\nAnswer: You are doing it perfect, in our opinion!!! Even pros should be training by feel. I am working on a video right now talking about this. We would love to have the ability to \u201cadd an an interval set work/rest\u201d with 1 click which would even simplify that farther, but I do the same as you so I know it\u2019s not that bad other than in the middle of something hard fiddling around kind sucks. Really happy, this is working for you though!!!\nSolution: Encouragement and acknowledgment of user\u2019s approach; mention of a potential feature for easier interval management.",

I am just coming back to using TrainerDay again, using it on my large monitor with Samsung DEX on my phone, and have noticed the workout list layout has changed. I can only see the title of the workout and not the interval blocks. This only happens when I\u2019m using it in Samsung DEX mode. I have attached a photo to show what I mean. It means I can\u2019t see how the workouts are structured when I scroll through the list. I hope this can be fixed.! 20240227_151310|666x500\nContext: Returning user using Samsung DEX on a large monitor.\nUser Problem: Can't see the structure of workouts in the list.\nAnswer: Hmmm, we will think about this but it\u2019s a strange use case that I don\u2019t know if we can fix. One is this is likely hard and two is it is just too rare of case. Sorry about that. What are you actually trying to do? Maybe there is another solution. We also have this broadcast screen for viewing app in a web page.\nSolution: Consider using the broadcast screen for viewing the app.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: All I want to do is connect my Samsung phone to my monitor using Samsung DEX, and use TrainerDay. The app opens up fine, but the workout list view doesn\u2019t show the structure of each workout in the list, it\u2019s as though the bottom part is hidden because on some of the workouts I can see the very tops of tall intervals. I had Another major issue today when actually starting a workout. It started the warm up power perfectly at a low 140 watts and kept a straight line, but when it was supposed to ramp up to the next 15 minute interval it just stayed the same. I kept it going for a few minutes to see if it would change, but it didn\u2019t. It stayed on 140 watts the entire time. It was supposed to be 199 watts. Because of this I had to reinstate my Trainerroad subscription and use that instead. I\u2019m afraid to say that I\u2019m going to have to cancel my TrainerDay subscription again as it\u2019s unusable. Which is a real shame as there are many aspect of it that I prefer over Trainerroad.\nContext: User is experiencing issues with workout structure visibility and power output during workouts.\nUser Problem: Workout list view not showing structure and power output not changing.\nAnswer: Ok sorry to hear. Occasionally people with some trainers have this issue but it seems pretty rare. Pressing + - solves it but if TrainerRoad it is, TrainerRoad it is. They have a lot of money and large testing team with lots of devices so they can currently afford to be more stable for all device combinations, although many users have issues there as well. But still % wise less than us. Our broadcast feature would allow you to do what you want.\nSolution: Pressing + - may solve the issue.",

I think you are correct that the app can\u2019t be resized to a single column because of limitations in Stage Manager.

Where it could override the default iOS setting? That would be awesome, as then it would be app specific and there would be no need to change it before/after every workout. What about the ability to select the location and visibility of the workout parameters? I think it might appeal to all users, as then you could basically make the TD app look (almost) like your outdoor headunit in terms of what parameter is located where on the screen. What about being able to select a font size?\n\nPost 4 by app4g:\nmaamen: Could the \u2018Reduce White Point\u2019 be made an option in the TD settings? Where it could override the default iOS setting? I do not believe there\u2019s any settings that can override the default iOS settings for that app itself. It should be a system wide setting. But Im not sure. I only found a way to programatically reduce the system brightness (eg below reduces it to 0 brightness) UIScreen.main.brightness = 0.0 but this would affect your youtube screen as well. maamen: What about the ability to select the location and visibility of the workout parameters?

The GCN+ app is a TV app rather than a computer app. Hovering a chrome plugin would be nice (a bit like Xert?) but also I am happy enough with the work arounds that you have suggested.

(Poderia ter essa informa\u00e7\u00e3o no final do treino ap\u00f3s a finaliza\u00e7\u00e3o dele, como informativo) No local destas informa\u00e7\u00f5es seria muito mais produtivo visualizar o TSS e o IF no momento de execu\u00e7\u00e3o do treino. Esses sim s\u00e3o informa\u00e7\u00f5es importantes do n\u00edvel do treino\u2026 pois um plano de treino sempre informa o n\u00edvel de intensidade (IF) e o volume (TSS) do treino.\nUser Problem: A tela de execu\u00e7\u00e3o do treino n\u00e3o mostra informa\u00e7\u00f5es que considero importantes.\nAnswer: Many serious European cyclists use KJ and Calories (including pro coaches) as well as many TD users care about Calories. IF and TSS are something that matter before or after the workout but I don\u2019t see why they are needed during the workout. Please explain why they are needed while training? Do you mean the TSS you have done so far? I don\u2019t see a use for workout IF/TSS during training. I do see a use for planning purposes. Just giving my opinion, happy to hear yours.\nSolution: None provided.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Exatamente isso. Desta maneira conseguimos acompanhar a intensidade e o stress de maneira instant\u00e2nea. Lembra muito o computador de bordo de alguns ve\u00edculos que informam o consumo de combust\u00edvel no momento.\nUser Problem: Desejo acompanhar a intensidade e o estresse em tempo real.\nAnswer: Fuel consumption is heart rate oxygen is the fuel. TSS and IF are just made up numbers.\nSolution: None provided.",

        "text": "It\u2019s highly motivational to make your progress visible.\n\nPost 7 by JenMDX:\nThanks @MedTechCD I reached out to my bike manufacturer (Sole Fitness) about the resistance and wattage and it seems that the wattage is only based on RPM so I assume it will be consistent over rides but I\u2019m wondering what metrics I\u2019m best to track to see those improvements. I have a spreadsheet with all my rides in. Distance is useless because my bike and Zwift don\u2019t match. I was going with HR and Total Output (KJoules) but if the wattage is a bit arbitrary then I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the best option? Or does it work because over time I will naturally increase cadence?\n\nPost 8 by MedTechCD:\nIt depends on how the spin bike works. What\u2019s the exact model of your bike? I will try to dig up how it works internally. 99% of all indoor trainers have no power meter. All they do is convert flywheel speed to power with an offset depending on the resistance level. You can very easily check that by accelerating to a higher speed and then stop pedaling. If there is a power meter in the trainer, power will be 0 within a couple seconds. If you see a gradual decline of power while spinning down, it\u2019s as said above, speed converted to power. If the spin bike does the same, your easiest way to follow up on progress, is to take some parts of your ride where you ride at constant speed/rpm. Divide flywheel speed (from the bike, not from Zwift) by average HR for that part and you have a perfect metric to spot progress. More speed for the same HR means that you are getting better.\n\nPost 9 by JenMDX:\nThanks! It\u2019s a Sole SB900. I thought it had a power meter when I bought it. There\u2019s no resistance shown on the monitor. I was torn between the Sole and the Schwinn IC4/IC8. The Schwinn does show resistance on the screen but was put off by having to plug it in and reliability issues. Perhaps I can upgrade in the future. Anyway, this is what I got back from HQ this morning: Please see below response from HQ: The computer system works that transmitter sends the RPM signal to the console for the calculation. Then the console displays the relevant readings which request the RPM value to show speed distance, calories\u2026etc. The resistant system of SB900 is controlled by the magnetic system. The magnet set is controlled by the adjustable knob to increase or decrease the resistance. But it is not equipped with the dynamometric device or the additional sensor for the resistant calculation. The Watt on the console will be only referred to the reading of the speed changes, it can\u2019t perform according to the resistance changes. Okay, so I could perhaps record laps to get an accurate HR for a given period. I got the qdomyos-zwift app which I thought would help with accuracy for Zwift but I\u2019m not sure it makes any difference as I would rather use the bike that will be the same across any app. It does give me various metrics though for the ride and can do laps.\n\nPost 10 by Alex:\nI see this screen. image758\u00d7554 61 KB So you can monitor progress fairly simply. Find a comfortable RPM say like 70 RPM and comfortable resistance (let\u2019s use 20 as an example) What ever you choose it should seem like it is easy for 30 minutes to an hour. Then warmup for 20 minutes and get your heart rate to say 120bpm and then track your HR for Resistance=20 RPM=70 for 10 minutes. And then do that same test and see your heart rate after a month. In general your heart rate should be going down and you know you are getting in better shape. I would almost guarantee you will see improvement if you are consistent.",

Yeah, I went full bore on Maffetone for about 2-years but really I think it is great from a learning perspective but I don\u2019t think it is 100% necessary from a training perspective, meaning maybe it is something you do once for 3-6 months, understand it then you can vary the program to make it more variable and more fun If you are in the close to burned out phase now, maybe take 1-2 weeks completely off (to be super safe) then do pure zone 2 for 2 months at the minimum and then you can start to do a Coach Jack build plan for example Serious Italian and if you still want to focus on fat burning you can put the zone 2 work in the beginning. If you want more ideas on any of this, as I said I am happy to share. Generally a yearly 2-month base zone 2 phase is usually enough to get that aerobic engine working especially if you can put in some bigger hours but many people can see benefit doing it longer. Also you can do rucking, fast walking, yard work, and all kinds of other activities to get in that Z2 work since it is really heart/fat focused.\nSolution: Adjust power daily to maintain HR limit; consider a 2-month zone 2 phase.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: I don\u2019t want to stare at my phone during my workout constantly checking my hr, has anyone ever used those earbuds or some other audible form of hr cue when it hits the target hr or goes over etc?\nContext: User is looking for a solution to monitor heart rate without constantly checking their phone.\nUser Problem: User is concerned about monitoring heart rate during workouts.\nAnswer: Everyone running with Maffetone does this, or watch arm vibration. We really need to build automatic HR mode so you just pedal. That is why I said determine your HR threshold and drop your power by about 5% below this and you should not have to worry too much about paying attention.\nSolution: Consider using automatic HR mode and adjust power to stay below HR threshold.",

How about that, @Alex?\nUser Problem: Desire for metrics similar to TrainingPeaks (TP) for better tracking.\nAnswer: What\u2019s funny is TP would let me use these names. Really, we probably should. In the beginning I thought they might see me as competition. I was friends with Mark at Golden Cheetah and he pissed them off so he had to stop using them, so I was nervous. I have really avoiding going down the metrics routes as it gets expensive due to a non-stop list of things people want and customizations to really making it work. Also I prefer limiting overlap with IntervalsICU as well as TP as they make better partners then competitors I have done endurance sports my whole life but about 12 years ago, I fell in love with TP PMC and WKO and metrics in general and see great value in stress management (less so in trying to maximize tss/ctl via intensity). I have not studied TrainerRoad in this regard. Not sure if you know. I guess they do a good job of this? A very light simple version might be ok\nSolution: Consider a light simple version of the metrics.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thanks for the elaborate feedback. I also use WKO so it\u2019s not a problem to look all the data, but a simple chart like in TP app solos be nice to see anyway. At least, in winter season IF all the training is done via TD app.\nContext: User mentions using WKO and expresses a desire for simpler charting.\nUser Problem: Need for a simple charting feature in TrainerDay.\nAnswer: WKO 3 was almost better than the all \u201cnew one\u201d (that took them years to get released\u2026 ) but I did use v4 and v5 for a few years as well. It\u2019s generally great for getting into the details, I guess the best (other than simplicity, trying to write complex functions takes a huge amount of time, for me anyway). GoldenCheetah might do most of what WKO does at least for the basics but could never get into it.\nSolution: Acknowledges the complexity of metrics and suggests alternatives.",

Your body sort of automatically balances both to get you as far as possible. That\u2019s why almost all cyclists start to grind when fatigued, except for those that have weak peripheral system and strong cardiovascular from x-training.\n\nPost 5 by Sport_IT_Diederik:\nHey Alex, correct, I should have said torque, but that\u2019s what I meant. Let me take the time to do the math\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nWhat math? I was just making up numbers. We have no idea of what RPM is going to cause what additional strain on someone\u2019s cardiovascular system. I am sure that is extremely individual and if it is not we would need to look at thousands of people doing steady state workouts to see if there is any consistent relationship. I guess I have this data So I think everything you are experiencing is totally normal and while interesting, especially if you are trying to maximize your performance I am not sure if it needs a lot of thought. You could do two workouts and different RPM average but same HR and see how you feel at the end of both of them.\n\nPost 7 by Sport_IT_Diederik:\nIt\u2019s not important. The important part is : it\u2019s working. But I do believe something is wrong with the WATT number shown. Let me try to explain. Imagine I do 150W at 80RPM. That means I do 1.875Nm torque. Say I do that at 120BPM HR. I get it, when I start doing 90RPM, my HR will go up. What that actually happens is that torque is adapted to 1.667Nm, so that my HR stays at 120. In both cases, the Wattage stays 150W. What happens in the app now is that the displayed wattage is shown at a lower number. Unless I\u2019m totally wrong in the logic, I believe this is not correct. But I can be totally wrong \u2026\n\nPost 8 by app4g:\nWhen you do a HR Structured Workout or a HR based workout, what happens is the app will not care what is the current wattage shown. The logic will only be to either Increase wattage or lower wattage to get your HR to be at the desired setpoint. If your HR goes up, the wattage will go down in an effort to get your HR to go back down and vice versa. No need to think about torque or such for HR Based workout.\n\nPost 9 by MedTechCD:\nSport_IT_Diederik: What happens in the app now is that the displayed wattage is shown at a lower number. That would be the case if you have a dumb trainer with a speed/power curve and you keep the same gearing. Higher cadence = higher speed = higher power. Smart trainers will simply show the result of torque x cadence and the power number will not change.\n\nPost 10 by R2Tom:\nThe power goes down because your heart rate goes up. So your torque settle more to 1.61 Nm in your example. But actually the app controls only the power (watts). If your heart rate is above a certain limit, it will decrease the power. If your heart rate is under a certain limit, it will increase the power. No matter of your cadence, It will only look to heart rate, and will set the power.\n\nPost 11 by Sport_IT_Diederik:\nThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m thinking, the Wattage should not change in the display. Since it does, it could be the smart trainer that is not smart. I have an Elite, don\u2019t know by hard the exact version. Was assuming it would be smart maybe it\u2019s not. It\u2019s working, with or without a correct wattage number.",

It\u2019s working, with or without a correct wattage number. My confusion is that I was anticipating I should see the same wattage, regardless of cadence. Which is what you are saying as well.\n\nPost 12 by R2Tom:\nYeah, but if your heart rate goes up, if you do higher cadence, then it will decrease the power, and then you will see less watts. If your heart rate would stay at the same level with higher cadence, then the watts should also stay at same level. But it depends, whether your heart rate goes up or not. If you would have a dumb trainer , it would show more (!) watts with higher cadence at the same gearing, if it uses a speed/power curve.\n\nPost 13 by MedTechCD:\nTrue again Most riders will have a slightly higher HR when cadence goes up. And it will be more if you are not used to riding higher cadences. For very low cadences as in the SFR workouts, you will put out considerably more power at the same HR. But your legs will fatigue much faster. Within your \u2018comfortable\u2019 cadence range, the HR difference will be minimal. So you probably see a lower power number because your HR goes up with the higher cadence. If you would do similar in an ERG workout with constant power, you will see changes in HR. Higher HR with higher cadence, lower HR with lower cadence. Like I said, it\u2019s a balance of cardiovascular vs muscular load. And what you see in the numbers depends on which variable is being kept constant by the loading system (app + trainer).\n\nPost 14 by Alex:\nHR goes up, we tell the trainer to lower the wattage, this is exactly how it works and should work. If we did not lower the power target then your HR would stay too high. If you want power to stay constant and HR to go up, then use ERG mode As others said torque does not matter in that story it is very simple just HR and power. Your torque goes down when RPM goes up. The trainer controls this automatically, we just provide power target. Your Elite is working perfectly",

So : if I want to do 200W, I can either push hard at a lower cadence, or pedal faster for a lower power output. Outdoors this works exactly like this. When using the brilliant indoor HR based training feature, I\u2019m confused. I put my target HR at 120, which is my zone 2 target HR. I clearly have the natural tendency to cycle at a higher cadence as time moves on. Which to be honest is another great side effect of this form or training. The trainer is adjusting perfectly in the recent version of the app. When the HR goes up, it adjusts the power down and the other way round. that\u2019s the power of the trainer. The part that I don\u2019t understand : when I start cycling faster, this gives a higher load on the cardio system. Which means : the power of the trainer should adjust down. Which is does. But : the show wattage is also going down. I played with it and indeed : when I lower my candence, the watts shown go up\u2026 I\u2019m probably missing something. In my understanding, the watts show should be the same, it should only be the torque power of the trainer that is adjusted \u2026 Trying to understand, the training model works, that\u2019s the most important part\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nI think this is what you meant but to clarify Watts != power X cadence Watts = torque X cadence (this is correct) Let\u2019s say normally in ERG mode (example below) @80 rpm 120watts = 120bpm @90 rpm 120watts = 130bpm (same watts more HR strain) So to reverse that for HR mode 120bpm = 110watts. This is how it should work. That is exact definition of \u201chigher load on the cardio system.\u201d It pushes HR higher but reduces the muscular tension/torque for the same watt output. So you said everything correctly (other than torque/watts), so I am not sure where your confusion is\n\nPost 3 by R2Tom:\nIf you cycle with higher cadence, your heart has to do more work, because you are spinning faster, and therefor the muscle need more oxygen from blood. (=> higher heart rate at same power) If you cycle with lower cadence, then your muscle use more fast twitch fibres and they use more glycogen stored in the muscle, and as a result your heart rate is going down. I think you are confused with power and torque and watts. Your muscle do put some force on the pedals (Unit Newton). To measure the torque you have to multiply force x crank length (=Nm). To get power = torque x cadence (=Nm/s=W) If you change cadence, you have to change torque for same power.\n\nPost 4 by MedTechCD:\nExactly, low cadence puts more strain on the peripheral system (muscles), high cadence puts more strain on the central system (cardiovascular). Your body sort of automatically balances both to get you as far as possible. That\u2019s why almost all cyclists start to grind when fatigued, except for those that have weak peripheral system and strong cardiovascular from x-training.\n\nPost 5 by Sport_IT_Diederik:\nHey Alex, correct, I should have said torque, but that\u2019s what I meant. Let me take the time to do the math\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nWhat math? I was just making up numbers. We have no idea of what RPM is going to cause what additional strain on someone\u2019s cardiovascular system. I am sure that is extremely individual and if it is not we would need to look at thousands of people doing steady state workouts to see if there is any consistent relationship.",

I realize this is an outlier case but it re-iterates the point that higher RPM is not always better. Not to mention in climbing pros tend to be all over the place, some low RPM guys and obviously many higher RPM guys. This is my friend Rich that is ex-pro cyclist also talking about cadence. You have to watch the whole thing to see how he points out \u201cit depends.\u201d I think at the end of the day, riding at your own self-optimized cadence is best for maximum performance today but doing cadence drills from time to time can help your body potentially adjust to a new optimization that is even more efficient.\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nSo I had discussion with Andrea about this. His opinion is race or fast group rides or general cycling should be at your natural cadence but you should do training to try to increase your \u201cnatural cadence.\u201d",

        "text": "Blog Article: No Power Meter on Your Bike? No Problem: Heart Rate Training\n\nPower meters are great especially for short duration higher intensity intervals. But they are not a necessity for training smarter or getting faster. I would argue that many riders would be better off focusing on heart rate. I say this partially because it has been shown that easy rides are a corner stone of performance. Easy and heart rate based training go hand in hand. I would also argue that learning to judge your hard intervals by RPE (rate of perceived exertion) is a valuable step in cycling performance.\n\n![Garmin heart rate monitor cycling](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0fHcGTdsvE4Tmx55l.jpg)\n\nAs recently popularized, there are 3 primary training zones or intensity targets. Easy, moderate and hard. Arguably, breaking it down farther than this is not a critical component to getting faster. Most people do too much moderate and not enough easy and hard. You can google \u201cPolarized Training\u201d to get a better understanding of this.\n\nSo you can use TrainerDay to execute your heart rate based training.

There could be a setting to turn this off for those that don\u2019t want that cluttering their power & HR curves. One way to get a little better match between cadence and HR might be to set the top limit of the HR axis to be the ceiling modulo 10 of the entered max HR. So for me with HRmax = 165, the top of the graph would be 170, with a range of 50 - 170.",

        "text": "Forum Discussion: How to create workouts like Morpheus heart rate suggestions\nCategory: General Discussion\nTopic Type: Training Execution\nPosts: 8\n\nPost 1 by Bdo811:\nIs anyone using a Morpheus heart monitor? They have prescribed zbit training programs that I\u2019m wondering if anyone has made TrainerDay programs for (they are various 60 on 10 off etc) I find it hard to figure out how to pedal to keep up with the changes in the program and before trying to crate the workouts myself wondering if they exist. Thank you\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nThat\u2019s an interesting product. I just did a brief look. It\u2019s a cool idea in general but I need to look at it more. So when you say program in I assume you mean program in HR targets? Right now I want to remove all public workouts (I don\u2019t think there are very many public ones now) with HR targets since we use specific HR not % of threshold or something else. Our workout creator is super fast and you could even use ChatGPT to generate excel spreadsheets possibly and then copy and paste the workouts into our editor (just an idea).\n\nPost 3 by Bdo811:\nThey have a set of workouts for the zone 2 recovery part. They look like this IMG_84091290\u00d72573 126 KB IMG_84101290\u00d72569 226 KB\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nOh that\u2019s a unusual prescription of intervals when talking about heart rate 5-10 second intervals all out. So you should use our slope mode intervals not HR intervals but then you could do ERG to drop the power and then do HR intervals for the recovery and press + button to extend the workout. This is interesting and hard but unusual use of HR. This might require more explanation on how to create this workout as prescribed in TrainerDay but I think you can do a good job of it\u2026 Let me know.\n\nPost 5 by Bdo811:\nIs there a way to program that so that TD mirrors what their app is trying to get you to do?\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nYes but realize for example \u201call out\u201d or as hard as you can is not something you can program, it\u2019s something you must do. You can program very hard in ERG but any particular day you can be stronger or weaker. I will post an example of how to program this.\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nSo there are multiple approaches to how to solve this problem. One is the \u201cperfect\u201d way from a TrainerDay workout creation standpoint which is design the workout exactly true to what they are saying. Like this image image2464\u00d71884 412 KB For the 2 minute HR segment press >> button to extend 2 minutes to what you need it to be during the workout until you get to z2/blue zone (turn on our zones in settings). Next time you can set this to the time you actually need, some people might be 2 minutes some might be 5 minutes. I feel that is a bit complex, I would do it simpler (I can explain a simple workout if you need) Another final way is do it more like outdoors and do it all manually. And just not program it Click on quick start and click slope mode for 1% Warmup watch your HR so it gets to the top of zone 2 Increase slope to about 4-6% Shift gears and go as hard as you can for 10-15 seconds lower slope to 1% or shift down and watch your HR until it gets back to Zone 2,6) Repeat step 3,4,5 - 10+ times cool down\n\nPost 8 by Norsemanfit:\nI found these two workouts worked well with my Morpheus HR targets. 1st one called ( there is no try ) IMG_05401125\u00d72436 175 KB",

Getting a SkiErg delivered very soon. Is there a chance it will already work with TrainerDay, because of the support of RowErg?\nContext: User is expecting delivery of a SkiErg soon.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about SkiErg compatibility with TrainerDay.\nAnswer: I am happy to make it work with SkiERG. I have one other friend/ trainerday user that is supposed to test it. If there is any problems and you are willing to work with us we will make sure it works. Ideally you are an Android user My friend is iOS so that makes it slightly more complicated to fix. I think because we fixed BikeERG and RowERG works skiERG should also.\nSolution: Willingness to make SkiErg work with TrainerDay and request for user testing.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Perfect! I can test from both OS, so no problem. Are you gonna setup a SkiErg profile/activity?\nContext: User offers to test on both Android and iOS.\nUser Problem: Need for a SkiErg profile/activity setup.\nAnswer: Sure, we can do that, so that it posts to strava or other platforms correctly. When you get it let us know if it works in cycling or rowing and if it does we will just add skiERG.\nSolution: Confirmation of setting up a SkiErg profile/activity.",

(To automatically send completed activities to Garmin)\nCategory: Integrations & Export\nTopic Type: Feature Requests\n\nQ&A 1:\nQuestion: Hi Alex, Im new to trainerday and I\u2019m looking for a way to sync the completed workouts to garmin connect. So far one way I have thought this can be done is with RunGap since it allows you to sync different accounts with Garmin and other services. Would it be possible for trainerday to be added to RunGap? This video explains better how this works. Thanks\nContext: User is new to TrainerDay and looking for integration options.\nUser Problem: Need to sync completed workouts to Garmin Connect.\nAnswer: Wow, cool. Let me contact rungap and see what they say. If they are willing to add us.\nSolution: Contacting RunGap for potential integration.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Awesome! Thanks for taking the time. Looking forward for this to happen.\nContext: User expresses appreciation for Alex's efforts.\nUser Problem: Eager for the integration to happen.\nAnswer: Thank you for mentioning it. Many people would like this to happen.\nSolution: Acknowledgment of user interest.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: This already works with a few steps. RunGap can be connected to Dropbox, where it creates two folders, import, and export. TrainerDay can already connect to Dropbox, though as I see it you can not select custom or multiple folders yet. Until then you can use this: Dropbox to Dropbox Sync - IFTTT or another automation process to copy files from the Dropbox Trainerday folder to the Dropbox RunGap Import folder. After that you can manually or automatically upload your Trainerday finished workouts to Garmin, via RunGap. You can even spoof the file, so Garmin thinks it comes from a Garmin device and you can therefore earn badges, etc. @Alex there is one problem though, some files are not correctly formatted, 0\u2019s in the file, aka speed and distance not working like on intervals not long ago - could be only old files, as some newer ones seem to have the data. Did you fix your files or was the fix only made on intervals.icu?\nContext: User describes a workaround for syncing workouts.\nUser Problem: Issues with file formatting and syncing.\nAnswer: Oh interesting. We are working on this direct integration. No we did not fix the zeros in the files but we will work on this too.\nSolution: Working on direct integration and addressing file formatting issues.",

We know if someone cloned a workout, we could remove the clones that are similar, that\u2019s a good idea. TrainerDay does not create workouts except when it is dynamically generated as part of a Coach Jack plan (other than the 20 free workouts and a few random ones). So all workouts are user generated. But I recently recognized that we need to start doing more cleaning of these public workouts. Or somehow make it more clear what public means because people create too many public workouts these days In the beginning we wanted more and more but now we want less So you saying this helps keep it prioritized on my list.\nSolution: Start doing more cleaning of public workouts and clarify what public means.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Hi, Is there a way to avoid soooo many user\u2019s modified workouts on a search?

When I have cycling as the only sport, only cycling workouts should show. If I were to have swimming as the only sport, then I should only see swimming workouts.

Also, I export my workouts to iCloud when I finish. By default, these have the name of the workout (eg \u201c4 x 8 @ 105\u201d). Because I do the same workout multiple times, this means the newest workout will overwrite the last one. It would be helpful to add a date stamp (eg \u201c221227\u201d) to the end of the workout name to avoid this. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d need a time stamp, since I am unlikely to do the same workout twice in one day. It would be extra-cool if I could set up that export to happen automatically when the workout ends.\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nHi, I assume you mean sport in Strava? I know additional technologies is not ideal but why not use Dropbox? Let me think but we should be able to add date to file name.\n\nPost 3 by Postmeister:\nThe files synced to DB already have date and time in the filename\n\nPost 4 by adamrice:\nAlex\u2013 I don\u2019t use Strava, but I do keep copies of my workout files elsewhere, RunGap for one. RunGap can associate equipment with workout type, which is nice for keeping track of usage, but associates \u201cbiking\u201d with my road bike. Not to go on a tirade about Dropbox, but it\u2019s just one more thing to manage, its desktop app is a pig, and iCloud generally does what I need. Postmeister\u2014 I\u2019m talking about file exports. Files are exported with the workout name, not the date. Exporting two files with the same name will overwrite the older one. I repeat workouts, so this becomes a problem.\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nDesktop is a pig. I agree with that, although it may have improved as I don\u2019t notice it anymore but also minimizing the files I have there. We just are small and try to limit stuff that is iOS or Android only when possible. Apple Watch and Ant+ are the two exceptions now. But yes download filename seems possible. Are you doing web or iOS download? Web has speed and distance and we are adding new follow your own route feature but theses are web only. More Strava feature so not likely your interest.\n\nPost 6 by Postmeister:\n@adamrice: Interesting. I didn\u2019t know, that you can export the workouts directly from the app to iCloud. And you are right, these exports have no date and time. But I\u2019ll continue to use DB, because then it uploads automatically to runalyze.com. @Alex: Runalyze also recognises the TD workouts as outdoor rides and not indoor rides. Maybe changing the activity type could help here also.\n\nPost 7 by adamrice:\nAre you doing web or iOS download? When I finish a workout (using the iPad app), I select the finished activity, tap \u201cShare,\u201d use the share sheet to \u201csave to files,\u201d and tap the target directory. Four taps total. So the export workflow is quick and easy, apart from the fact that I need to remember to append a date stamp to the file name. I totally understand not wanting to develop too many platform-specific features.\n\nPost 8 by Alex:\nYep cool. I can add the date to the list. I guess that makes it way better and reasonable compromise I will also work on this cycling vs indoor. Make sense. Funny this is the first time anyone mentioned it. I obviously never paid any attention.\n\nPost 9 by adamrice:\nI noticed you got the date-stamp working on the latest update. I appreciate it.",

Dave\n\nPost 6 by Sport_IT_Diederik:\nWell, I\u2019m looking at a couple of specific Gran Fondos. One of them is the \u201cCol de la Loze\u201d. Which does have something very specific. No matter the side of the climb you take (M\u00e9ribel or Courchevel), the last 6k is where the \u201cfun\u201d begins. (yes, it\u2019s the famous climb where even Pogi bunked a couple of years ago). you are above 2000m and while the first 20k of the climb is \u201conly\u201d around 8%, you suddenly get parts of 20%. After 3 hours of riding and above 2000m. Compare it with Mont Ventoux, the B\u00e9doin side once you get above Chalet Renard. But worse . I\u2019m actually doing the Ventoux this year as well. But anyway, I did this before and had made 2 crucial mistakes: fueling and training preparation. From a fueling point of view, I now know how much carbed up you need to be (no, your stomach doesn\u2019t like that). From a training point of view, this is where my question comes from. btw : to make it even more fun, the last time I did this, it as 30\u00b0 at the top, above 2000m\u2026 hydration was another interesting story\n\nPost 7 by Sport_IT_Diederik:\nI\u2019m experimenting with splitting the intervals. e.g. I used to do a \u201ctuesday SST\u201d that was about an hour, a warmup and the something like to \u201cover-unders\u201d. Now I\u2019m doing a warmup, some SST (let\u2019s say 15-20 minutes), then 30-45 minutes zone 2, and then another block of SST. in the past I would have done the 2 blocks of SST with let\u2019s say 5 minutes in between. I\u2019m spreading it out now. The least I can say is that after \u201cjust\u201d 45 minutes of Z2 indoors, the second interval is \u201cinteresting\u201d",

I would guess a person could do 2 X 5 minutes a week of strength and 2X10 minutes a week of high intensity cardio (5 minutes warmup, maybe something like 10 X 4s with rests) + 2m cool down and get most of the health benefits. Obviously this is not scientific, but just an opinion but after lots of reading and talking to people such as Andrea I believe it is likely. These guys message is mostly marketing but they make lots of claims about the most minimal type of training. carolbike.com The Bike That Gets You Fittest, Fastest\u2014With Workouts Backed by Science |...

However suggesting that Carol ergo is necessary is a marketing trick for public. By chance (thank you Alex for Trainerday) I can use your super easy slope setting and with appropriate tuning generate huge power spike from low RPM to high RPM in 4-5 seconds. Protocol is not set in stone (I see it from cited studies) and connecting HR monitor (and my old Track + Elite TUO) is largely enough.

But a few years ago, there was Nils van der Poel. He came, he trained, and he was victorious. After an Olympic gold medal, he disappeared as quickly as he came. But he left us his training diary for the Olympics, called How to Win the Olympic 10K (the audacity). His training schedule was straightforward. To win the 10k, he needed to skate rounds of 28 seconds, and that was all he did. Skate rounds doing 28 secs. He mixed that win zone 2 200-watt bike workouts. Durability is the counterpart to FTP. For years, young pros were recruited for their high FTPs. But world tour riders don\u2019t just need a high FTP, and many of these young guys failed, mainly because they lacked durability. Meaning, they were strong, but the longer the ride, the weaker they would get. I always analyse the goal with the cyclist. Where is he most likely to get into trouble, or where can he make a difference? That is the specificity I\u2019ll build his training around. Often, a big, long climb has a small part that is so steep that it will drive you to zone 5 or 6. If you are not prepared, you will burn yourself and make the rest of the climb very tough. So even a big climb can need Zone 5 or 6 training. Belgium classics are all about short, intense efforts. Gran Fondo Les Trois Ballons ends at La Planche des Belles Filles, where even the pros need to get out of the saddle to drag themselves over the finish line. I think what Alex says is very important. If you are training for a Grand Fondo, you\u2019ll need to ride long hours. I recommend at least 80% of your expected finish time.\n\nPost 5 by dthrog00:\nSport_IT_Diederik: What are \u201cbest practices\u201d if you have 1-1h30 during weekdays (most of if indoors) and longer rides in the weekend?

Is time in zone per week key or is the development of the VO2 (slow component) much better in longer workouts? For me it is much easier to fit shorter workouts into my day but do them more frequently. Furthermore, my fatigue seems to be better when doing many shorter workouts. Is there any science on it that is concerned about arhletes? I could only find that for untrained and obese people many short workouts are beneficial. Longer rides on the weekend in the aerobic domain are included in weekly training.",

I recently started looking into the concept of \u201cdurability\u201d. A rather hot topic in cycling now. For the pros, it makes the difference between winning and being dropped. For us mere mortals, it makes the difference doing Gran Fondos that end with a big climb\u2026 Now the \u201csimple\u201d advice is : go out and ride 3 hours each day in Z2, complimented with some other harder stuff. Which is pretty much the summary of a modern pro rider training schedule. For which most of us don\u2019t have the time\u2026 What are \u201cbest practices\u201d if you have 1-1h30 during weekdays (most of if indoors) and longer rides in the weekend? I\u2019m experimenting a bit\u2026 Instead of doing 4 HIIT intervals after eachother, I\u2019m doing 20 min of easy warmup, 2 HITT interval blocks, 45 minutes of Z2, then another 2 intervals and then cooldown. I also tried to do 60 min of Z2 first and then 4 interval blocks but euh\u2026 that was funny\u2026 didn\u2019t really work out. Which shows exactly the concept of durability, because I can do these 4 interval 'fresh\" \u2026 Any suggestions ?\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nGood question. I think the term is new enough that I am not sure it is fully agreed upon (or maybe it is) but I see it more as the idea to be able to handle your goal/duration intensities without falling apart\u2026 Meaning if your goal is Gran Fondo\u2019s you should build durability that supports that. Which generally means lower tempo durability for most people. If you plan on keeping in the draft and you know there will be climbs that you might struggle to hold on, it might be durability of those climbs. I see HIIT as mostly the opposite of durability. I also see the logical progression of longer and longer intervals as the smartest way to increase durability. So what stops you from reaching your goals. Mental durability, (don\u2019t like suffering) well maybe practice some suffering So I see this more as a new buzz word closely related to specificity although I like it, it brings out clarity. Let\u2019s say you believe you can do a normalized power of 150w for a 7 hour gran fondo but it will be very hard\u2026 My believe is doing lots of 2 hour 130-140w rides could get you there without too much suffering. Instead of trying to do shorter intervals of 180w\u2026 Although depending on your personal weakness in durability it\u2019s hard to say what is optimum for you. I don\u2019t know if this is all the most efficient training but to me it encompasses \u201cdurability.\u201d Which I would prioritize duration over increased intensity.\n\nPost 3 by MedTechCD:\nMostly agree with @Alex .

W\u2019 won\u2019t tell you anything. Even though over-unders like these below have an anaerobic component, they are primarily aerobic. W\u2019 can not predict the difficulty in these. It\u2019s probably obvious, but we call them over-unders because they are a little over FTP and a little under. You can play with the percentages above and below as you like.\n\n**Over-Unders\u200a\u2014**\u200aMost top coaches recommend starting on the easier side of hard workouts and working your way up. Micro-damage creates gains much faster than too-hard of efforts. Too hard of efforts frequently requires too much recovery, which slows your progress. Really, about a total of 20\u201330 minutes of work is about as long as top coaches recommend or that sane people complete (including the pros). These workouts below are a total of 9-minutes. Start with these, clone them, and each week make the work-intervals a little longer.\n\nIf you have not done over-unders this is an excellent place to start.

        "text": "Blog Article: Designing The Perfect Interval Workout Using W'bal\n\n#### Starting with Progressive Overload\n\nAs most of you likely know, one of the key fundamentals of exercise is progressive overload. This means if you want to get stronger you need to go to failure or at least close to failure to tell your body it needs to repair itself and get stronger so next time this same exercise is easy.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0xYyOCvibyEmEczap.jpg)\n\n### How many intervals should I be\u00a0doing?\n\nEveryone knows that they have a limited amount of time, that they can sustain a hard-effort. We can clarify hard-effort as anything above your FTP. But how much time is that exactly? Meaning should I do four 2-minutes intervals @ 120% or maybe they should be 2:15 not 2-minutes. Since each athlete has a unique amount of anaerobic capacity (W\u2019). You should train with custom intervals matched to your personal W\u2019. You can hunt by trial and error, or you can use this cool TrainerDay feature called W\u2019 Balance (W\u2019Bal). This same feature has been in GoldenCheetah for a long time, but we feel we simplified it.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0ysY46bOrDhfas0UX.jpg)\n\n### Finding the perfect interval\u00a0workouts\n\nThis is a fairly deep subject but just starting with the basics is a huge step forward and something that many workout authors overlook. So for this article we are talking about intervals above your FTP. You want to tax your anaerobic system with just the right stimulus.\n\nThe basic idea is when you are above FTP your anaerobic work capacity (AWC or W\u2019) diminishes. Many people also call this \u201cburning matches.\u201d You only have so many matches to burn. Although when you drop below your FTP your W\u2019 recovers, or the match book fills back up, slowly. The great news is we have added W\u2019Bal to our workout creator.\n\n### 5000+ Is Too Many\u00a0Choices\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0WVmL4pI8fTbu_xpU.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0aQCWEwrcemsHW-_X.png)\n\nI would like to point out, I don\u2019t feel a 10-minute warm-up is enough, it should be closer to 20. It just improved the visibility in this example.\n\n### How to use the W\u2019Bal Calculator\n\nTurn on the W\u2019Bal feature. Enter your FTP or if you know it your CP in the CP box. Enter your W\u2019 ([how to calculate](https://trainerday.com/how-to-calculate-your-critical-power-cp-and-w/)) and you are good to go.\n\nThe red line shows you\u2019re predicted remaining energy and you can see at the end of this set of intervals your remaining energy is at the bottom this W\u2019Bal predicts you are completly fatigued at the end of the intervals. Perfect.\n\nMany scientific studies have proven the validity of these formulas.\n\nIn this example on the left, if you have a W\u2019 of 20kJ, and a FTP of 200, with those intervals, you will burn all your matches. The interesting thing is if you had a 300w FTP, you could not complete this workout (read [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|this article]] to find out why). Another benefit is that designing workouts that you know you should be able to finish can help inspire you to push a little farther. If you make this last interval a little farther and you can finish it (i.e. you can go below zero) that frequently means your W\u2019 or possibly FTP is likely a little higher than you thought.",

What I don\u2019t get yet how to solve is how can I combine the two activities that I have recorded via TD (for power, speed etc) and via garmin watch (for other details on hr data).

If it has broadcast HR over BLE feature you can just connect your watch to our app and have all the data in a single file. I think merging would not be possible or at least not be easy enough you would want to do it at the same time. The other option is connect your trainer or power meter also to your watch and record the workout with power and hr in your watch.\nSolution: Connect watch to app for data in a single file; merging may not be easy\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: Hi @Alex, is it possibile to connect the watch to your app?

So sorry but it seems to be your device or a 6a problem. I guess A14 is out, but that is a risk it will break everything image1268\u00d71794 490 KB\n\nPost 11 by dduffey:\nThank you Alex, I noticed that Android 14 just dropped as well, so I updated it, there is good news/bad news. Out of the box it still has connection issues when switching between apps, but a few bluetooth toggles will get them to connect. Which device doesn\u2019t connect seems to be random (and not a specific device, although I guess a specific device could be causing some issue affecting other devices). I also checked the value of the \u201crobust caching client\u201d and found that it was \u201cnull\u201d by default (and didn\u2019t try changig it) after the Android 14 update. So it does appear A14 works better out of the box than A13 for me. In short, not sure what is going on, at some point I may factory reset the phone to see if that helps but for now you can consider this closed as I am okay toggling the bluetooth on/off a few times. I am still happy to provide logs if wanted. Thanks again for taking a look at this and trying to reproduce it.\n\nPost 12 by Alex:\nThanks for the update. We don\u2019t need the logs at this point but if you get any other ideas please let us know.\n\nPost 13 by dduffey:\nAn update, I did a complete factory reset to the latest Android 14 (October 2023), without restoring any data (so completely default settings) and didn\u2019t make any customizations or enable developer modes. I did install the Tesla and Rivian Bluetooth key apps, which are non-optional for me (but has me wondering if they are causing issues). Unfortunately TD still fails to find all the sensors, and it\u2019s bake to the original behavior that it is rare if they do connect. Out of curiosity (after testing TD) I also installed another HRM ERG app, and it took failed to reliably connect to all devices, so it doesn\u2019t appear to be a trainer day specific issue. So, it may be specific to my phone, my apps (Rivian and Tesla), the Pixel 6a, and/or recent Android updates. (Would be nice to know if there are other Pixel 6a Android 14 users that do/don\u2019t have this issue). I\u2019ll test removing the Tesla/Rivian apps at some future date and will update this thread.\n\nPost 14 by Alex:\nSorry to hear, one solution might be to use an Ant+ dongle. I have the Garmin one but can\u2019t remember if it works with my Pixel6 or not.\n\nPost 15 by MedTechCD:\nYou probably tested but just to make sure that it wasn\u2019t overlooked: Locations service must be enabled to connect to any BLE sensor. If location service is blocked, you will not be able to connect.",

I made yesterday my first workout. My HT is in the garage without internet connection. When wrkout ifnished, I saved it in th app (android). It appear in the activities list in the app. But it doesn\u2019t appear in the activty list in the website, nor in the activity list in my other phone (connected to internet), even after my phone is back at home with access to internet to sync\u2026 I made a second workout with the same app, BUT waited to be back at home with internet access active to save the workout in the app. This way, it sync with the internet TR site but not with Strava, despite Strava seems to be well authorized as the activity list on the TR website as synced ALL my old activities registred in Strava (and Strava say that TR is authorized). So why the android app doesn\u2019t never sync with TR or strava when workout saved without internet access (even after internet access reestablished when I\u2019m back at home) why Strava doesn\u2019t receive the workout even if it appear in the TR activity list in the website, and with TR receiving workout from Strava ? Thanks PS the whole app and integration with Saris H2 and HR belt is ok and very nice.\nContext: User is new to the platform and has experienced issues with syncing workouts.\nUser Problem: Workouts saved without internet do not sync with TrainerDay or Strava.\nAnswer: Hmmm, strange, there is a strava sync button on the web site on the activities page. Press that. Offline does not / should not matter. You are saying TR, I assume you mean TD. I am stlightly confused.\nSolution: Press the Strava sync button on the website.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thanks for quick response. Sorry, I\u2019m TD, not TR (i\u2019m coming from TrainerRoad\u2026). I\u2019ve pushed the strava sync button many time, but doesn\u2019t sync. In the app, when I save the workout without connection, the SHARE page stay empty even when I connect to internet, but when I wait to have intenret to save the workout, the SHARE page is populated with a picture of the workout (if t can help to diagnosic !).\nContext: User clarifies they are using TrainerDay and describes the behavior of the app.\nUser Problem: Strava sync button does not work as expected.\nAnswer: Oh yes, you can\u2019t share without internet. Ok we will research why yours won\u2019t sync. Hopefully get back to you today.\nSolution: Research the syncing issue.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: OK. I\u2019ve lost the worjout of yesterday (1h) due to have saved without active internet connection. I\u2019l do a 3 minute stest now to see if it sync with Strava\nContext: User mentions losing a workout and plans to test again.\nUser Problem: Lost workout due to saving without internet.\nAnswer: Do you see it in you phone? If so you should be able to download it. It should automatically sync from phone to our app (even when offline after you get online). You are saying it did not?\nSolution: Check if the workout is visible on the phone and can be downloaded.\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: So it sync with the 3 minutes test (saving the workout with an active internet connection). I\u2019ll do more test saving without active internet and tell you if this specific problem continue. Thanks for quick response and I\u2019m very happy with the app !\nContext: User reports success with a test and expresses satisfaction.\nUser Problem: Continuing to test the syncing issue.\nAnswer: Cool, yes let me know.

Perhaps is a better option than doing it based on FTP% thanks again for your guidance\n\nPost 6 by dthrog00:\nCesar_Nunez: I don\u2019t know how the slope feature works. Slope means your trainer is going to apply resistance that matches a grade. If you tell it 5% it is like you are going up a 5% hill. Dave\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nSo we don\u2019t have any perfect solution for this, but really all you are talking about is specific power targets in specific places on your route. The best way to do this in general is to focus on the climbs or just a few key targets on the route. Then use either our editor or in Garmin connect you can set specific distances and ours you can not. But I would avoid distances and times completely and just use open ended which means you start the workout\u2026 When you get to your first climb you press the lap button and it will go to your target watts. See below how to do that in our tool image1536\u00d7950 49.9 KB See below Garmin\u2019s workout creator. You could use distances just for the climbs for example. Or specific areas. image1330\u00d7836 36.8 KB You can find the distance in ridewithgps workout creator for example. But I am sure garmin route creator or any of them you can.\n\nPost 8 by Cesar_Nunez:\nthanks for the tips I think the easier way to do it in my case is just by creating a new screen in my Garmin Computer showing just FTP% and cadence; by the time I hit a climb, I can shift to reach my target FTP% within a cadence range\n\nPost 9 by Alex:\nYes, exactly, this is perfect unless it is too much to remember, meaning different targets on different slopes. In which case you can also do old school and just use top tube sticker\n\nPost 10 by Robert_UCL:\nHi Cesar, It sounds like a great concept, but in reality, this is almost impossible. Suppose you could create such a file. If tomorrow\u2019s weather brings you a strong headwind, it will take you much longer to ride the same route. Or maybe our body isn\u2019t as fit as usual, because you didn\u2019t sleep well. Or maybe there is more traffic on the route, slowing you down. These factors, which you can\u2019t control, will bring a lot of stress to do things right. Alex\u2019s suggestion of using the lap button for the sections that matter is great. Part of training outdoors is adjusting to the freedom of the road, trying to enjoy the environment, while taking advantage of the challenges your route brings you. The way I do that is by looking at how long certain sections usually take and finding a specific workout for this section. Sometimes I adjust the workout so it fits perfectly into my situation. Where I live, everything is flat. I can ride 200km with only 100am. For strength training on the bike, I use a tunnel nearby. It is a 300m climb with an 8% gradient. That takes me about 30secs with 60rpm. I ride down and do the same again. It is the most boring workout I have in my library, but it works. The upside is that the tunnel is cool in summer and provides shelter from the wind, so it isn\u2019t really cold in winter. Another example is a route that I like at about an hour, by car, from home. There is a climb which is about one 1km long with an average gradient of 7,7%. The start and the end are 3-4 % and the rest is 12-14%. The nice part is that I turn left at the top, and the road leads me back to the base of the same climb. It is a great climb for either a long zone 5 interval or a short zone 4 interval.",

Trainer Day - Activity Detail Amazing experience. The only minor feedback I would give is that the ramp up of HR within a session is a bit on the slow side. image892\u00d7245 51.3 KB See the red circle. When you start a workout, it\u2019s fine to have a 5 min \u201cramp\u201d to your target HR. I tried it within a session, it works (which is super!), but potentially a future change that if you are within a session, the power can ramp up faster. Next session I will experiment a bit with first using ERG to bring up the HR faster and then switch to HR mode for a longer block. The switching is perfect now.\n\nPost 9 by Alex:\nYes, that ramp up in session needs to be improved. That is my next improvement with this. I am not exactly sure how I want to do it yet. It would be ideal to predict what your power should be and jump quickly to that point (1 jump or a couple), but maybe just doubling the speed after 20 minutes into the workout would be enough. Now there is a work around. If you know approximately what your target power will be, then you create a 20-30 second ERG ramp, or block of the right power then HR mode will start at the right point.\n\nPost 10 by MedTechCD:\nAlex: It would be ideal to predict what your power should be Why not create a slow ramp test within the aerobic zone and use the slope of the result to steer the power during HR sessions? The app could get that result from the riders history, taking the most recent slow ramp test result. HR will only be usable for sessions within the aerobic zone, about 10 bpm below AeT (MAF) and around 5 bpm below AT. HR and power have a linear relationship in that zone. All you need is the slope of that linear relationship and predictability will be quite high. Then let your algo fine tune. Here\u2019s a screenshot in Intervals of my 9 week base period. You can clearly see the linear relation HR/Power from approximately 105 - 140 bpm. image740\u00d7640 28.4 KB\n\nPost 11 by Alex:\nMy experience shows there can be a big difference from one day to the next and from a \u201cperfect ramp\u201d to an actual workout, for example post higher intensity like in his example but still we could probably look at current workout, see if how power/hr looks compared to the ramp and adjust from there and target about 10% under and let the HR feature make up the difference. Even just take a FTP ramp test and pull the data for this ramp. It\u2019s a good idea in general. Easier than anything I thought of\n\nPost 12 by MedTechCD:\nI agree that the absolute values change day by day. But the slope of the relationship gives you a value Watts/beat. That slope will not change very much. On changes from one interval to the next, you can use that as a starting point. 10 beats higher for the next interval will then be an adjustment of 10 x watts/beat.",

The ability to customise plans etc is streets ahead of trainer road so great job there.\n\nPost 12 by Alex:\nThanks so much. Yes as you say, actually as you get stronger zone 2 power is not easy. As your aerobic fitness improves significantly even the top of zone 2 heart rate is not so easy. Dr Maffetone and the 7X iornman winner Mark Allen pointed out that when he got to peak fat / aerobic adaption he was doing zone 2 HR intervals as they were hard and he did not feel like keeping in zone 2 non-stop. Andrea points out for pros zone 2 is real work. It\u2019s important to clarify that Dr. Seiler\u2019s definition of easy is below AeT (aerobic threshold), determinine your AeT base on HR is the key point. For a lot of people that is closer to 65% of power but might even be 60%. That will improve over time as you get more and more aerobic / fat adapted. If you eat pre-meal carbs that will shoot your HR up and start buring glycogen immediately so that you end up training at a lower power intensity. If you can burn mostly fat then your HR stays lower, power goes up and it gets much harder.\n\nPost 13 by Alex:\nA post was split to a new message: Allow searching CJ workouts from my plan\n\nPost 14 by arthurdaly:\nAlex: So I did not explain the problem of why we only allow #10 now.

The problem that I have seen is that when setting a target in resistance mode (and I assume slope mode is the same) it can\u2019t really be connected to watts. We could do it kind of like power match feature but that would be a bit of a mess and complicated. Meaning look at the target slope, read the current watts and then try to adjust the slope to get it to the watts. That would require some hunting around. I think a user would almost need to create special workouts just for this slope mode because each trainer and gearing would produce different watt outputs for specific slopes. So you could create a workout with a warmup of 1% slope, followed by a threshold 8% slope and back to a 1% slope for a cool down. Now that 8% slope would not actually be 100% of FTP it would just increase the resistance and get it in the ball park but the user creating the workout and doing the ride would have to fine tune this. Sadly although I like the idea this is getting uglier\u2026 I am still not apposed to it as I think it might be interesting and once we do slope mode might be easy to implement. I do like the training effect. I might personally use this instead of ERG for harder efforts. Alternatively maybe we could just imporve our slope mode with giant buttons to increase. Maybe two levels of buttons. + 5% or + 1%. Just the idea I mean Not real obviously image694\u00d7623 39.9 KB\n\nPost 14 by Alex:\nMaybe there is a way to estimate power. We have the formula to convert incline % + weight + power to speed. So we know how much power it takes to maintain a specific speed up a specific incline %. So a 30w increase in power would be approximately Y% for a new slope at the same speed. And if it is too much, you slow down\u2026 I think that might work\u2026\n\nPost 15 by HighSpeed:\nSounds good Alex. Slope mode as you describe it is really all that\u2019s needed. Give me slope resistance and I can do hard sprint intervals. That is what is missing with Erg mode. Determination of slope from %FTP will only be an estimate of possible watts because you can\u2019t be sure how fast I will pedal. The important part is to preserve the ratios for %FTP values in the workout. If 100% FTP maps to 10% slope, 50% FTP should map to 5% and 200% FTP should map to 20%. You can then use the -/+ controls to consistently scale the resistance level across the entire workout. Cheers!\n\nPost 16 by Alex:\nYes now you are thinking like me. Meaning that is the simple approach (50=5%\u2026). And have you tried our resistance mode (free-ride) and the problem is that the resistance mode is too flat and does not feel like slope mode? What trainer are you using now?\n\nPost 17 by HighSpeed:\nThis might help. Here is a workout I created on my NordicTrack bike. You define only \u201cincline%\u201d for each interval block. The bike then responds with a different calculated resistance force for each interval during the workout. While pedalling, you can modify the overall resistance using the +/- control that changes the relative resistance level for each interval . + makes each interval harder. - makes them easier. This means you can share a workout with riders with different strength levels. Each rider sees the same changes during the workout. They select their personal level of resistance with the -/+ control. nt3130\u00d7900 390 KB\n\nPost 18 by HighSpeed:\nMy trainer is the Stages SB20 Smart Bike.",

What if a new workout defaults to the same mode you ended the last workout in. Does that solve your issue? I know there are more and more slope moders and I believe most stay in slope mode the whole time so this should work well. So if a person builds a custom workout in our platform then it can set it to start with slope mode but in your case with WOD, that won\u2019t work\u2026 So if the workout does not specify it (like WOD workouts) we could just start with your last session.\n\nPost 8 by Pbase:\nHey Alex, that would be awesome.

For example if I want to do a relatively hard VO2max #17 or #18, I have to generate a plan that is long enough (with a peak block) or try to search if someone in the community already copied and saved it for others. Sometimes that is the case but in most scenarios I create a (dummy) plan to get a specific workout. I hope you understand what I\u2019m trying to say? If there is already a similar request: Sorry but I didn\u2019t see that and thus you can close this thread! Best regards, Stephan\nUser Problem: Need to generate specific workouts without creating a full training plan.\nAnswer: No, this is the first of this request like this. I fully understand the \u201cwhat\u201d you are requesting but I don\u2019t necessary understand the why or how you plan to use it. If you just want to make some VO2max intervals this is super inside our app for training inside the app. But if you want to use it in another system that does not help. You can see that feature here What we could do is create a feature from My Plans, to convert to list, and then you could take a whole 6-22 and convert it to a list and just grab from that list any time, if you are not following a plan in our calendar you could set a my plans to active and grab any workout out want in our app\u2026 I guess I am also asking why a CJ workout? Meaning because in general it\u2019s hard to search/find a specific number of intervals or because you are following a CJ plan and want to repeat something or another reason? Maybe this feature in the app would be enough if you could just send it to another platform\u2026 I am not opposed to your idea or let\u2019s say I like it, just trying to understand.\nSolution: Potential feature to convert workouts to a list for easier access.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thanks for your detailed answer. The reason why I am asking this is that I \u201cdynamically\u201d changed the length of my training plan. First I had a plan with one single event in April. Thus I\u2019m now in the peak block with demanding intervals like VO2max #16 or similar. When I\u2019m now extending my plan to let\u2019s say June the blocks get stretched or rather it\u2019s switching to a base block where a peak block was before. Thus I\u2019m not able to go one with my hard intervals (VO2max #17, #18 etc. for example) but instead have VO2max #7 or something like that instead. To put it in other words: What should I do if I extend my plan and thus the blocks got stretched and shifted (maybe kind of a newbie question because I got now professionell background)?\nUser Problem: Difficulty managing training plan adjustments and maintaining hard intervals.\nAnswer: Got it: The primary event date should not be changed and everything should be build around that. I don\u2019t know why the primaery event date also shifted but now I\u2019m aware of that.\nSolution: Maintain the primary event date to avoid shifting blocks.",

For example if I want to do a relatively hard VO2max #17 or #18, I have to generate a plan that is long enough (with a peak block) or try to search if someone in the community already copied and saved it for others. Sometimes that is the case but in most scenarios I create a (dummy) plan to get a specific workout. I hope you understand what I\u2019m trying to say? If there is already a similar request: Sorry but I didn\u2019t see that and thus you can close this thread! Best regards, Stephan\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nNo, this is the first of this request like this. I fully understand the \u201cwhat\u201d you are requesting but I don\u2019t necessary understand the why or how you plan to use it. If you just want to make some VO2max intervals this is super inside our app for training inside the app. But if you want to use it in another system that does not help. You can see that feature here What we could do is create a feature from My Plans, to convert to list, and then you could take a whole 6-22 and convert it to a list and just grab from that list any time, if you are not following a plan in our calendar you could set a my plans to active and grab any workout out want in our app\u2026 I guess I am also asking why a CJ workout? Meaning because in general it\u2019s hard to search/find a specific number of intervals or because you are following a CJ plan and want to repeat something or another reason? Maybe this feature in the app would be enough if you could just send it to another platform\u2026 I am not opposed to your idea or let\u2019s say I like it, just trying to understand.\n\nPost 3 by SteveFX:\nThanks for your detailed answer. The reason why I am asking this is that I \u201cdynamically\u201d changed the length of my training plan. First I had a plan with one single event in April. Thus I\u2019m now in the peak block with demanding intervals like VO2max #16 or similar. When I\u2019m now extending my plan to let\u2019s say June the blocks get stretched or rather it\u2019s switching to a base block where a peak block was before. Thus I\u2019m not able to go one with my hard intervals (VO2max #17, #18 etc. for example) but instead have VO2max #7 or something like that instead. To put it in other words: What should I do if I extend my plan and thus the blocks got stretched and shifted (maybe kind of a newbie question because I got now professionell background)?\n\nPost 4 by SteveFX:\nGot it: The primary event date should not be changed and everything should be build around that. I don\u2019t know why the primaery event date also shifted but now I\u2019m aware of that. PS: I also realised how nice the feature of adding intervals on the fly is: Just adding VO2max intervals when I\u2019m feeling great to push it really hard on my hard intervals Monday!",

Once you do this you come to TrainerDay connections page under settings and you can connect to TrainingPeaks.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0bb6opA-UpeVi9Gta.png)\n\nOnce this is done the rest is easy. Just find any workout or plan and send it to TrainingPeaks. With plans you should have a Premium TrainingPeaks account or the whole plan will go on a single day. But one easy thing to do is each day you want to train. Find your workout and click send to TrainingPeaks and in 30 seconds or less you can see it in they training platform of your choice.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0_Ea78aE9khMEDcp7.png)\n\nOther options for using TrainingPeaks are what is called WOD.

But they are not a necessity for training smarter or getting faster. I would argue that many riders would be better off focusing on heart rate. I say this partially because it has been shown that easy rides are a corner stone of performance. Easy and heart rate based training go hand in hand. I would also argue that learning to judge your hard intervals by RPE (rate of perceived exertion) is a valuable step in cycling performance.\n\n![Garmin heart rate monitor cycling](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0fHcGTdsvE4Tmx55l.jpg)\n\nAs recently popularized, there are 3 primary training zones or intensity targets. Easy, moderate and hard. Arguably, breaking it down farther than this is not a critical component to getting faster. Most people do too much moderate and not enough easy and hard. You can google \u201cPolarized Training\u201d to get a better understanding of this.\n\nSo you can use TrainerDay to execute your heart rate based training. Using our calendar and converting Coach Jack workouts or for that matter any workouts to heart rate based workout is simple.\n\nSee below where you can click and convert any of our thousands of power based workouts to heart rate based workouts.\n\n![TrainerDay calendar\u200a\u2014\u200aheart rate training](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1lu6REHML_Rpe1WUZ-LCEAw.png)\n\nYou can also just search and find workouts and send them to the platform of your choice to perform heart rate based workouts.\n\n![Send heart rate based workout to TrainingPeaks](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1hdzp6glEjvyBJIUsTp9nHw.png)\n\nIf you train with power some times (for example indoors) and have a feeling of what Zone 3 should feel like.

        "text": "Blog Article: Designing The Perfect Interval Workout Using W'bal\n\n#### Starting with Progressive Overload\n\nAs most of you likely know, one of the key fundamentals of exercise is progressive overload. This means if you want to get stronger you need to go to failure or at least close to failure to tell your body it needs to repair itself and get stronger so next time this same exercise is easy.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0xYyOCvibyEmEczap.jpg)\n\n### How many intervals should I be\u00a0doing?\n\nEveryone knows that they have a limited amount of time, that they can sustain a hard-effort. We can clarify hard-effort as anything above your FTP. But how much time is that exactly? Meaning should I do four 2-minutes intervals @ 120% or maybe they should be 2:15 not 2-minutes. Since each athlete has a unique amount of anaerobic capacity (W\u2019). You should train with custom intervals matched to your personal W\u2019. You can hunt by trial and error, or you can use this cool TrainerDay feature called W\u2019 Balance (W\u2019Bal). This same feature has been in GoldenCheetah for a long time, but we feel we simplified it.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0ysY46bOrDhfas0UX.jpg)\n\n### Finding the perfect interval\u00a0workouts\n\nThis is a fairly deep subject but just starting with the basics is a huge step forward and something that many workout authors overlook. So for this article we are talking about intervals above your FTP. You want to tax your anaerobic system with just the right stimulus.\n\nThe basic idea is when you are above FTP your anaerobic work capacity (AWC or W\u2019) diminishes. Many people also call this \u201cburning matches.\u201d You only have so many matches to burn. Although when you drop below your FTP your W\u2019 recovers, or the match book fills back up, slowly. The great news is we have added W\u2019Bal to our workout creator.\n\n### 5000+ Is Too Many\u00a0Choices\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0WVmL4pI8fTbu_xpU.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0aQCWEwrcemsHW-_X.png)\n\nI would like to point out, I don\u2019t feel a 10-minute warm-up is enough, it should be closer to 20. It just improved the visibility in this example.\n\n### How to use the W\u2019Bal Calculator\n\nTurn on the W\u2019Bal feature. Enter your FTP or if you know it your CP in the CP box. Enter your W\u2019 ([how to calculate](https://trainerday.com/how-to-calculate-your-critical-power-cp-and-w/)) and you are good to go.\n\nThe red line shows you\u2019re predicted remaining energy and you can see at the end of this set of intervals your remaining energy is at the bottom this W\u2019Bal predicts you are completly fatigued at the end of the intervals. Perfect.\n\nMany scientific studies have proven the validity of these formulas.\n\nIn this example on the left, if you have a W\u2019 of 20kJ, and a FTP of 200, with those intervals, you will burn all your matches. The interesting thing is if you had a 300w FTP, you could not complete this workout (read [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|this article]] to find out why). Another benefit is that designing workouts that you know you should be able to finish can help inspire you to push a little farther. If you make this last interval a little farther and you can finish it (i.e. you can go below zero) that frequently means your W\u2019 or possibly FTP is likely a little higher than you thought.",

You can easily add a week, delete a week, add workouts from your library or add Coach Jack or other training plans.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-18SnBAi6C3v2DH1eRk92ocw.png)\n\nYou can sync this calendar to Garmin and Training Peaks, which is especially valuable if you use our Coach Jack plans. You can quickly edit your CJ plan in the plan builder and it will automatically re-sync to where you need it. Also you can read [[2023-01-01-no-power-meter-on-your-bike-no-problem-heart-rate-training-b901c7a11c06.md|here]], but converting workouts to HR instead of power is a breeze as well.",

We don\u2019t have direct Zwift integration but if we added this to the app it would make it easy to just open our app, see your next planned workout and click send to TrainingPeaks and it would sync to Zwift. We don\u2019t have direct Zwift integration so it is either via TrainingPeaks (free if you are only sending today\u2019s workout there, or paid if you want to send wokouts in the future). You can do this now on our web site but doing it in the app with the ability to make a workout as completed or doing some in our app and some in zwift makes total sense to me. Let me know if that is a clear answer or not Also let me know if that would help you. Maybe just doing it from our site is enough? It\u2019s mobile friendly\nSolution: Use TrainingPeaks to sync workouts to Zwift\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Would that be possible to add this @Alex ?

Do you happen to have a link to that video? I can research it even if not but it would help to see it.\nSolution: Request for video link to explore the solution\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Best if there was a direct link between TrainerDay and Zwift rather than having to go via TP\u2019s.\nUser Problem: Frustration with needing to use TrainingPeaks\nAnswer: I tried to get this but Zwift does not allow it. It\u2019s easy with free version of TrainingPeaks. I hope in the future Zwift creates public api\nSolution: Currently not possible due to Zwift's restrictions\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: Now that Zwift has made their API public/semi-public are there plans to leverage and push workouts to Zwift?\nContext: User references other platforms that have integrated with Zwift\nUser Problem: Curiosity about future integration capabilities\nAnswer: We will do it ASAP when they let us. We keep requesting it but they are slowly adding companies.\nSolution: Plans to integrate once Zwift allows it",

My current workflow is to upload the TrainerDay ride-file from my Dropbox or (because I prefer to have these false map, distance and speed ;-)) download the original file from Strava and upload it to runalyze. It would be great to have an integration with runalyze in the app, so that the rides will automatically upload (like Strava and TP). Maybe you can contact them via support@runalyze.com\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nCool, I love it that some many people want these fake distances\u2026 Meaning I love that people have their own individuality. I think I am going to add the fake data to both dropbox and training peaks, seems too many people want it. You can do this automatically using fitness syncer (dropbox or strava to runalizer). I doubt that we will do a direct integration, at least not until we are really big fitnesssyncer.com FitnessSyncer Runalyze FAQ\n\nPost 3 by Alex:\nPS do you like these fake maps too? Do you want them in dropbox? My fear is if you add the classic climbs your distance will be really low and I think most people want longer distances.\n\nPost 4 by Postmeister:\nI know it\u2018s weird, but I do like the maps If you could include them in dropbox it would be great. Currently I have Fun Routes, Climbs and Interesting Places turned on and today it was a relatively flat course with 69 m elevation gain. So it\u2018s not always the big climbs. But generally you\u2018re right, I\u2018d prefer more distance over more elevation gain.\n\nPost 5 by Cyclopaat:\nIf I compare my \u2018flat\u2019 Tacx recorded (via the Tacx app) rides, to the virtual ones I do on BigRingVR or Tacx TDA/TTS, I\u2019d probably have easily passed the 25-27.5K km mark for this year already, instead of the 20K where I am now\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nCool, I am really happy you like them. I like them too. I am not so worried about distance so the map is cool. You can turn off climbs and you will only get flat routes and get more distance that way.\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nYes this could be a service, a virtual ride route flattner we kind of like Tapiirik with a flattner service to give you more distance.\n\nPost 8 by Cyclopaat:\nI already have that. This from the Tacx app controlling the Neo, while I was virtually riding Eikedalen on BigRingVR. This is a relatively minor distance deficit, but on long climbs, it can be 25 km climb - 65 km \u2018flat\u2019, or something like that. Screenshot 2020-11-23 at 16.58.383496\u00d7200 48.8 KB On Strava, I only log the virtual rides, also because they have segments. Well, you can\u2019t make those anymore on new rides (or at least only private ones), but I hope they will reinstate that feature for parties like BigRingVR to create official segments and no \u2018Your Mom Smells Like Donuts\u2019 crap.\n\nPost 9 by Postmeister:\nPostmeister: It would be great to have an integration with runalyze in the app, so that the rides will automatically upload (like Strava and TP). This request was solved this week, when runalyze.com added automatic dropbox imports. Now my rides are automatically imported to runalyze.com from the TD dropbox folder. Currently it\u2019s in beta for supporters and premium users only, but I think it will be available shortly also for free users. Finally I no longer need Strava for anything",

        "text": "Blog Article: Free Ride And Open Ended Intervals Garmin Zwift\n\n### Garmin Open Ended Intervals\n\nOpen-ended intervals means it will just keep going until you hit the lap button on your Garmin unit. If you add fr or free-ride to the interval type in our editor you will get Open-Ended workouts on your Garmin device. You must still include an amount of time for this. Generally I would put a time similar to what you think you might do.\n\nYou can push to Garmin or push to TrainingPeaks and this open-ended feature will work. One secret trick is if you put 60% in the target FTP% then it will actually show a target of 40\u2013100% on your Garmin meaning it really is a free ride.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0zawJbn2W3DGKdZy4.png)\n\n### Zwift\u200a\u2014\u200aFree\u00a0Ride\n\nAlthough Free-Ride and open ended are different concepts, I would argue the training focus might be similar. Meaning it\u2019s a bit unstructured. This is why we are calling them the same thing. Type \u201cfr\u201d or \u201cfree-ride\u201d in the type box. So a free-ride section on Zwift means that it goes into resistance or slope mode so you must change your gears to set the appropriate power. The only way to use this feature is in the ZWO file download. TrainingPeaks does not support this for example.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0bKgaLAlGlVoznhFA.png)",

That would be a nice feature.\nUser Problem: Desire for terrain changes in free ride mode.\nAnswer: I agree 110%. I even tried to convince Zwift they should allow us direct integration because of this feature. I also tried to convince TrainingPeaks to support this. So this is the problem, we don\u2019t send ZWO file to TP as they don\u2019t support that and they don\u2019t support the concept of free-ride at all. To me this is so important but the only way to do it is with files. I was working on an automated file sync process with zwift too, which can be done from the browser (partially) but it did not work they way I hoped.\nSolution: Explained the limitations of current integration and the challenges faced.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I think option #3 would be a great option. Especially with the free ride. But do I understand it correctly that option #3 is currently not implemented/working? I tried it with my setup and workouts did not show up in Zwift.\nContext: User attempted to use the new sync feature.\nUser Problem: Option #3 not working as expected.\nAnswer: No we don\u2019t have #3 working. As I mentioned later it did not work as smoothly as I would like. I think we would need to develop a little app that you install on mac or pc to make this work but for people using appletv or other devices it would require them go to mac or pc and start it to make sure it syncs. A bit painful. Our calendar does sync to TrainingPeaks but still have no free-ride option. We are going to improve CJ to be more free-ride/slope mode focused for better z2 hr workouts and at that time (soon) maybe we can re-visit this and see if we have any good ideas.\nSolution: Explained the current limitations and future plans for improvement.",

Why?\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nOur titles are actually based on the long term focus/goal of the workout rather than the specific time in zone for any individual workout. This one specifically is recommend for outdoor when possible. Outdoor most people won\u2019t do a 3 hour zone 1 workout so it naturally turns into zone2/3\u2026 Just ideally starting easier and slowly getting a bit faster by the end of the block. Indoor is harder on your body for long duration efforts like this. Also this workout starts at lower intensity and slowly build it up so at the end of 12 weeks or so it should be mostly z2/z3 by the end. If you are using our training app and want to start with z2/z3 you can and just in the beginning press the up arrow at the bottom to get it to the right level. Finally many people are obsessed with proper TSS management and so slightly adjusting intensity in addition to duration of this type of effort is the best way for us to align with peoples expectations.",

There is mode based on HR, ERG and slope but what I find missing (or I maybe I don\u2019t know how to set it up) is workout based on distance. Use case: I have a specific climb I\u2019d like to ride. I can import rout in .grx format but it doesn\u2019t simulate distance. What I\u2019m looking for is something similar to Zwift free ride mode. E.g.: instead of riding 2 minutes on 5% slope, I\u2019d like to have possibility to ride 1km on 5% slope. Hope, I\u2019m clear enough. ps. great app. I\u2019m using it for almost 2 years\nContext: User is looking for a specific workout mode based on distance and slope.\nUser Problem: Missing workout mode based on distance.\nAnswer: Hi, it is not possible to do this. The problem is the way we display those charts, is they move 1 second at a time and bluetooth devices transmit that information 1 second at a time. So it would essentially take a complete re-write to make it so moving a specific distance at a time. I do think this is a cool feature it\u2019s just too complicated. Not to promote another app but biketerra is currently the winner in this space is my belief. I have talked to the guy there (Matt) a lot and he is a good guy. I should say obviously that there is not a meaningful difference between time and distance if you hit approximately the same watts. But if you changed your FTP or W\u2019a lot then it can matter a lot. I realize that distance is just nice since it matches the real world.\nSolution: Currently, it is not possible to implement a distance-based mode due to technical limitations.",

        "text": "Really I bet you could build any of the 20k workouts we have while riding by merging and skipping in real time, it just would require some focus and creative thinking. You can download the workouts but TP does not have an upload feature so you must upload to a Zwift folder on your PC (lots of info of this with google) and restart or start zwift. With the free version you also don\u2019t get sync to strava but you can download the finished activity and upload it yourself. There is no easy way to get custom workouts into TP other than via paid TrainerDay, so pushing to Garmin from TP is not a viable solution unless you buy a TP training plan for example. Paid TD is the cheapest and easiest way that I know of to get workouts on to Garmin. Does that help and make it clearer?\n\nPost 7 by pako1337:\nAs for paid version - have you ever considered lifetime option? This is by no means directed at you personally, just in general - I don\u2019t like that everything these days has to be subscription model. I would love to pay few more bucks for lifetime version and have lesser expectations of new features.\n\nPost 8 by Alex:\nI hate, hate, hate subscriptions!!! So I fully understand. I avoid them as much as possible. So as the customer I understand it 100%. There are hidden disadvantages for you as the customer that are not so obvious. A problem is, if you have a price such that makes sense to the customer than after 5 years or so most or many of your customers can have a lifetime license and you don\u2019t have much income so at that point the software starts to die or at least slows down, you have much more un predictable growth\u2026 So it feels like businesses gain the most from subscriptions but ultimately in most cases the customer does too because the business can be healthier via more consistent income. You can see in our case we have very low prices so it\u2019s not like we are making a killing. Again, I fully get it. I was trying to come up with a package for $500 including a re-sellable lifetime license and pro level bike fitting and some other stuff but ultimately gave up on it. I am guessing most people are not coming to us looking to spend $500 but obviously for us, then it makes a lot of sense.\n\nPost 9 by Serave84:\nI honestly don\u2019t mind the monthly membership. I can probably find other free apps, but Alex and everyone involve in trainerday provide amazing support. It is not a greedy price. I honestly wouldn\u2019t mind paying even if I wasn\u2019t using Coach Jack. I hope more people subscribe so we can all support trainerday and team. That way you can all keep making further improvements. Thanks, Alex and team making trainerday happen\n\nPost 10 by Alex:\nThanks so much. We are growing very fast so if this winter looks like the last years we will be on the road to being a very healthy company. It\u2019s so much fun to help cyclists such as yourself. I am living the dream.",

When I do this, on one time intervals.icu shows all of the interval markers from the workout, but for two other workout sessions it does not. Is there a problem with the exported .fit file?\nContext: User is trying to upload workouts to intervals.icu.\nUser Problem: Inconsistent detection of interval markers in uploaded workouts.\nAnswer: I believe interval markers is a feature of intervals.icu and not something included in the fit fit file (I am pretty sure we don\u2019t include anything) so it would seem intervals is better at finding those intervals but maybe an intervals expert here can help clarify. @MedTechCD Want to help\nSolution: Suggests that the issue may be related to how intervals.icu handles interval markers.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thanks both for your fast replies! I think I have it figured out now. The first TrainerDay session that I uploaded to intervals.icu, intervals.icu had correctly identified the intervals itself. However, the second ride had \u201cmicro intervals\u201d and then these were not properly detected. Then, the third ride had only small intensity variations, so no intervals were detected. Still, after opening the exported .fit files in Strava, I could see all the lap markers were in the exported file. So, I then deleted the sessions in intervals.icu, activated \u201cUse laps for intervals\u201d in the Settings, and reimported the session .fit files. After doing this, I see all the laps from the TrainerDay session. I have now re-verified, and having \u201cKeep all laps\u201d activated is not enough. What had added to my confusion on this is that, when I do a TP programmed session outside using my Garmin, when the Garmin .fit file auto-uploads to intervals.icu, I see all the Garmin laps when only \u201cKeep all laps\u201d is activated in the Settings. Somehow, the TrainerDay .fit files require that \u201cKeep laps for intervals\u201d is also activated. However, maybe that is as it should be\u2026\nContext: User explains their troubleshooting process and findings.\nUser Problem: Confusion over settings required for proper interval detection.\nAnswer: I disagree on that\u2026 Every other app controlling structured workouts, logs step markers (laps). I have never used the FIT or TCX from Trainerday because I always dual record on my head unit, so can\u2019t be absolutely sure. But if Trainerday isn\u2019t logging a step marker in the output file, that is wrong behaviour because it should. I suggest you check it out and add steps asap if they are not included.\nSolution: Suggests checking the output file for step markers.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: dalex: Somehow, the TrainerDay .fit files require that \u201cKeep laps for intervals\u201d is also activated. That is how it should be and is clearly explained in my guide post on the Intervals forum. The option is \u2018Use laps for intervals\u2019 an not \u2018Keep laps\u2026\u2019 If this option isn\u2019t ticked, you instruct Intervals to detect intervals with its internal algorithm (detection on power/HR/Pace) and ignore the lap markers in the FIT. If it is ticked, Intervals will not detect by its algorithm and simply follow the lap markers in the file. PS: @Alex The OP\u2019s comment would imply that the TrainerDay output file has lap markers, as it should be.\nContext: Clarification on settings and their implications.\nUser Problem: Misunderstanding of how settings affect interval detection.\nAnswer: Yes, I thought that was the case for our TCX files (lap markers) but was not so sure on the fit files but I agree sounds like the fit files have them as well. I also did not realize intervals had this lap to interval feature\u2026 learn something new every day\u2026 now let\u2019s see if I remember this Thanks for your help.\nSolution: Acknowledges the existence of lap markers in fit files and the feature in intervals.",

Example from today: ax1NcMi997\u00d71036 73.2 KB\nUser Problem: Uploaded activities show up without intervals.\nAnswer: Is Intervals set to show \u00b4Use laps\u00b4 or is it on auto-detect? Post screenshots because we can\u00b4t open links to your activities (privacy policies)\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thank you for your reply, I corrected the images above and to answer your question, I believe it is on automatic detection based on this setting? Note that it seems to be working for some activities and others not. The issue appears only with TrainerDay as my previous activities from MyWoosh or Zwift automatically appeared with intervals included (or detected): image2209\u00d71147 485 KB\nContext: User provided additional context about the issue.\nUser Problem: Some activities are detected with intervals while others are not.\nAnswer: Intervals is set to auto-detect like that. It works fine for intervals with higher intensity but low intensity, like a recovery ride, will just appear as one big block. Check the Use Laps checkbox and Intervals will use the intervals from the workout. At least, if they are written to the activity file. I\u2019m not 100% sure if they are because I never use the TrainerDay file. I always dual record with my bike computer and use that file. It pairs with a planned workout file in Intervals and takes the Intervals from there. From your screenshot, it looks like the workout targets are in the file. You can see the blue line in the background of the power stream. Try to Re-Analyze from the Actions menu and select \u2018Use Laps iso detecting intervals\u2019. That should give you all intervals.\nSolution: Check the Use Laps checkbox and try to Re-Analyze from the Actions menu.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Worked like a charm, thank you so much!\nAnswer:",

The calendar is the default plan.\n\n**#1\u200a\u2014\u200aMy Calendar WOD.** This provides a simple calendar for managing your workouts in our training app. Soon it will also synchronize the following week to Garmin, TrainingPeaks and after that Google Calendar. That means you can manage your plan in TrainerDay and have the rest update automatically. We call this WOD (workout of the day) because it works similar to the TrainingPeaks and IntervalsICU inside our training app that you see yesterday and 4 days forward in the app.\n\n**#2\u200a\u2014\u200aMy Plans.** If you don\u2019t want to follow a strict plan but prefer to just follow a sequence of workouts which gives you more flexibility without needing to strictly train on specific days or as issues arise, you can just show up tomorrow and your next workout is ready. With this option you see all your workouts in our training app on the plans tab.\n\n**#3 & #4\u200a\u2014\u200aTrainingPeaks and IntervalsICU.** These both will pull your calendar from either of these platforms. The both offer a more metrics focused approach to calendar management.\n\n### Sending a plan to your\u00a0calendar\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0NmeCYOnNMeo_5HXr.png)\n\nJust like our other calendar options you can send a plan to your calendar, or even specific weeks if you want to mix and match. You need to\n\n*   First\u200a\u2014\u200acreate a plan in my plans using our community plans or Coach Jack plans.\n*   Then go to my plans, click on the plan to get the details and send the plan to \u201cMy Calendar.\u201d\n\n### Editing \u201cMy Calendar\u201d\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0rMTlLXCyb78AkA_c.png)",

You can easily add a week, delete a week, add workouts from your library or add Coach Jack or other training plans.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-18SnBAi6C3v2DH1eRk92ocw.png)\n\nYou can sync this calendar to Garmin and Training Peaks, which is especially valuable if you use our Coach Jack plans. You can quickly edit your CJ plan in the plan builder and it will automatically re-sync to where you need it.
