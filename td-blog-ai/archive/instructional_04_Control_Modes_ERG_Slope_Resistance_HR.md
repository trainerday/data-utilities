### Control Modes in TrainerDay: How to Use Them

TrainerDay offers several control modes for your workouts, including ERG, Slope, Resistance, and Heart Rate (HR) modes. Each mode serves a different purpose and can be selected based on your training needs. Here's how to use each mode effectively within the TrainerDay app.

#### ERG Mode

1. **Selecting ERG Mode**: When creating or editing a workout, click on the interval where you want to apply ERG mode.
2. **Setting Power Targets**: Enter your desired power target for the interval. This can be a specific wattage or a percentage of your FTP (e.g., enter "120% FTP").
3. **Automatic Adjustments**: The app will automatically adjust the resistance of your smart trainer to help you maintain the specified power output throughout the interval.

#### Slope Mode

1. **Importing Slope Data**: To simulate a specific gradient, you can import slope data from a route into TrainerDay's workout creator.
2. **Setting Slope Percentage**: For manual slope settings, specify "slope" as the interval type and enter the desired fixed percentage grade (e.g., "5%" for a 5% incline).
3. **Riding the Slope**: Your smart trainer will simulate the specified gradient, and you can control your power output through gear selection and effort.

#### Resistance Mode

1. **Manual Mode Selection**: During a workout, you can manually switch to Resistance mode using the TrainerDay app controls.
2. **Adjusting Resistance**: Use the app's slider to set the resistance level. The specific increments depend on your trainer's capabilities.
3. **Controlling Output**: In this mode, you are in full control of your power output, which will vary based on your cadence and gear selection.

#### Heart Rate (HR) Mode

1. **Setting HR Targets**: When creating a HR-controlled workout, enter your target heart rate in the BPM column for each interval.
2. **Automatic Power Adjustments**: TrainerDay will adjust the power target of your smart trainer to keep you within the specified heart rate zone.
3. **Monitoring**: Ensure you're wearing a compatible heart rate monitor connected to TrainerDay to allow the app to adjust power targets accurately.

#### Automatic Mode Switching

TrainerDay features automatic mode switching within workouts, allowing you to experience different types of training stress without manual adjustments.

1. **Creating a Mixed-Mode Workout**: When designing your workout, specify the control mode for each interval (e.g., start with ERG mode, switch to Slope mode for hill simulations, then finish with HR mode).
2. **Starting Your Workout**: As you begin your session, TrainerDay will automatically switch the control mode based on the current interval's settings.
3. **Manual Overrides**: If needed, you can manually change modes during your workout using the app's on-screen controls.

#### Additional Tips

- **FTP Setting**: Ensure your FTP (Functional Threshold Power) is accurately set in TrainerDay for precise workout targeting, especially in ERG and HR modes.
- **Mode Limitations**: Some users have reported issues with specific trainers in certain modes. If you encounter problems, try switching modes or consult the TrainerDay forums for advice.
- **Manual Changes**: Remember, you can always manually switch modes during your workout if the automatic switch does not align with your training needs.

By understanding and utilizing the different control modes available in TrainerDay, you can tailor your indoor cycling workouts to better match your training goals, whether you're focusing on steady-state efforts, hill simulations, or heart rate-based training.
