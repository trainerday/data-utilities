# Workout Editor Basics

The TrainerDay workout editor offers two main methods for creating and modifying workouts:

## Grid-Based Editor
1. Access the editor by clicking "Create Workout" or selecting "Edit" on an existing workout
2. Enter values directly into the grid:
   - Minutes: Duration of each interval
   - FTP%: Power target as percentage of FTP
   - Type: Interval type (warm-up, cooldown, interval, etc.)
   - Comments: Optional interval descriptions

3. Navigate using arrow keys to move between cells
4. Use keyboard shortcuts:
   - Copy/paste to duplicate intervals
   - Add 10 rows: Click button at bottom of grid
   - Delete rows: Select and press delete

## Sets and Reps Editor
1. Click "Sets and Reps" toggle to switch modes
2. Enter:
   - Number of repetitions
   - Duration per interval
   - Target intensity
   - Rest duration between intervals

## Common Features
- Enter power targets as:
  - FTP percentage (default)
  - Absolute watts (requires FTP to be set)
  - Training zones

- Available interval types:
  - warm-up
  - cooldown
  - interval
  - rest
  - active
  - climb
  - free-ride
  - sfr (strength force resistance)

## Tips
- Empty rows are automatically removed when saving
- Use Excel for bulk modifications by copying/pasting between Excel and the editor
- For complex intervals, create the basic structure first, then add details
- Save frequently while making modifications

## Known Limitations
- No drag-and-drop functionality
- Sets and Reps editor may modify intervals when there's overlap
- Some interval types have limited compatibility with certain export formats

The editor prioritizes speed and efficiency over visual design, allowing rapid workout creation and modification using keyboard-based input.
