# Introduction to TrainerDay Workout Creation

Hey there, welcome to the intro on creating workouts with TrainerDay! Whether you're gearing up for some intense intervals or a chill recovery ride, we've got you covered. Let's dive into how you can tailor your training sessions to fit your goals, using our super straightforward workout editor and other cool features.

First off, TrainerDay offers two slick ways to craft your workouts: a grid-based system and a "Sets and Reps editor." Picture the grid system as a canvas, where you paint your workout masterpiece block by block. It's intuitive, letting you see the structure of your session at a glance. Now, for those of you who love crunching numbers and organizing your intervals neatly, the Sets and Reps editor will be your best friend. It simplifies the process, making it easier to create complex interval structures without cluttering your screen.

Getting your existing workouts into TrainerDay is a breeze with our import feature. Simply drag and drop your file or browse to select it. Whether it's for trying out a new training plan or revisiting a favorite session, importing workouts is as easy as pie.

For those of you who like to fine-tune your efforts based on heart rate, you'll appreciate being able to edit target BPM values directly in the workout editor. It's a fantastic way to ensure your training aligns with your cardiovascular goals.

Flexibility is key in training, and TrainerDay gets it. That's why you can extend intervals in 10-second or 30-second increments. If you're in the zone and want to push a bit harder, go for it! And for a bit of motivation or reminders, adding interval comments can give you that extra push or keep your focus sharp during the grind.

Now, let's talk about TrainerDay's route import feature. Dreaming of riding Alpe d'Huez but stuck indoors? Import the route, and you can train on that specific terrain from the comfort of your home. The app displays power targets and elevation profiles, making indoor training more dynamic and fun.

We believe in versatility, which is why TrainerDay allows you to specify which mode each interval should use. Fancy a bit of ERG mode for steady efforts, then switch to Slope mode for hill repeats? No problem. Our app seamlessly transitions between modes within the same workout, keeping things fresh and challenging. Plus, for those slope sessions, you can control your output through gear selection and effort, simulating real-world gradients.

Speaking of personalization, TrainerDay doesn't just stop at workout creation. Our app matches prescribed power targets to the specific resistance increments your trainer supports, ensuring precise training intensities. And for heart rate-based sessions, our app adjusts power targets to keep you in the right HR zone, making every beat count.

Organization is key to keeping your training on track, which is why TrainerDay offers tagging and lists for workout management. Whether you want to group workouts by type, intensity, or any other criteria, tags and lists make finding the right session hassle-free. And hey, if you're proud of your creation or found a gem in the community library, you can share workouts by making them public or keep them private for your eyes only.

We're all about making your training experience as smooth as possible. Features like the "hot swap" let you change workouts mid-session, keeping the momentum going even when plans change. And with our mobile app, you can broadcast your workout in real-time on a larger screen, making it easier to track your progress and stay engaged.

Lastly, TrainerDay is not just a solo journey. Our community library is a treasure trove of workouts shared by fellow cyclists and rowers. It's a great place to find inspiration and challenge yourself with new routines. Plus, with the ability to export workouts to other platforms and sync with devices and calendars, TrainerDay ensures your training fits seamlessly into your lifestyle.

So, whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, TrainerDay's workout creation tools are designed to make your training effective, engaging, and yes, a bit fun too. Dive in, experiment, and remember, if you want to make it harder, you surely can. Let's get those gains!
