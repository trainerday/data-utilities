# 6-Second Warmup

The 6-second warmup feature allows you to start pedaling immediately after launching the app, eliminating dead time between opening TrainerDay and beginning your workout.

## Using 6-Second Warmup

1. Open the TrainerDay app
2. Start pedaling immediately
3. Select your planned workout while pedaling

## Important Notes

- This feature is designed specifically for indoor training
- It can be combined with any planned workout
- This is not a replacement for a proper warmup before intense sessions
- The feature simply allows you to begin pedaling before selecting your workout

## Best Practices

- Use this feature to maximize training time efficiency
- For intense workouts, still complete a full warmup routine
- Start pedaling at an easy pace while navigating to your planned workout

Note: The 6-second warmup is essentially a "quick start" feature that lets you begin riding while setting up your session, rather than waiting to complete all setup steps before starting.
