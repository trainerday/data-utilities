        "text": "Blog Article: Designing The Perfect Interval Workout Using W'bal\n\n#### Starting with Progressive Overload\n\nAs most of you likely know, one of the key fundamentals of exercise is progressive overload. This means if you want to get stronger you need to go to failure or at least close to failure to tell your body it needs to repair itself and get stronger so next time this same exercise is easy.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0xYyOCvibyEmEczap.jpg)\n\n### How many intervals should I be\u00a0doing?\n\nEveryone knows that they have a limited amount of time, that they can sustain a hard-effort. We can clarify hard-effort as anything above your FTP. But how much time is that exactly? Meaning should I do four 2-minutes intervals @ 120% or maybe they should be 2:15 not 2-minutes. Since each athlete has a unique amount of anaerobic capacity (W\u2019). You should train with custom intervals matched to your personal W\u2019. You can hunt by trial and error, or you can use this cool TrainerDay feature called W\u2019 Balance (W\u2019Bal). This same feature has been in GoldenCheetah for a long time, but we feel we simplified it.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0ysY46bOrDhfas0UX.jpg)\n\n### Finding the perfect interval\u00a0workouts\n\nThis is a fairly deep subject but just starting with the basics is a huge step forward and something that many workout authors overlook. So for this article we are talking about intervals above your FTP. You want to tax your anaerobic system with just the right stimulus.\n\nThe basic idea is when you are above FTP your anaerobic work capacity (AWC or W\u2019) diminishes. Many people also call this \u201cburning matches.\u201d You only have so many matches to burn. Although when you drop below your FTP your W\u2019 recovers, or the match book fills back up, slowly. The great news is we have added W\u2019Bal to our workout creator.\n\n### 5000+ Is Too Many\u00a0Choices\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0WVmL4pI8fTbu_xpU.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0aQCWEwrcemsHW-_X.png)\n\nI would like to point out, I don\u2019t feel a 10-minute warm-up is enough, it should be closer to 20. It just improved the visibility in this example.\n\n### How to use the W\u2019Bal Calculator\n\nTurn on the W\u2019Bal feature. Enter your FTP or if you know it your CP in the CP box. Enter your W\u2019 ([how to calculate](https://trainerday.com/how-to-calculate-your-critical-power-cp-and-w/)) and you are good to go.\n\nThe red line shows you\u2019re predicted remaining energy and you can see at the end of this set of intervals your remaining energy is at the bottom this W\u2019Bal predicts you are completly fatigued at the end of the intervals. Perfect.\n\nMany scientific studies have proven the validity of these formulas.\n\nIn this example on the left, if you have a W\u2019 of 20kJ, and a FTP of 200, with those intervals, you will burn all your matches. The interesting thing is if you had a 300w FTP, you could not complete this workout (read [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|this article]] to find out why).

How to create your workout in TrainerDay.\n\nTranscript:\nI'm going to create a workout here and show you some of the more advanced modes of our workout Creator so I'll start with a 5- minute warm-up I'll do 40 to 65% of FTP and I'll do ERG mode so then we'll do 50 minutes of a heart rate workout and here we just enter a value so visually that we can see what we're doing but it actually doesn't do anything so and we type in HR and say I want to Target 140 BPM and then if cool down of 65 to 40% and we'll go back to ERG mode so there now you can see our app will automatically switch to ERG automatically switch to heart rate assuming that you have a heart rate monitor connected in our app and then switch back to ERG mode for the for the cool down now other interesting things you can do is if you wanted instead of ERG mode if you if you prefer to do a slope mode you could just do a slope of say 3% and so then you in slope mode again this value here 40 to 65% won't do anything it's just visual so that you kind of know what you're targeting or or or what your plan is but ultimately you control the intensity with your gearing and your pedaling just like a hill like a 3% Hill and then at the end it could switch back to ERG mode so you can switch in and out of any of these modes when it switches from slope mode to HR mode what it'll do is it'll start off at the same place and then it will slowly adjust to get your heart rate to the right place right so whether that's up or down so you can create HR intervals here if you wanted so you could do you know a 5 minute HR interval at 160 BPM and then you know do this put this cool down down lower I just did a copy paste and then do like a one minute rest and you could even do a one minute rest in ERG or HR mode we could just do e ERG at 40% and then another 5 minutes at this now it's going to just kind of these are going to kind of slowly go up and down right I mean ERG is going to jump down quickly when you switch to ERG but then in general it's going to slowly build up from that ERG back up to your full 160 so that's it",

        "text": "that that's the overview of the workout it will auto pause as I said if you have a power meter and you stop pedaling it will auto pause but you can also manual pause and manual start and you can stop a workout early so if you just hit stop button normally it would pop up with a popup do you want to save this workout because this is test mode it's not asking you if you want to do that so then when I when I stop the workout it actually goes back to what we called the warmup or a quick start so this is just a simple workout so we'll go ahead and select that workout again let's just say I or a different workout uh whatever yeah we'll take this workout so I'll go ahead and start again and show you some of the other features here which is for example we have this forward button so over right here you've got a forward button and when you click on it it skips to the end of your interval so if you want to shorten an interval at any point in time you can just you can just skip forward you know when you're when you're you're done with that interval the other thing you can do is you can extend an interval so over here on plus 10 seconds right now we've got 46 seconds remaining if I click on+ 10 now it's 42 I click on plus 10 now it's 51 I just added 10 seconds if you hold this button down for a while you get a popup and you can change that so if I want to ex automatically extend 1 minute now every time I I click on one minute or now every time I click on extend it it will extend it by 1 minute and so I can click on it 4:30 went to 5:30 so then I can go ahead and Skip I can skip again the other thing you can see is every time there's an interval change you can see the screen flash you can also turn up the volume on your phone and you can hear a little beep right before the interval changes either going up or going down right here you also see what is my next interval so my next interval is 2 minutes at 114 Watts so that's this little section right here if I'm adding new devices and if I don't have a smart trainer and maybe I have a Speed and Cadence Sensor for example you can you can go ahead and select your speed sensor and when you select your speed sensor it you get an option for virtual power so you can configure your power curve and so let's just say for one specific device if you're going 30 km per hour um you can translate that into Watts so each device has a a power curve and so let's just say 30 km per hour my on your device might be you know let's just say you know 150 watts or something so so we also support virtual power so now I'll go ahead and show you all the different setting options so you've got hour smoothing that will smooth that little line so the little white line that's going there uh let's go back to my training this this white line you can see the white line and the red line are right over the top of each other this is not normal this is just test mode but the white line is the power line and the red line is the is the heart rate line yours won't look like that your heart rate won't jump like that and follow the follow the power line perfectly but that white line when you some trainers have a very let's say bouncy white line or a very Jagged white line and so this power smoothing Smooths out that line we also have here power match if you have a a trainer and a separate power matter meter and the power meter is showing different values which it always does shows different values than your than your smart trainer let's say you can turn on power match and it will match the power in it will increase or decrease your target or your actual um what's sent to the trainer and so it will try to match the power of your of your trainer to your power meter and this doesn't work real good for short intervals but works good for more sustained efforts you also have a a dark theme and a light theme um we we do support different cycling different sports there's a a device called Swim ERG by Vasa that we support we also support uh rowing from concept 2 um but I won't go into those here you can change the device language we have different languages here and then in other options we have",

You can use our calendar and turn on auto-sync (paid) or push files manually each day for free.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0U-GeeI5Mc051h95E.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Transferring files manually on a\u00a0mac\n\nAlthough Wahoo does not officially support manually loading workouts on your Elemnt, this works fine.\n\n[https://trainerday.com/training-peaks-push-workouts/](https://trainerday.com/training-peaks-push-workouts/)\n\n#### Step 1\u200a\u2014\u200aOn a Mac you must install Android File Transfer\u00a0App\n\nThis is for a Mac. Download it and install it.  \n[https://www.android.com/filetransfer/](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/)\n\nMake sure it is open, but it will give a warning or error message. Just say OK. The next step will fix it.\n\n[Windows 10\u200a\u2014\u200aWatch Video Below](https://trainerday.com/load-workouts-onto-your-wahoo-elemnt-on-a-mac/#WindowsVideo)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0oZk9y0E0-TkFw0R7.png)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0z5zduovTZat0S7Jd.png)\n\n### 2\\. Connect USB in mode for File Transfer\u00a0App\n\nYou must hold the down button (on the right side) while inserting USB cable. After this step the window will open for the app showing your folders on your Elemnt. If not just go to the File transfer app, it should look like the screen on the next step on the left.\n\n### 3\\. Download and Transfer\u00a0Workout\n\nDownload workouts from ERGdb (we have 3000+ open source workouts) in MRC format and then just drag them into your plans folder.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0fW7KujescxncZnQy.png)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0Mu5FyWaSQyWQSW1U.png)\n\n### 4\\. Sync your Plans folder and view your\u00a0workout\n\nSee the image, here but generally, you just sync or restart your element and go to \u201cPlanned Workouts\u201d in your element and you will see your workout(s). You get to planned workouts by clicking left side button and you will see it there.\n\n\\* If you previously connected to Training Peaks you need to go to your phone and unlink Training Peaks for this to work.\n\n### 5\\. Deleting\u00a0Workouts\n\nBelow Murray from Wahoo says you can just delete the workouts from the Elemnt without a problem now. I have not tested this.\n\n**Previous information below\u2026**  \nSo there has been a lot of discussion around deleting workouts. It appears that Dale Rider found a solution. You must create an empty text file and name it the same file name as in your plans folder (endurance60.plan as an example). So example\\_name.plan would be a workout. Then just drag and drop that file into your plans folder and overwrite the existing file. I am using Mac\u2019s Text Edit app in this example. I personally have not tested this solution but others say it works.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0tECQA7V8RNnacr38.png)\n\n### A Note From Wahoo\u00a0Support\n\nThe ELEMNT is not currently designed to support external workouts being manually added to the device, there is not a good way to delete the workouts. Some have been able to delete by connecting the device to a computer and removing, but this is not foolproof. We do sincerely apologize. As we add this support to the device in the future, it should allow for expanded capabilities.\n\nThank you,\n\nWahoo Support (I left the persons name out)\n\n### Windows 10\u00a0Video\n\nThis is a video showing both adding a workout and deleting a workout from a Wahoo Elemnt using Windows 10 on a PC.",

But one easy thing to do is each day you want to train. Find your workout and click send to TrainingPeaks and in 30 seconds or less you can see it in they training platform of your choice.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0_Ea78aE9khMEDcp7.png)\n\nOther options for using TrainingPeaks are what is called WOD.

Virtually all coaches and experts would agree, plans should be adapted for you.\n\n**When cloning or copying a plan in TrainerDay, you can select the days you want to train.**\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0oDRIyoBkBDOli6yj.jpg)\n\n**It won\u2019t take long, take control, make some adjustments.** You should adapt these generic training plans to you. Make some simple adjustments.\n\nGreat coach and author Joe Friel illustrates the need to adapt plans in his book Fast After 50. Joe suggests that an aging athlete might want to adapt a plan designed for 7-days a week, to a 9-day a week pattern to provide more recovery time.\n\n**Do you have a life and a job other than cycling?** In most cases, 3 or 4 hard days a week allows for adequate recovery for most non-pros. If recovery rides provide recovery for you, then you can add some Z1 rides on your days off. Many plans on our site have a lot of hard days. You can cone one of those plans, selecting 3 or 4 days a week, and then add in some recovery rides manually. Should only take a few minutes.\n\nRecovery rides should be Zone 1. Such as this.

The interesting thing is if you had a 300w FTP, you could not complete this workout (read [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|this article]] to find out why). Another benefit is that designing workouts that you know you should be able to finish can help inspire you to push a little farther. If you make this last interval a little farther and you can finish it (i.e. you can go below zero) that frequently means your W\u2019 or possibly FTP is likely a little higher than you thought.\n\n[View My Example W\u2019bal Workout](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/45588/copy)\n\n### Watch a 6-minute video below showing you how W\u2019Bal works in TrainerDay\n\n[https://youtu.be/rrIc7LZ8Cjk](https://youtu.be/rrIc7LZ8Cjk)\n\n### Additional Reading\n\nHere is a good article describing the value of W\u2019 and W\u2019Bal\n\n[https://pezcyclingnews.com/toolbox/the-anaerobic-w/](https://pezcyclingnews.com/toolbox/the-anaerobic-w/)\n\nThe below link is deep but if you really want to understand, Mark from GoldenCheetah knows the ins and outs\n\n[http://markliversedge.blogspot.com/2014/07/wbal-its-implementation-and-optimisation.html](http://markliversedge.blogspot.com/2014/07/wbal-its-implementation-and-optimisation.html)\n\nThis video from Mark is a good balance between deep and useful\n\n[https://vimeo.com/100599100](https://vimeo.com/100599100)\n\nMark has done lots of writing and videos about W\u2019 and W\u2019Bal that are worth learning more about.

        "text": "Blog Article: Designing The Perfect Interval Workout Using W'bal\n\n#### Starting with Progressive Overload\n\nAs most of you likely know, one of the key fundamentals of exercise is progressive overload. This means if you want to get stronger you need to go to failure or at least close to failure to tell your body it needs to repair itself and get stronger so next time this same exercise is easy.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0xYyOCvibyEmEczap.jpg)\n\n### How many intervals should I be\u00a0doing?\n\nEveryone knows that they have a limited amount of time, that they can sustain a hard-effort. We can clarify hard-effort as anything above your FTP. But how much time is that exactly? Meaning should I do four 2-minutes intervals @ 120% or maybe they should be 2:15 not 2-minutes. Since each athlete has a unique amount of anaerobic capacity (W\u2019). You should train with custom intervals matched to your personal W\u2019. You can hunt by trial and error, or you can use this cool TrainerDay feature called W\u2019 Balance (W\u2019Bal). This same feature has been in GoldenCheetah for a long time, but we feel we simplified it.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0ysY46bOrDhfas0UX.jpg)\n\n### Finding the perfect interval\u00a0workouts\n\nThis is a fairly deep subject but just starting with the basics is a huge step forward and something that many workout authors overlook. So for this article we are talking about intervals above your FTP. You want to tax your anaerobic system with just the right stimulus.\n\nThe basic idea is when you are above FTP your anaerobic work capacity (AWC or W\u2019) diminishes. Many people also call this \u201cburning matches.\u201d You only have so many matches to burn. Although when you drop below your FTP your W\u2019 recovers, or the match book fills back up, slowly. The great news is we have added W\u2019Bal to our workout creator.\n\n### 5000+ Is Too Many\u00a0Choices\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0WVmL4pI8fTbu_xpU.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0aQCWEwrcemsHW-_X.png)\n\nI would like to point out, I don\u2019t feel a 10-minute warm-up is enough, it should be closer to 20. It just improved the visibility in this example.\n\n### How to use the W\u2019Bal Calculator\n\nTurn on the W\u2019Bal feature. Enter your FTP or if you know it your CP in the CP box. Enter your W\u2019 ([how to calculate](https://trainerday.com/how-to-calculate-your-critical-power-cp-and-w/)) and you are good to go.\n\nThe red line shows you\u2019re predicted remaining energy and you can see at the end of this set of intervals your remaining energy is at the bottom this W\u2019Bal predicts you are completly fatigued at the end of the intervals. Perfect.\n\nMany scientific studies have proven the validity of these formulas.\n\nIn this example on the left, if you have a W\u2019 of 20kJ, and a FTP of 200, with those intervals, you will burn all your matches. The interesting thing is if you had a 300w FTP, you could not complete this workout (read [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|this article]] to find out why). Another benefit is that designing workouts that you know you should be able to finish can help inspire you to push a little farther. If you make this last interval a little farther and you can finish it (i.e. you can go below zero) that frequently means your W\u2019 or possibly FTP is likely a little higher than you thought.",

You can only do smart slopes in our training app. Smart slope workouts are especially perfect for short-intervals. On many smart-trainers ERG mode is not good for short- intervals. I think all trainers are bad for 5-second intervals in ERG mode. Science has shown that very short intervals can be a great minimalistic method of training.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0hGttUAsyWEYot4iW.png)\n\nSprinting in slope mode by shifting gears and increasing cadence makes it more like an outdoor sprint. Smart Slopes or automated slope mode allows the trainer to change slopes automatically, similar to Zwift except that you are programming the slopes. Slope workouts are very individual.\n\n**Slope mode workouts require practice.** Practice in creating the perfect workout and practice executing the workout. We will start creating a list of recommended slope workouts, but you will still need to perfect your gears and cadence to hit the targets. When you are creating workouts, you are setting the slope, but you are also setting the target power/percent. This target power is a visual representation of what you are trying to hit, but since you control the power output by changing gears and cadence, it\u2019s only a reference point.\n\n**Mixed slope and ERG mode.** If you have ever taken a 20-minute FTP test or 8-minute FTP test on most platforms, they go in and out of ERG and slope or resistance mode. You can design your own workouts to do exactly the same in TrainerDay. Any interval you can change to slope or erg just by clicking the switch in our app.\n\nSee our editor before on how to create slope workouts. You don\u2019t need to set slope in the interval type unless you want it to automatically change for you.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0pEOaLR0G1vagKEA9.png)\n\nTo use smart slopes you must have a premium account.\n\nIf you have a premium account now, you can start creating your first workout in our [workout creator.](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/create)\n\n[Upgrade Now](https://trainerday.com/pricing/)\n\n### A great example slope\u00a0workout\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0cymNak6fNn-586IU.png)\n\nHere is a [link to that workout](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/4-second-intervals)\n\n[https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/4-second-intervals](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/4-second-intervals)\n\nThis workout first increases slope right before the 4-second intervals. Then you should shift and increase cadence and go as hard as you can for 4-seconds.\n\nHere is a study showing this can be great for general fitness, but 4-second workouts can be fun when you need something else to do as well as bringing great sprinting benefits. **You must have a trainer that is capable of more watts than your 4-second limit.**\n\n[https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/fitness/four-second-interval-workouts-may-be-all-it-takes-to-maintain-fitness-and-strength-1.4654140](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/fitness/four-second-interval-workouts-may-be-all-it-takes-to-maintain-fitness-and-strength-1.4654140)",

Once you do this you come to TrainerDay connections page under settings and you can connect to TrainingPeaks.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0bb6opA-UpeVi9Gta.png)\n\nOnce this is done the rest is easy. Just find any workout or plan and send it to TrainingPeaks. With plans you should have a Premium TrainingPeaks account or the whole plan will go on a single day. But one easy thing to do is each day you want to train. Find your workout and click send to TrainingPeaks and in 30 seconds or less you can see it in they training platform of your choice.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0_Ea78aE9khMEDcp7.png)\n\nOther options for using TrainingPeaks are what is called WOD. When this is enabled, if you are using your TrainingPeaks calendar and have a workout scheduled in the next few days you will see it inside our Training app.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0pFm7f7La-pRtnJfM.png)\n\nYou might need to pull down on the library tab in our app to refresh, but when you do, your workouts will show up on the Library/Plan tab.\n\nI hope that helps.

W\u2019 won\u2019t tell you anything. Even though over-unders like these below have an anaerobic component, they are primarily aerobic. W\u2019 can not predict the difficulty in these. It\u2019s probably obvious, but we call them over-unders because they are a little over FTP and a little under. You can play with the percentages above and below as you like.\n\n**Over-Unders\u200a\u2014**\u200aMost top coaches recommend starting on the easier side of hard workouts and working your way up. Micro-damage creates gains much faster than too-hard of efforts. Too hard of efforts frequently requires too much recovery, which slows your progress.

Download it and install it.  \n[https://www.android.com/filetransfer/](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/)\n\nMake sure it is open, but it will give a warning or error message. Just say OK.

Connect USB in mode for File Transfer\u00a0App\n\nYou must hold the down button (on the right side) while inserting USB cable. After this step the window will open for the app showing your folders on your Elemnt. If not just go to the File transfer app, it should look like the screen on the next step on the left.\n\n### 3\\.

Sync your Plans folder and view your\u00a0workout\n\nSee the image, here but generally, you just sync or restart your element and go to \u201cPlanned Workouts\u201d in your element and you will see your workout(s). You get to planned workouts by clicking left side button and you will see it there.\n\n\\* If you previously connected to Training Peaks you need to go to your phone and unlink Training Peaks for this to work.\n\n### 5\\. Deleting\u00a0Workouts\n\nBelow Murray from Wahoo says you can just delete the workouts from the Elemnt without a problem now. I have not tested this.\n\n**Previous information below\u2026**  \nSo there has been a lot of discussion around deleting workouts. It appears that Dale Rider found a solution. You must create an empty text file and name it the same file name as in your plans folder (endurance60.plan as an example). So example\\_name.plan would be a workout. Then just drag and drop that file into your plans folder and overwrite the existing file. I am using Mac\u2019s Text Edit app in this example. I personally have not tested this solution but others say it works.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0tECQA7V8RNnacr38.png)\n\n### A Note From Wahoo\u00a0Support\n\nThe ELEMNT is not currently designed to support external workouts being manually added to the device, there is not a good way to delete the workouts. Some have been able to delete by connecting the device to a computer and removing, but this is not foolproof. We do sincerely apologize. As we add this support to the device in the future, it should allow for expanded capabilities.\n\nThank you,\n\nWahoo Support (I left the persons name out)\n\n### Windows 10\u00a0Video\n\nThis is a video showing both adding a workout and deleting a workout from a Wahoo Elemnt using Windows 10 on a PC.",

Click on quick start in the TrainerDay training app\n2.  Make sure your heart rate monitor and smart trainer are connected\n3.  Click on HR mode\n4.  Start pedalling\n5.  Click +\u200a\u2014\u200ain our app to set your target\n\nSo that is the easiest part. Just like determining your FTP. For Zone 2 training you should do a test to determine your target heart rate. If you prefer to keep it simple to start with you can can just train at 65% of your maximum heart rate and you can start training. You don\u2019t need to do anything else. But keep reading if you want to set everything up \u201cperfectly.\u201d\n\n**Percent of maximum heart rate vs percent of threshold heart rate.** Above I suggested 65% of maximum heart rate. If you don\u2019t know your maximum heart rate I provided a test you can do below.\n\nBut our app is designed so that heart rate works similar to power based training so we suggest you start by setting your threshold heart rate in our app.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1nlCxbl9XpKz-wSEQUlwG8g.png)\n\nThreshold heart rate is the same heart rate that you have when going as hard as you can for about 40 minutes. Because accuracy **does NOT affect your training** it does not need to be perfectly accurate but will improve your experience a little by setting the right scaling in our app. Also at the bottom we show your target % of threshold rather than your target of maximum heart rate. If you have your threshold heart rate set accurately. You can just set your target to 80% and that should be a reasonable Zone 2 target as well.\n\n**The best way to determine your target Zone 2 heart rate**\n\n![Zone 2 Heart Rate test using ERG mode on a smart trainer](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1lwv9_NqmII0sExACjPhegA.png)\n\nHere is a link to that workout. You can just add it to your library.\n\n[https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/zone-2-heart-rate-test](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/zone-2-heart-rate-test)\n\nOnce you have this Zone 2 value from this test, subtract 5 bpm (so Target = 140\u20135 for example).\n\n**Maximum heart rate test.**\u00a0See below, the 2nd and 3rd intervals automatically switch to slope mode and you should just go as hard as you can for 60 seconds in the first one and 30 seconds to 2 minutes in the second one. You must adjust your gearing and pedal as hard as you can.\n\n[https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/maximum-heart-rate-test](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/maximum-heart-rate-test)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1TFrgQ6US9V-x3oQt0HgHgA.png)\n\nA video describing this process and going into more depth.\n\n[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYBr2IhILUE)",

        "text": "This is all based on established science. W\u2019 is a fixed amount of energy that you have above your FTP. You can do a fixed # of watts for a fixed amount of time. Also, to clarify 1 joule is 1 watt for 1 second and a kJ is 1000 joules.\n\nFor Rider-A 180% of FTP is 360 watts (FTP+160 watts)  \nFor Rider-B 180% of FTP is 540 watts (FTP+240 watts)\n\nSo a 2-minute interval will bring Rider-A to a perfect failure point at 2-minutes (120-seconds) 120\\*160w = 19.2kJ of energy out of his 20kJ. (See chart on the right\u200a\u2014\u200atop)\n\nFor Rider-B, 120\\*240w = 28kJ of energy. 28kJ is much bigger than his 20kJ available, he can\u2019t even get close to completing the two minutes. (See chart on the right\u200a\u2014\u200abottom)\n\nWe could say these two different riders have two different fitness profiles and need different anaerobic workouts to optimize their training.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0hJIesD4VbkZyJfpL.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0AeHkZVAYuIcNXo46.jpg)\n\n### The Solution\n\nThe above was a simple example. When you are talking about multiple intervals with rests between them it\u2019s more complex. This is where W\u2019Bal saves the day. It does all this magically for you and tells you exactly how to create the perfect anaerobic workouts designed for you. It\u2019s very simple in TrainerDay. Once you know your FTP and W\u2019, finding and designing workouts is easy. Continue on to the quick read of our 3-part series on what these terms mean in simplified detail and how it all works.\n\n[Get a Deeper Understanding](https://trainerday.com/measure_your_anaerobic/)\n\nAnd learn how to use our new W\u2019Bal Feature",

I could just copy and paste each of these in here like this and then when I change this first 130 to 140 it changes all of them to 140 and you can see my average watch just went to to 260 or if I go 115 I can see my average Watts just went to 225 and then I can just copy and paste this these three rows it ignores kind of that middle row so I just copy and paste these three rows they're all 115s in here I've got my new workout and I can save it and I know my average thanks",

How to create your workout in TrainerDay.\n\nTranscript:\nI'm going to create a workout here and show you some of the more advanced modes of our workout Creator so I'll start with a 5- minute warm-up I'll do 40 to 65% of FTP and I'll do ERG mode so then we'll do 50 minutes of a heart rate workout and here we just enter a value so visually that we can see what we're doing but it actually doesn't do anything so and we type in HR and say I want to Target 140 BPM and then if cool down of 65 to 40% and we'll go back to ERG mode so there now you can see our app will automatically switch to ERG automatically switch to heart rate assuming that you have a heart rate monitor connected in our app and then switch back to ERG mode for the for the cool down now other interesting things you can do is if you wanted instead of ERG mode if you if you prefer to do a slope mode you could just do a slope of say 3% and so then you in slope mode again this value here 40 to 65% won't do anything it's just visual so that you kind of know what you're targeting or or or what your plan is but ultimately you control the intensity with your gearing and your pedaling just like a hill like a 3% Hill and then at the end it could switch back to ERG mode so you can switch in and out of any of these modes when it switches from slope mode to HR mode what it'll do is it'll start off at the same place and then it will slowly adjust to get your heart rate to the right place right so whether that's up or down so you can create HR intervals here if you wanted so you could do you know a 5 minute HR interval at 160 BPM and then you know do this put this cool down down lower I just did a copy paste and then do like a one minute rest and you could even do a one minute rest in ERG or HR mode we could just do e ERG at 40% and then another 5 minutes at this now it's going to just kind of these are going to kind of slowly go up and down right I mean ERG is going to jump down quickly when you switch to ERG but then in general it's going to slowly build up from that ERG back up to your full 160 so that's it",

Virtually all coaches and experts would agree, plans should be adapted for you.\n\n**When cloning or copying a plan in TrainerDay, you can select the days you want to train.**\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0oDRIyoBkBDOli6yj.jpg)\n\n**It won\u2019t take long, take control, make some adjustments.** You should adapt these generic training plans to you. Make some simple adjustments.\n\nGreat coach and author Joe Friel illustrates the need to adapt plans in his book Fast After 50. Joe suggests that an aging athlete might want to adapt a plan designed for 7-days a week, to a 9-day a week pattern to provide more recovery time.\n\n**Do you have a life and a job other than cycling?** In most cases, 3 or 4 hard days a week allows for adequate recovery for most non-pros. If recovery rides provide recovery for you, then you can add some Z1 rides on your days off. Many plans on our site have a lot of hard days. You can cone one of those plans, selecting 3 or 4 days a week, and then add in some recovery rides manually. Should only take a few minutes.\n\nRecovery rides should be Zone 1. Such as this.

You can try something like this, but for many people this would not provide 100% recovery.

During this clone/copy process, you can set the days you want to train on. You can change the actual days, or you can change the number of days per seek or both.\n\nConversion below.

That means you can manage your plan in TrainerDay and have the rest update automatically. We call this WOD (workout of the day) because it works similar to the TrainingPeaks and IntervalsICU inside our training app that you see yesterday and 4 days forward in the app.\n\n**#2\u200a\u2014\u200aMy Plans.** If you don\u2019t want to follow a strict plan but prefer to just follow a sequence of workouts which gives you more flexibility without needing to strictly train on specific days or as issues arise, you can just show up tomorrow and your next workout is ready. With this option you see all your workouts in our training app on the plans tab.\n\n**#3 & #4\u200a\u2014\u200aTrainingPeaks and IntervalsICU.** These both will pull your calendar from either of these platforms. The both offer a more metrics focused approach to calendar management.\n\n### Sending a plan to your\u00a0calendar\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0NmeCYOnNMeo_5HXr.png)\n\nJust like our other calendar options you can send a plan to your calendar, or even specific weeks if you want to mix and match. You need to\n\n*   First\u200a\u2014\u200acreate a plan in my plans using our community plans or Coach Jack plans.\n*   Then go to my plans, click on the plan to get the details and send the plan to \u201cMy Calendar.\u201d\n\n### Editing \u201cMy Calendar\u201d\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0rMTlLXCyb78AkA_c.png)",

Next on the roadmap is adding them to our iOS and Android training apps.\n\nIf you want to delete a row, just clear the comment out and it will automatically be removed when you save it.\n\nIf you have any questions, just let us know. I will create a video showing it soon.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0LZpCJ_cjjW8LEeUl.jpg)",

Ok I will check.\n\nPost 3 by Alex:\nSo I believe what you are seeing is all functionality on Intervals side and has really nothing to do with TrainerDay (or I am confused) but you are showing a planned workout from TrainerDay and a completed activity in Intervals. If you used our app to record the workout you should show me the completed activity in TrainerDay vs the completed activity in IntervalsICU, meaning apples to apples to try to understand better. What you are seeing at the bottom of the page in intervals is the auto interval detection feature if I am not mistaken. Also if you are sending planned workouts from TD to intervals you could show me planned on both sides and see if they are different it\u2019s just too much in the middle of comparing planned to completed.",

He is also selling his coaching; we understand this. I believe most and possibly all of his points are true regardless of his motive. I will say not every fact is clear for example Dylan states putting the high intensity at the beginning of a workout. I am 100% sure what he means is putting high-intensity shortly after a proper warm-up.\n\n**Warmup, warmup, warmup  \n**A warmup is so important, it will significantly reduce the chances of musculoskeletal damage. Your warmup should build to prepare you for the effort to come.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0NrJ2zksi6xF1B3Wi.png)\n\n**A proper warm-up typically means 20-minutes.** The industry seems to have a trend of reducing the warm-up and cool down times. I have heard many time-crunched cyclists justify this. I can assure you it makes about as much sense as going to a fast-food restaurant so you can spend more time on your bike.\n\nDylan Johnson\u200a\u2014\u200aCTS\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Problem with Zwift Workouts and Training Plans\n\n[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmVZshpLaqs)",

Dylan has a lot of videos. Take notes on them (we will continue to do this). If you take his suggestions and build a cheat-sheet, you will start having solid principals to being your own coach.\n\n**Europe vs America**\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0xgaoVk6vxqund0VU.jpg)\n\nI am friends with one of the top European coaches. What I see is his big picture principals are similar to Dylan\u2019s. Looking at the respected cycling author Joe Friel, Joe also seems to follow similar big picture fundamentals. I would say Joe provides a lot of detail that makes it feel a complex. I trust Joe, buy our goal is to simplify. We feel in most cases complex plans and workouts come from marketing based programs and both complexity and the \u201clatest and greatest\u201d helps sell books and plans.\n\nAmerica has this no-pain, no-gain philosophy related to training. Europe is a little more pragmatic in general. Europe also seems to moving closer it\u2019s thinking towards buying into this American and now global marketing. If you look more closely at the top coaches in both the US and Europe, they continue to promote both the value of easy and recovery. Easy does not product pain, but it does produce results when used correctly.\n\n**My belief is** when you see the effectiveness of simple plans and workouts following evidence-based programs, you will decide you don\u2019t need these marketing based complexities. Our goal is to provide you this information in the minimum number of words possible. We will do this by providing targeted information based on your goals and life. This article is step one towards our learning solution. It helps establish a baseline. Our/your primary learning tools will come in 2020/2021.

If you get the big picture right, your self-coaching will take you a long way down the right path.\n\n**What is the big picture?** I would focus on having a solid annual training plan (ATP) or in other words, a well-executed periodization model. Don\u2019t do the same thing all year long!!! For example, you need recovery time built into your year. Nail periodization and the rest will probably fall into place.\n\n**MORE COMMING SOON.** This is just the tip of the iceberg, but I feel it is an important part that many cyclists are not spending enough time on.",

W\u2019 won\u2019t tell you anything. Even though over-unders like these below have an anaerobic component, they are primarily aerobic. W\u2019 can not predict the difficulty in these. It\u2019s probably obvious, but we call them over-unders because they are a little over FTP and a little under. You can play with the percentages above and below as you like.\n\n**Over-Unders\u200a\u2014**\u200aMost top coaches recommend starting on the easier side of hard workouts and working your way up. Micro-damage creates gains much faster than too-hard of efforts. Too hard of efforts frequently requires too much recovery, which slows your progress. Really, about a total of 20\u201330 minutes of work is about as long as top coaches recommend or that sane people complete (including the pros). These workouts below are a total of 9-minutes.

        "text": "Blog Article: Designing The Perfect Interval Workout Using W'bal\n\n#### Starting with Progressive Overload\n\nAs most of you likely know, one of the key fundamentals of exercise is progressive overload. This means if you want to get stronger you need to go to failure or at least close to failure to tell your body it needs to repair itself and get stronger so next time this same exercise is easy.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0xYyOCvibyEmEczap.jpg)\n\n### How many intervals should I be\u00a0doing?\n\nEveryone knows that they have a limited amount of time, that they can sustain a hard-effort. We can clarify hard-effort as anything above your FTP. But how much time is that exactly? Meaning should I do four 2-minutes intervals @ 120% or maybe they should be 2:15 not 2-minutes. Since each athlete has a unique amount of anaerobic capacity (W\u2019). You should train with custom intervals matched to your personal W\u2019. You can hunt by trial and error, or you can use this cool TrainerDay feature called W\u2019 Balance (W\u2019Bal). This same feature has been in GoldenCheetah for a long time, but we feel we simplified it.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0ysY46bOrDhfas0UX.jpg)\n\n### Finding the perfect interval\u00a0workouts\n\nThis is a fairly deep subject but just starting with the basics is a huge step forward and something that many workout authors overlook. So for this article we are talking about intervals above your FTP. You want to tax your anaerobic system with just the right stimulus.\n\nThe basic idea is when you are above FTP your anaerobic work capacity (AWC or W\u2019) diminishes. Many people also call this \u201cburning matches.\u201d You only have so many matches to burn. Although when you drop below your FTP your W\u2019 recovers, or the match book fills back up, slowly. The great news is we have added W\u2019Bal to our workout creator.\n\n### 5000+ Is Too Many\u00a0Choices\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0WVmL4pI8fTbu_xpU.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0aQCWEwrcemsHW-_X.png)\n\nI would like to point out, I don\u2019t feel a 10-minute warm-up is enough, it should be closer to 20. It just improved the visibility in this example.\n\n### How to use the W\u2019Bal Calculator\n\nTurn on the W\u2019Bal feature. Enter your FTP or if you know it your CP in the CP box. Enter your W\u2019 ([how to calculate](https://trainerday.com/how-to-calculate-your-critical-power-cp-and-w/)) and you are good to go.\n\nThe red line shows you\u2019re predicted remaining energy and you can see at the end of this set of intervals your remaining energy is at the bottom this W\u2019Bal predicts you are completly fatigued at the end of the intervals. Perfect.\n\nMany scientific studies have proven the validity of these formulas.\n\nIn this example on the left, if you have a W\u2019 of 20kJ, and a FTP of 200, with those intervals, you will burn all your matches. The interesting thing is if you had a 300w FTP, you could not complete this workout (read [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|this article]] to find out why). Another benefit is that designing workouts that you know you should be able to finish can help inspire you to push a little farther. If you make this last interval a little farther and you can finish it (i.e. you can go below zero) that frequently means your W\u2019 or possibly FTP is likely a little higher than you thought.",

        "text": "Blog Article: Designing The Perfect Training Plan Part 1\n\nThe Perfect Training Plan\u200a\u2014\u200aOpen source training plans. We refer to the individual periods of a plan as a block. Each block has a goal. So how do you pick or design the perfect next block? You don\u2019t \ud83d\ude42 It\u2019s always a compromise. Identifying a blocks primary goal will help you create or find the right block. The fundamentals behind base and build blocks fit into most riders seasons or annual training plans. Almost all pro-cyclist have both a base and build periods every season. Most enthusiast/traveller cyclists will benefit from them as well.\n\nI talk with many top cycling coaches including Tour de France coaches. There seems to be a common agreement, there are a lot of terrible plans and workouts floating around these days that make little sense for any cyclist. I am not saying that open source training plans or TrainerDay will solve this problem or improve this soon. Just stating **that\u2019s our goal.**\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-05eKzq0mSWlE8GFae.jpg)\n\n**A Passion for helping others  \n**I believe we need training plans created by people and coaches passionate about helping others stay safe, healthy and improve their cycling abilities. This might not be the most visually appealing plans and workouts or the most profitable but simple, targeted workouts are a great place to start\u00a0. Here is a classic sweet spot workout with a single focus.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-00MjCZDHaHGG_2YTe.png)\n\n**Consistency is the most important step in personal performance.** A plan that keeps you consistent is a good plan. Being under-trained (within reason) is significantly better than becoming physically over-stressed. Error on the side of safety. Too much training stress will reduce your progress and it makes you vulnerable to illness and injury. It\u2019s Stress + **Recovery**. Beginners frequently underestimate the important of recovery.\n\n**So how about exciting training blocks?  \n**The best training blocks may not be the most exciting. The primary goal of most cyclists should be consistency. Variety can help with that goal. Picking the right plan or block frequently requires a coach. Many or most cyclists can\u2019t or are unwilling to pay for coaches\u2019 expertise. Most of us need to educate ourselves the best we can. Good self-coaching can get you far but until you are an expert you should be more conservative. Plans need continued evaluation and adjustments.\n\n**Learn from the experts  \n**CTS is one of the top coaching organizations in the world. Study this video below and listen to Dylan\u2019s complaints about many of the Zwift plans and workouts. Take notes. He gives a lot of clues as to how to design good plans and workouts. **As Dylan points out Zwift is great**, it\u2019s just that some or many plans and workouts are of poor design. This video can take you a long way into designing or choosing a good winter plan. I really believe many of the ideas presented in this video represents the view of many of the top coaches. To repeat **Zwift is great for group rides and racing,** it can also create winter consistency for many cyclists. In addition, there are some quality workouts and plans in Zwift but you need to do a careful evaluation to pick something that makes sense for your goals.\n\nDylan might sound negative about Zwift workouts and plans. I believe he is primarily stating how many of these plans and workouts don\u2019t follow well established best practices. He is also selling his coaching; we understand this. I believe most and possibly all of his points are true regardless of his motive. I will say not every fact is clear for example Dylan states putting the high intensity at the beginning of a workout. I am 100% sure what he means is putting high-intensity shortly after a proper warm-up.\n\n**Warmup, warmup, warmup  \n**A warmup is so important, it will significantly reduce the chances of musculoskeletal damage. Your warmup should build to prepare you for the effort to come.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0NrJ2zksi6xF1B3Wi.png)\n\n**A proper warm-up typically means 20-minutes.",

        "text": "Blog Article: Everything You Need to Know About Training in 15 Minutes: Dylan Johnson (CTS)\n\nWe are starting a series on evidence-based training. The primary goal is to inspire you to take full control of your training and be more confident in your choices and recognize when you are going off the path. Following a generic training plan will rarely make you as fast as if you self-coach and make quality adjustments along the way. These adjustments are critical to top health, which plays a big part in your performance.\n\nVideo Review: CTS is arguably one of the most respected coaching organizations in the world. In this video, Dylan represents the CTS and backs up his claims with evidence. He uses references from the extremely well-respected sports scientist Stephen Seiler from Norway. I am not so sure it is everything you need to know in 15-minutes, especially I think he could limit the discussion on weight training. His other videos fill in many of the gaps he left out of this.\n\nOne interesting thing is, just like virtually all pro-level coaches, Dylan\u2019s suggestions are simple. Basic periodization, a few simple workouts that progressively get harder and a shift to more weight training in the off season. What we call a peak period, he calls a build period, that targets your specific goals.\n\n[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nqHn3vAWpI)\n\n**Some of Dylan\u2019s claims below**\n\nMany of them backed up with evidence\n\nBelow, we have captured some good points Dylan makes in this video. Take these and start to build your own library of knowledge on how to self-coach and take your performance to the next level. It takes a little time, but your performance will benefit. Invest in your future!!!\n\n1.  Periodization means that your training is changing over time, which is what we want\n2.  When planning out a season it\u2019s important that your workouts become more specific to your goal event as you get closer to that event\n3.  Short-term periods of high-intensity interval training can elicit improvements but also that important adaptations appear to occur with low intensity continuous training that are not observed with mixed or high-intensity training when training does not have an appropriate blend of both high-intensity training and high-volume training inserted into the program performance ability can stagnate\n4.  The timeline for all of this higher intensity could be four to seven months before you want to be in peak shape\n5.  With few exceptions having just two or on occasion three high-intensity days per week is what you\u2019re shooting for and you want to do these days when you\u2019re well-rested so they can be as high quality as possible\n6.  Don\u2019t forget to throw in a rest week every three to four weeks to rid your\n7.  Body of the fatigue you\u2019ve built up during a rest week you\u2019re still riding but at about forty to sixty percent of your normal volume\n8.  The optimal tapering strategy was one that reduced volume without any modifications in intensity or frequency\n9.  One of the most important things you can do to improve your cycling performance is to not train at selective points in the year hear me out taking a break is extremely important to progress and often times athletes will find that they get their best results after a period of forced rest the offseason and mid-season break are commonplace amongst pro cyclist for one simple reason it works\n10.  The research really couldn\u2019t be more clear lifting will make you a faster cyclist\n11.  You want to start lifting in the offseason when your training load is low and reduce or stop doing it as training volume gets high\n\nI will continue to add more of Dylan\u2019s suggestions here, but my key point is to **start with highly reputable coaches and coaching organizations that use evidence to support their suggestions.** This will reduce confusion and I believe you will find you see a lot more consensus across the different programs. Dylan has a lot of videos. Take notes on them (we will continue to do this). If you take his suggestions and build a cheat-sheet, you will start having solid principals to being your own coach.\n\n**Europe vs America**\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0xgaoVk6vxqund0VU.jpg)\n\nI am friends with one of the top European coaches. What I see is his big picture principals are similar to Dylan\u2019s.",

People in heavy race seasons need more recovery and might choose 2/1 as well as masters riders also frequently need more recovery. If at the end of 3 weeks you are feeling tired you might want to consider switch to the 2/1 pattern.\n\nYou also can see customize daily limits which allows you to put a limit on how long each ride is.\n\nHours at start of blocks should match what you are currently doing or what you plan on being at when you reach the start of this block. You can move it up or down a little but doing huge jumps up are risky.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1EU3ACrT4mvZKmT3Lk_2dgw.png)\n\nAs mentioned above pros start their season at level #1. They start out easy and by the end of the block get to a reasonable level of difficult. You do not need to train at your maximum level or any where close to failure. You can gradually build up so that your build block never feels too hard. Our pro coach advisor and the designer of these plans Andrea Morelli realizes this is not what most people preach. But Tour de France winners have used very similar plans so you can too. It just requires a change in thinking.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-15sXveVuIU5eu0t6y3ffoWA.png)\n\nYou also see ride feel above.

At first glance this article might appear to be a diversion from that. Let\u2019s get started.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that for most athletes sleep the most important aspect of recovery. Diet is important as well. Most of us recognize we can\u2019t go hard everyday forever. In many cases, older athletes break down faster than younger ones.

Many of us that have tried doing large amounts of training and start breaking down. So pros are super human, right? Well, yes, but there may be more to recovery than they have led us to believe or maybe we are just looking at it wrong.\n\nSo in the sports world, we have a lot of blanket rules. We also know that there is exceptions to every rule. We all wonder if we are the exception\u00a0:)\n\n**Strength gurus and trainable recovery**\n\nSo I have seen coaches directly discussing \u201crecovery adaption training,\u201d although the strength world is starting to bring it up. The cycling world, talks a lot about recovering more/better/faster but not improving recovery adaption itself.\n\nIn weight training, a common blanket rule is don\u2019t train the same muscle group two days in a row. Many times, coaches suggest not to do one muscle group more than once a week. Recent reputable sources are clarifying that it is might not be good advice in many cases. Some of the strongest guys in the past did 5+ days a week targeting the same muscles.\n\nI recently read a brilliant book by a serious genius called \u201cSquat Every Day.\u201d The squat is the most demanding strength movement and so this concept really goes against \u201cthe rules.\u201d Another guru in weight training is Mark Rippetoe of Starting Strength that has millions of views on his YouTube channel, says beginners should only do 3 sets because they recover faster and can train again sooner (in 48 to 72 hours). So why don\u2019t we take that farther and see what happens with 1-heavy set a day every day?\n\nHere is a somewhat comical video. I like this guy Allan Thrall. He is very much an expert in strength training. Here is he talking about trainable recovery.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfBizaDfvU8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfBizaDfvU8)\n\n**My experience in trainable recovery**\n\nAfter 45 and now at 56, I break down rather quickly, so my body requires lots of recovery. My sleep goes to hell, injuries and sickness crop up and I feel extra tired\u2026 My HRV tanks, my Garmin and/or Whoop say \u201cback off buddy.\u201d This especially occurs with regular anaerobic efforts. But!!! But something changed recently. I don\u2019t require as much recovery. Yes, I am sleeping pretty good and my diet is acceptable, but something is different.\n\nWe are getting into what seems to be an unexplored territory of science, or at least looking at it a different way. I asked a top science based cycling Coach Andrea Morelli what he thinks. His response was, \u201cIn the human body, everything is trainable. So yes, recovery should be trainable.\u201d I don\u2019t mean recovering faster. This is a different focus. This means training my body to require less recovery. It\u2019s hard to differentiate the two, but the way you approach them is very different.\n\nSo what am I saying here? Recovery adaption training is an uncharted territory but stands to provide significant benefits for us non-elite athletes. Beginners and masters athlete likely stand the most to gain.\n\n**Your Recovery Adaption Training Plan**\n\nBefore embarking on this journey, I suggest you make sure you have high-quality processes and self-awareness to know if you when you are heading down the ***over training*** path.",

If you used our app to record the workout you should show me the completed activity in TrainerDay vs the completed activity in IntervalsICU, meaning apples to apples to try to understand better. What you are seeing at the bottom of the page in intervals is the auto interval detection feature if I am not mistaken. Also if you are sending planned workouts from TD to intervals you could show me planned on both sides and see if they are different it\u2019s just too much in the middle of comparing planned to completed.\nSolution: Show completed activity in TrainerDay vs completed activity in IntervalsICU for better comparison.",

Note that it seems to be working for some activities and others not. The issue appears only with TrainerDay as my previous activities from MyWoosh or Zwift automatically appeared with intervals included (or detected): image2209\u00d71147 485 KB\nContext: User provided additional context about the issue.\nUser Problem: Some activities are detected with intervals while others are not.\nAnswer: Intervals is set to auto-detect like that. It works fine for intervals with higher intensity but low intensity, like a recovery ride, will just appear as one big block. Check the Use Laps checkbox and Intervals will use the intervals from the workout. At least, if they are written to the activity file. I\u2019m not 100% sure if they are because I never use the TrainerDay file. I always dual record with my bike computer and use that file. It pairs with a planned workout file in Intervals and takes the Intervals from there. From your screenshot, it looks like the workout targets are in the file. You can see the blue line in the background of the power stream. Try to Re-Analyze from the Actions menu and select \u2018Use Laps iso detecting intervals\u2019. That should give you all intervals.\nSolution: Check the Use Laps checkbox and try to Re-Analyze from the Actions menu.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Worked like a charm, thank you so much!\nAnswer:",

If you use a music player of some sort and press back it goes to the beginning of the song again, but if you press it quickly again then it goes to the previous song start. This is essentially a double click to get an \u201cinterval set.\u201d The problem is when you press next twice, the intervals are essentially deleted so back would just repeat what you previously did not what you removed unless we do some magic that makes it work like undo for a period of time but I think that makes it even more confusing. A temporary undo button would be safer. Navigating to a specifc point is a bit confusing too. Meaning after you navigate backwards then you don\u2019t want one power reading going over the top of the other one. You esentially want to extend the work, so once you click on the navigation point we need to insert the amount of work you selected. I think back button is safer or more clear.

Maybe two colours for the lines and you could move backward on the \u201cplanned graph\u201d and the recording \u201cseismographic needle\u201d is still working. But again my sense for coding made a turn 20 years ago. I had sometimes the problem that I double-tapped the screen by mistake and the intervall was \u201cgone\u201d. What about gestures? Two fingers swipe left backward and the same to the right. Yes it could confuse users or it could end as a hidden feature, but it could also be a solution.\n\nPost 8 by Alex:\nYes, lombo, you are right \u201cwe can remember everything.\u201d One of our testers also wants a gesture or a longer hold required for next making it more difficult to click twice on accient.

Is there a problem with the exported .fit file?\nContext: User is trying to upload workouts to intervals.icu.\nUser Problem: Inconsistent detection of interval markers in uploaded workouts.\nAnswer: I believe interval markers is a feature of intervals.icu and not something included in the fit fit file (I am pretty sure we don\u2019t include anything) so it would seem intervals is better at finding those intervals but maybe an intervals expert here can help clarify. @MedTechCD Want to help\nSolution: Suggests that the issue may be related to how intervals.icu handles interval markers.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thanks both for your fast replies! I think I have it figured out now. The first TrainerDay session that I uploaded to intervals.icu, intervals.icu had correctly identified the intervals itself. However, the second ride had \u201cmicro intervals\u201d and then these were not properly detected. Then, the third ride had only small intensity variations, so no intervals were detected. Still, after opening the exported .fit files in Strava, I could see all the lap markers were in the exported file. So, I then deleted the sessions in intervals.icu, activated \u201cUse laps for intervals\u201d in the Settings, and reimported the session .fit files. After doing this, I see all the laps from the TrainerDay session. I have now re-verified, and having \u201cKeep all laps\u201d activated is not enough. What had added to my confusion on this is that, when I do a TP programmed session outside using my Garmin, when the Garmin .fit file auto-uploads to intervals.icu, I see all the Garmin laps when only \u201cKeep all laps\u201d is activated in the Settings. Somehow, the TrainerDay .fit files require that \u201cKeep laps for intervals\u201d is also activated. However, maybe that is as it should be\u2026\nContext: User explains their troubleshooting process and findings.\nUser Problem: Confusion over settings required for proper interval detection.\nAnswer: I disagree on that\u2026 Every other app controlling structured workouts, logs step markers (laps). I have never used the FIT or TCX from Trainerday because I always dual record on my head unit, so can\u2019t be absolutely sure. But if Trainerday isn\u2019t logging a step marker in the output file, that is wrong behaviour because it should. I suggest you check it out and add steps asap if they are not included.\nSolution: Suggests checking the output file for step markers.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: dalex: Somehow, the TrainerDay .fit files require that \u201cKeep laps for intervals\u201d is also activated.

Here is what my comments look like image2242\u00d71068 191 KB image2116\u00d71780 387 KB I have a small video showing it working if you want to see it as well. here is a link to this test workout. app.trainerday.com \u2013 21 Feb 23 Swim Message Test\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nSorry, I should say you need to update to latest version of our app otherwise notifications at 0 offset don\u2019t show up. That was probably the issue you faced.",

        "text": "Blog Article: FTP Measures Aerobic - What About Anaerobic?\n\n#### Need some extra\u00a0power?\n\nIn cycling, aerobic power, measured by FTP, is not optional, it\u2019s what gets you in the game. But if you want to excel in MTB, cyclo-cross, or find yourself periodically get dropped in sprints with your buddies, you might need to build your anaerobic power.\n\nFTP, i.e. Functional Threshold Power, has become the most common term in performance cycling. It is great to have a single term to represent your cycling fitness level. It\u2019s very useful that it allows **AEROBIC** training to be easily and even automatically adjusted to the right intensity.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0XOzrJ9RinsaYnqv8.png)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0RRh402_XqybSuGBV.png)\n\n### The other energy system\u200a\u2014\u200aAnaerobic\n\nA deeper understanding of your fitness requires looking at both your aerobic and anaerobic abilities. If you take a ramp test, for example, your anaerobic power might noticeably affect your test, throwing off your FTP a little.\n\nDiscussing and thinking about anaerobic capacity seems to be scary for many cyclists, not the anaerobic training itself, but measuring anaerobic seems to be the scary part.\n\nMeasuring your anaerobic can be as simple as measuring your FTP and provide valuable insight and give you motivation when your FTP has flatlined.\n\n### Burning Matches\n\nCyclists like to call it burning matches, you only have so many to burn before your energy level crashes. The number of matches you have is your Anaerobic Work Capacity (AWC or W\u2019) We will use the term W\u2019 (pronounced W-Prime).\n\nMonitoring your personal W\u2019 will give you insight to your Anaerobic Work Capacity. Weight lifting is anaerobic and both it and anaerobic cycling follow similar principals. Imagine going to the gym, lifting weights but not tracking or even measuring your progress. Just grab a random set of weights and lift them a random number of times. Similar to lifting weights, building your W\u2019 requires training close to or to failure. Doing the correct amount of exercise will provide more predictable results, allowing your body to repair and build itself. We could all use a few more matches.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0TOqNMHh15K4t9Q0D.png)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0bN-mxf7XLySPsZrM.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0bSajC43XgSgjMdbg.jpg)\n\n### Light bulbs and your Electricity bill\n\nWe have been comfortable using watts for lightbulbs and hair-dryers for a long time, and with the popularity of power meters we are comfortable using watts on our bikes. The watts measurement is instantaneous, it has no time. You can say \u201cwatts for 10-seconds\u201d but watts themselves have no time. So when talking about energy, we need to include time. This unit of measurement is kilojoules (kJ). A joule is 1-watt for 1-second. Kilojoules are on your electricity bill. You measure your W\u2019 in kilojoules. You likely have a W\u2019 between 5\u201340kJ. That is a fixed number of watts for a fixed amount of time.\n\n### W\u2019s amazing\u00a0cousin\n\nSo one of the incredible benefits of knowing your W\u2019 along with your FTP is with our new feature in our workout creator, you can find or design intervals that precisely fit your fitness profile.\n\nFor example, you are doing 2-minute VO2Max intervals. How long should the rests be? And should the intervals be at 120% or 125%? Welcome to W\u2019 Balance (W\u2019Bal) this is W\u2019s perfect cousin. Scientific studies have show that W\u2019Bal can accurately predict when you will hit failure. It\u2019s sounds scary, but it is surprisingly simple. We will explain how it works in part #3 of this series.\n\n!",

        "text": "All training increases your VO2max as it is primarily a function of aerobic improvement and running/cycling/swimming economy. So not sure how good of base you have now but think in terms of base, build, peak. Base you could spend 6-months doing purely low intensity making sure your body is very well recovered and very prepared for 6 months of increasingly harder and harder efforts. Totally with you on this. Elite athletes doing the very hard Vo2 sessions on regular schedule, are those who have build a large base over several years. And they\u2019re not doing them year round. They do those hard sessions in the peak phase and can sustain them thanks to their large base fitness. Remember that Seiler nuanced the meaning of \u2018hard sessions\u2019 and is no longer advocating only LIT and HIIT. That was modified to LIT for anything under LT1 and \u2018hard\u2019 for anything above that. And still only 1 out of 5 sessions goes into that bucket of \u2018hard\u2019. I advocated before that even a session around LT1, can be a hard session, if you make it long enough. As you say, all training improves VO2max, but enough time in lower intensity, moves the whole curve up, while short hard efforts (HIIT) mainly improve the shorter duration part of the curve and do very little for the longer duration. And that\u2019s why I said to get in as much time as possible while mixing it up with higher intensity if less then 90 min of time is available. The mix of that will work the whole curve up while avoiding injury and high fatigue. If you have the time to ride 3+ hours, do it and keep effort low enough to properly recover for your next session. If you find yourself with 4 hours of available time but your legs are to heavy to do them (because of a too long and heavy session the day before), you will gain less.\n\nPost 10 by dthrog00:\nI mistyped 40 km time trial not minutes.

        "text": "Increase Aerobic Power: VO2 max workouts increase the power and speed you can maintain aerobically. This is particularly beneficial for endurance sports, as it allows for higher sustained speeds. Enhance Recovery Ability: Regularly performing high-intensity workouts can improve your body\u2019s ability to recover between efforts. This is due to improved blood flow and increased efficiency in clearing metabolic byproducts from the muscles. Boost Overall Performance: By improving aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, and recovery, VO2 max workouts contribute to overall athletic performance. This is particularly important in sports that require sustained efforts, such as cycling, running, and rowing. Typical VO2 Max Workouts VO2 max workouts generally involve high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which includes: Intervals: Short bursts of high-intensity exercise (e.g., 3-5 minutes) at or near your VO2 max, followed by rest or low-intensity periods. Tabata Intervals: Very short, extremely high-intensity intervals (20 seconds on, 10 seconds off) repeated multiple times. Hill Repeats: Running or cycling up a hill at high intensity, then recovering on the way down or on flat ground. Pyramids: Gradually increasing the duration of high-intensity intervals, followed by decreasing them in a pyramid-like structure. Implementation Tips Progress Gradually: Start with shorter, less intense intervals and gradually increase the duration and intensity as your fitness improves. Monitor Intensity: Use heart rate monitors, power meters, or perceived exertion scales to ensure you are working at the correct intensity. Rest and Recovery: Allow adequate recovery between intervals and ensure proper rest days between VO2 max workouts to prevent overtraining. Periodization: Incorporate VO2 max workouts into your training plan strategically, usually during the build phase leading up to key events or races. In summary, VO2 max workouts are a critical component of a well-rounded training program aimed at enhancing aerobic capacity, improving cardiovascular efficiency, and boosting overall athletic performance.\n\nPost 3 by Alex:\n@Robert_UCL Robert, what do you think? I think your answer is likely even better than mine, or at least can add value for sure.\n\nPost 4 by Robert_UCL:\nHi Leigh, Coach Robert here. What you are describing is that you see your heart rate increasing during a 30/15 workout. That is entirely normal. This is a very hard workout to do and heart rate is not the best way to monitor this. It takes te body some time to respond. Around 30-60 seconds. So when your first 30 sec are over your heart rate will still be rising. But then you take a 15 sec rest. That first rest is just enough to stop the increase and, if you\u2019re in really good shape, might even show a slow decrease. During the first set the body will fatigue and you will be short on oxygen. After a couple of reps the body realizes that this situation is not going to get better and oxygen demand stays high. Therefore the heart will elevate slightly during the set. The next set you already start with some fatigue. That is why the heart rate will increase even more. In general, it will take the body around 3 minutes to reach a steady state. Provided that the effort stays the same. Since the rest is so short, the level of effort stays fairly simular. However, it is so high that the body builds up oxygen deprivation, free radicals, lactate, and ions. The pain you feel in the legs is not lactate. It is H-ions. We used to believe that it was lactate, but actually, lactate is a byproduct that serves as an energy provider at lower intensities. So, with this in mind, what should you do? My first advice is to do this workout as it is. Don\u2019t go harder in earlier reps and don\u2019t go easier in later reps. If you go harder you will burn out to soon. You need those \u201ceasier\u201d reps to get to the end. Same as you need the intensity at the end to make the difference. Follow this routine for 4 weeks, than move on to a different workout.",

It\u2019s better to start under your maximum and slowly increase so you can handle it.

If you do short mtb races, you will do short climbs and you want to focus on 1-2 minutes of vo2 power. If you do road races you might want to get ahead of the peloton and do 4-5 minutes of vo2 power. For short intervals guiding with a powermeter works better than heart rate. These intervals are great, but don\u2019t forget you don\u2019t have to bury yourself to do a great workout.

You can just search Maffetone 180 or ask chatGPT to understand his test.\n\nPost 9 by MedTechCD:\nRobert_UCL: However, if your Threshold is already 146, you have a good aerobic base. Keep that up. I was going to say the exact same thing. If the lab test was done correctly and the measuring devices were calibrated, the test results should be trusted. VT1 sits at an RER of ~0.80 and VT2 at RER=1. And RER (respiratory exchange rate = respiratory quotient = VCO2/VO2) is much more reliable then lactate testing (if the MET cart is functioning correctly). But I am surprised that an LT1 at 146 comes out with a HRmax at 184. Or is this 184, the max during the test and not your true max HR? Elite riders can have a VT1 that is very close to VT2 (only about 10-15bpm separate), but that is the result of many years of consistent training and a volume that you can only get to if you are a pro. If you are in that case, training at VT1 is clearly hard work. Your cardiovascular system has been trained to achieve that result, but the strain on the muscle system is high at such an output. If you want AeT efficiency, and decoupling calculated for you, use Intervals.icu. It has those parameters by default analysed. The Power/HR quotient is something you can use for the entire aerobic zone as a \u2018sub-max\u2019 test. It allows to follow up progress without doing an all out FTP test. Check decoupling for the duration of the events you\u2019re targeting. If you have significant decoupling after 2 hours, you\u2019re not ready to go ride a Grand Fondo of 5-6 hours. Check both efficiency and decoupling at different intensities below VT2.\n\nPost 10 by BlackTek:\nThank you @Robert_UCL and @Alex - I really appreciate your feedbacks. I\u2019ll do the test tomorrow early morning (wake-up at 04:15 am to finish by 7am and bring kids at school :)) I\u2019ll do the test like this: I\u2019ve verified from past the last workout that my bpm is normally quite low until I start going above 70% FTP. Last Saturday it was 130bpm at 78% ftp (over 5 minutes after 15 minutes warm-up) After the AeT I\u2019ll do my next workout from CJ (I\u2019ll just skip first cooldown and second warmup to stay in more or less 2 hours): image812\u00d7424 20 KB I\u2019ll share the results, perhaps a nice discussion to elaborate the results will start.

Thank you again!\n\nPost 11 by BlackTek:\ndo you think it\u2019s ok to do the test without breakfast and just an espresso coffee? Coffee might impact HR a bit, but I take 6-7 per day, so it\u2019s part of my regular schedule. Probably better to don\u2019t ingest carbs or other things. For me it\u2019s fine to do like that for all AeT tests (and in the end it\u2019s better to avoid sugars around, to give a stronger signal to the body to use fat, despite 80\u2019 test is really short)\n\nPost 12 by Alex:\nIt\u2019s sounding like you have a very good aerobic base 5-time Ironman winner Mark Allen followed low hr training and when his base was very strong he would do intervals at AeT because it was not easy. I experienced this to some degree as well about 12 years ago. Would love to hear your test results but if you have a very optimized aerobic system you may not see a ton of progress.

        "text": "I lean towards a lab scientist any how (Engineer by wallet is my preference, you never know until you put it on the road). After a bunch of research and self-testing, we used this to coach up an over 50 mixed-gender RAAM relay team of four. Using this approach, they broke the record for a team of four. ((Granted they are also exceptional athletes to start with)) I modeled this success back to a structured training approach with those roots. (Yes that opening is a mess because it discusses the past with the foresight of the future) So on to it, first FTP everything is FTP. FTP is a blessing and a curse. It\u2019s time to move beyond FTP and start thinking about Critical Power and specifically Critical Aerobic Power and Critical Anerobic Power. If you know your CAP(s), you know your abilities. Failing back on MAF is the way to make this transition easier. Very few of us will go out and do the ventilatory testing to figure out what our Aerobic thresholds are, and we don\u2019t have to if we are either (1) starting training off the couch, (2) already well-trained at the end of a season. In those cases, the formulas Phil put forth do work. Only the 3rd group of Time crunched \u201cfit,\u201d but unfit people will struggle because that\u2019s not about training. It\u2019s about ego and bro science. Ok, so MAF first, let\u2019s go with the most robust stance. MAF_Basis = 180 - age If you are severely detrained or currently sick, then MAF_Adjust1 = -10 Else MAF_Adjust1 = 0 EndIF If you take daily medicine that has a liver load (aka heart meds, allergy meds), then MAF_Adjust2 = -5 Else MAF_Adjust2 = 0 EndIF If MAF_Adjust1 + MAF_Adjust2 = 0 and you have been athletically training for three years plus without a significant injury, then. MAF_Adjust3 = +5 Else MAF_Adjust3 = 0 EndIF So with those in hand, we know that the final estimate that works for pretty much everyone is MAF_Threshold_Estimate = MAF_Basis + MAF_Adjust1 + MAF_Adjust2 + MAF_Adjust3 Now you have your MAF_TE to work with. And, of course, everyone in group three believes that (MAF_Basis + MAF_Adjust3) is them and that it\u2019s too low. And reality shows that 90% of people are really (MAF_Basis - 15) Ok, hopefully, you\u2019re with me so far. That part was the easy part; here\u2019s the part I will have time to cover today Let\u2019s look at how we\u2019d use an existing training software with a similar name to TrainerDay and one with Volcanoes. In that software, we work with FTP, and for this exercise, during the BASE building phase, we will treat Critical Aerobic Power as FTP as displayed in those apps. Start with a Traditional base plan that is a low-volume or mid-volume plan in said software. One that\u2019s 100% endurance riding with recovery weeks. Watch out for things that claim to be traditional-based but have tempo and other work in them for \u201cvariety\u201d. Also, an Endurance ride is always >= 90 minutes. You will have to delete tempo work and find endurance work from prebuilt plans. (If you have a training-peaks account, you can get me to build your plans, and I\u2019ll load one of many combinations for you, but really anyone can do it). If you are off the couch, guess your FTP and enter it into the software.",

I know Joe Friel suggests < 5% decoupling is good. I am not sure how much heat is affecting you, because if you are heating up I would also consider this good. If do happen to be well ventilated, at a reasonably low temperature, I think either you have room for aerobic improvement or you also could try the same test with 130bpm and see what happens. What was your breathing like? How easy did it feel compared to going on a walk? If you were really following Maffetone\u2019s suggestions then it feels too easy for most people when they start doing efforts like this. Also focus on deep breadths and you will see your power go up\u2026 but most important from test to test is consistency. So just from a test perspective to compare to the future this seems good.\n\nPost 20 by BlackTek:\nThank you @Alex ! yes, <5% is good (source) Heat was ok, temperatura in the room with HT is 15\u00b0. I forgot to switch on the second fan, I did at the start of the third segment, and you see that power went up. I\u2019ve drunk water every 2 intervals (every 10 minutes) The breathing was not like walking, it was ok, I surely was able to talk, but surely not like resting / easy walking. It was harder to keep 180w steady on the HT, the thing I dislike is that you never rest/pause/coast like on a real bike But it was ok. Yes, I focused on deep breadths, and tried to be constand with rpm (but not a perfect job with rpm). I did the test without breakfast, and I also forgot my espresso I think that at 130bpm is not taxing enough, and the stimolous is not very good (in terms of training). But this is still unknown territory for me. In terms of power it was low-Z3 for me. How to understand/decide if it\u2019s better to ride at lower/higher bpm to train aerobic endurance? The decoupling was good, so surely it was exclusively aerobic work. Right?",

        "text": "It is H-ions. We used to believe that it was lactate, but actually, lactate is a byproduct that serves as an energy provider at lower intensities. So, with this in mind, what should you do? My first advice is to do this workout as it is. Don\u2019t go harder in earlier reps and don\u2019t go easier in later reps. If you go harder you will burn out to soon. You need those \u201ceasier\u201d reps to get to the end. Same as you need the intensity at the end to make the difference. Follow this routine for 4 weeks, than move on to a different workout. There are many different VO2 max workouts. Al lot of them have different training goals. For the 30/15\u2019s the goal is to build up lactate. The rest is to short to let the body recover. That is different from 1 minute zone 5 followed by 1 minute of rest. In that workout the aim will be to let you recover just enough before your next effort. In the end you have to look at what you need in a race. If you\u2019re riding gran fondo\u2019s for fun there is not really a difference. These workouts will build you more power. If you do short mtb races, you will do short climbs and you want to focus on 1-2 minutes of vo2 power. If you do road races you might want to get ahead of the peloton and do 4-5 minutes of vo2 power. For short intervals guiding with a powermeter works better than heart rate. These intervals are great, but don\u2019t forget you don\u2019t have to bury yourself to do a great workout.

Specifically what to change to make the workout better for me and if I\u2019m hitting the right targets. So I did the Ultimate HIIT workout with 3 sets of 30/15\u2019s, at the end of the first set my HR was at around 154/5, on the next 2 sets I was hitting 163/4, if I was to change it to get the most effect from it would I be better adding an effort at the beginning with a minute gap before the sets, or would I see better results from adding 5 seconds to each effort or upping the watts by 5%. What is the ultimate goal for VO2 efforts to get adaptations\u2026 Thanks all that have made it to this part. Cheers Leigh.\nContext: User is seeking advice on improving a specific workout and understanding heart rate targets.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about how to optimize the workout for better results.\nAnswer: Hi, funny, I just went on a ride and was thinking about how to answer this question\u2026 Let\u2019s just say this question can result in a million different opinions. The easiest answer is what is the reason for doing that. I just asked ChatGPT and this is a reasonable answer (see lower on this response). So in general you are talking about nuanced differences and while someone might sound really smart and give a solid reason why one or the other, this is highly individual and no one really know what is going to work better for you. Enter the workout fully recovered, get a good warmup and I believe if you take a structure approach to slowly increasing intensity or duration then ultimately it does not matter what you do, the difference would be so small and you would never know. If one sounds more fun then the other, take the fun one We are strong believers here in the last part of ChatGPT\u2019s answer which is * Progress Gradually: Start with shorter, less intense intervals and gradually increase the duration and intensity as your fitness improves. We (Including my partner and top pro coach) would say pros should take this exact same approach. Start out lighter and gradually increase. I probably did not give you the best answer but it\u2019s our beliefs around here. ChatGPT VO2 max workouts, also known as maximal oxygen uptake workouts, are designed to improve an athlete\u2019s aerobic capacity and overall cardiovascular fitness. Here are the key reasons behind incorporating VO2 max workouts into a training regimen: Increase Maximum Oxygen Uptake: VO2 max represents the maximum amount of oxygen your body can utilize during intense exercise. By improving VO2 max, your body becomes more efficient at transporting and using oxygen, which enhances endurance and performance. Enhance Cardiovascular Efficiency: VO2 max workouts help strengthen the heart and improve the efficiency of the cardiovascular system. This leads to a greater volume of blood being pumped with each heartbeat and more efficient oxygen delivery to working muscles. Improve Lactate Threshold: High-intensity intervals push the body to work at or near its lactate threshold, which helps to increase the point at which lactate begins to accumulate in the blood. This means you can sustain higher intensities for longer periods before fatigue sets in. Increase Aerobic Power: VO2 max workouts increase the power and speed you can maintain aerobically. This is particularly beneficial for endurance sports, as it allows for higher sustained speeds. Enhance Recovery Ability: Regularly performing high-intensity workouts can improve your body\u2019s ability to recover between efforts. This is due to improved blood flow and increased efficiency in clearing metabolic byproducts from the muscles. Boost Overall Performance: By improving aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, and recovery, VO2 max workouts contribute to overall athletic performance. This is particularly important in sports that require sustained efforts, such as cycling, running, and rowing. Typical VO2 Max Workouts VO2 max workouts generally involve high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which includes: Intervals: Short bursts of high-intensity exercise (e.g., 3-5 minutes) at or near your VO2 max, followed by rest or low-intensity periods.",

        "text": "ah, last but not least: you\u2019re right about the warm-up, probably it\u2019s not good like that. It was a my idea to push the HR a bit high and avoid to stay at very low HR for a long. How does the HR target work in your app? doesn\u2019t it increase the intensity of the HomeTrainer until the HR is in target? in such case at a certain point I think it will start using carbs to increase it quickly. Could you please elaborate a bit how it works? perhaps I can remove that initial part like this? The second 10\u2019 interval is to arrive at HR target. I might also split the 2x30\u2019 main intervals (used to calculate decoupling) in 12x5\u2019, but I\u2019m not sure that the power on those intervals would change a lot, the effort expected is quite low, and the power output I expect is quite steady. Tnx again\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nYours is fine but I would actually enter 5 minute intervals, then it is very easy to compare. Like below image1090\u00d7570 42.8 KB I am on vacation and heading out skiing now so will respond more later.\n\nPost 6 by BlackTek:\nOk, I\u2019ll shift to 12 x 5\u2019 minutes interval. Just a little bit more work/math to later calculate the average on two blocks of 30 minutes - but not a big deal Enjoy your skiing, talk to you later!\n\nPost 7 by Robert_UCL:\nThis is a very nice discussion. I completely agree with everything Alex has said. You need to remember that though the threshold was tested on that particular day at 146, this does not mean that this is the number you should be crunching on all of your aerobic efforts or tests. As it is a threshold and your body is not in the same shape every day or week, one day, you\u2019ll be under the threshold at 146, and the next day, you\u2019ll be over the threshold at that same 146. It only indicates that training needs to be done well below 146. However, if your Threshold is already 146, you have a good aerobic base. Keep that up. You did a great job lowering the intensity of that warm-up. Going slow is really the key here. Have fun, Coach Robert\n\nPost 8 by Alex:\nYes, I have experienced as Joe suggests that if I have a strong aerobic base and I am 100% below AeT. I have 0% decoupling. Maffetone suggest something similar, so yes keeping it for an 1:20 you should be able see this. Which tells you two things. Is your target too high and do you have a good base. Each person is a bit different so I would never assume everyone is exactly the same but it\u2019s just a very good indicator. So if you wanted to do 2 long intervals after the 5 x 5\u2019 intervals they you could easily just in TrainerDay compare the first long one to the second long one average power and see if there is any decoupling but any of the analysis apps will also show this. Maffetone\u2019s big book is good. Most of his books have the same core information. You can just search Maffetone 180 or ask chatGPT to understand his test.\n\nPost 9 by MedTechCD:\nRobert_UCL: However, if your Threshold is already 146, you have a good aerobic base. Keep that up. I was going to say the exact same thing. If the lab test was done correctly and the measuring devices were calibrated, the test results should be trusted. VT1 sits at an RER of ~0.80 and VT2 at RER=1. And RER (respiratory exchange rate = respiratory quotient = VCO2/VO2) is much more reliable then lactate testing (if the MET cart is functioning correctly). But I am surprised that an LT1 at 146 comes out with a HRmax at 184. Or is this 184, the max during the test and not your true max HR?",

        "text": "Back in the days where even HR monitors were not existing, champions did that kind of intervals on a hill. They estimated effort based on RPE and crested that hill 8 or 10 or more times as prescribed by the coach. You would be amazed how good they were at judging their effort without any live information. Just a stopwatch to record the time needed to go up that hill. And the last one was almost exactly the same as the first one, but on the last one they were cooked. RobertS: more realistic HR targets Those targets will be different for each and every athlete, and will vary a lot from day to day. For VO2max workouts, you can set HR targets because the goal of those is to accumulate as much time as possible at a HR above 90% of max HR. The VO2max HIT workouts are typically short hard bursts with short rests, 30-30sec or 40-20sec for example. The goal is to get you in te correct HR zone and keep you there for as long as possible to have maximal TIZ and adaptation. You have both Power and HR, so there\u2019s no need to make things more complicated. Just use them wisely for the type of workout you\u2019re doing. Endurance and eventually longer Tempo work can be done with HR. Anything higher intensity is best done with power.\n\nPost 15 by RobertS:\nI don\u2019t want to do hiit on heart rate alone I wanted to be sure that a hiit with hr in zone 2 is a hiit\n\nPost 16 by Alex:\nAre you saying you want your HR to drop down to Zone 2 between intervals? If so I would say that is not HIIT by any normal definition. Top athletes might have incredible heart rate recovery and it drops a lot very quickly but even then I highly doubt it would drop to zone 2. HIIT is more about compounding intervals and if you get fully recovered from an HR perspective you would be fully recovered from one interval to the next and in theory could do it almost all day long. I should say I am still confused into what you are actually trying to accomplish.\n\nPost 17 by RobertS:\nNo, what I see is that my heart rate stays in zone 2 most of the time. So my question was if that is ok for a Hitt workout or that I have to do the workout on a higher power level than the targets in the workout. I am not a top athlete and I don\u2019t understand why you bring up their heart rate. I don\u2019t think I will become a top athlete by following a coach jack plan with 3 workouts a week ;-).\n\nPost 18 by Alex:\nOk I am starting to understand. I totally misunderstood, I thought you were trying to say something totally diffent is why I brought up top athletes. So \u201ceveryone\u201d prescribes Aneraobic workouts, such as HIIT based on FTP % but in reality for some people this can be very wrong. If you are strong or a sprinter type of profie for example, or just a low FTP compared to your strength. We have articles on W\u2019 (pronounced w-prime) talking about this problem on our blog. It\u2019s your anaerobic work capacity. It\u2019s estimated that 80% of the people are average, but 20% are not. I also am not. Traditional HIIT is pretty easy for me as well. All I do is press the plus button in our app until I get to a place that it feels pretty hard but I am sure I could do more intervals at the end. My current FTP is low but strength is moderate so I could do that workout above at about 180% or possibly 200% of FTP if I really wanted to suffer. I think HIIT is better done by feel like this, so the plus button in our app is perfect for that.",

The test that Friel recommends is basically to ride at the AeT for 1-2-3 hours and see how the output power compares over time. If Power/HR increases it means that AeT efficiency/capacity is improving. In my case I\u2019ve already made a laboratory test in a training center (with the mask while riding) and my thresholds are: VT1: 146bpm - load 155W - O2 23,2 ml/min/kg - RER 0,84 VT2: 171bpm - load 260W - O2 40,3 ml/min/kg - RER 0,99 VT3: 181bpm - load 305W - O2 48,1 ml/min/kg - RER 1,05 My CFmax was 184bpm. I\u2019ve created a workout, where after some warmup I ride for 2x30 min at 140bpm (this way I can also calculate HR decoupling (drift?) of the fist half/second half: Are You Fit? All About Aerobic Endurance and Decoupling) I\u2019m not sure that riding with HR target 140bpm is correct, and staying exactly at 146bpm seems even worser. It seems very high to me, with a quite big effort (135 seems reasonable to me). I\u2019ve read somewhere that the test should be made at 10-15 bpm under VT1. In other places they recommend to stay at VT1. Doing the test the other way around by fixing the watt (eg 160W) seems not very comparable over time when my FTP will (hopefully) increase. I\u2019ve read that HR zones are quite fixed, while Power zones not. What is your recommendation/opinion? I\u2019m interested at comparing AvgPower/AvgHR over time.\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nNice question. I don\u2019t know much about lab testing for AeT or how those O2 values exactly relate. I do know VT1 should be the same as AeT but to me 146bpm seems very high with a max HR around 184. People are different. I do think the accepted belief is below AeT should feel very easy and sustainable for many hours with no problem for any trained cyclist\u2026 I could ask Andrea about the specifics of these numbers as he has been mask testing cyclists for 30 years\u2026 but I from my perspective that is not necessary. If you read Maffetone, he has been focused on AeT for a very long time and his area of expertise. More so than Joe, although I respect Joe and the cycling training bible a lot. Anyway. Maffetone\u2019s aerobic test is much simpler to execute. Converting his from running to cycling I would say. Use standardized warmup protocol that slowly brings your HR up over 12-15 minutes to your target. Then hold your HR in a tight range using consistent breathing patterns and minimize pre-ride eating as it affects your HR a lot. Then at 20 minutes compare your power in 5 minute increments. So 20-25,25-30, 30-35, 35-40\u2026 And just do that once a week for example and watch the pattern to compare previous weeks and your power should go up for all of them but some times you will only see increments of one of those. Maffetone believes their is almost no risk by going to low of target, but going to high can stall progress. Many of his followers have experienced the same, myself included. So if it was me I would likely start around 130bpm\u2026 or a value that your breadth does not really change from doing nothing. Maybe a slight change, but more like walking\u2026 Conversation is just like going on a walk.",

So I did the Ultimate HIIT workout with 3 sets of 30/15\u2019s, at the end of the first set my HR was at around 154/5, on the next 2 sets I was hitting 163/4, if I was to change it to get the most effect from it would I be better adding an effort at the beginning with a minute gap before the sets, or would I see better results from adding 5 seconds to each effort or upping the watts by 5%. What is the ultimate goal for VO2 efforts to get adaptations\u2026 Thanks all that have made it to this part. Cheers Leigh.\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nHi, funny, I just went on a ride and was thinking about how to answer this question\u2026 Let\u2019s just say this question can result in a million different opinions. The easiest answer is what is the reason for doing that. I just asked ChatGPT and this is a reasonable answer (see lower on this response). So in general you are talking about nuanced differences and while someone might sound really smart and give a solid reason why one or the other, this is highly individual and no one really know what is going to work better for you. Enter the workout fully recovered, get a good warmup and I believe if you take a structure approach to slowly increasing intensity or duration then ultimately it does not matter what you do, the difference would be so small and you would never know. If one sounds more fun then the other, take the fun one We are strong believers here in the last part of ChatGPT\u2019s answer which is * Progress Gradually: Start with shorter, less intense intervals and gradually increase the duration and intensity as your fitness improves. We (Including my partner and top pro coach) would say pros should take this exact same approach. Start out lighter and gradually increase. I probably did not give you the best answer but it\u2019s our beliefs around here. ChatGPT VO2 max workouts, also known as maximal oxygen uptake workouts, are designed to improve an athlete\u2019s aerobic capacity and overall cardiovascular fitness. Here are the key reasons behind incorporating VO2 max workouts into a training regimen: Increase Maximum Oxygen Uptake: VO2 max represents the maximum amount of oxygen your body can utilize during intense exercise. By improving VO2 max, your body becomes more efficient at transporting and using oxygen, which enhances endurance and performance. Enhance Cardiovascular Efficiency: VO2 max workouts help strengthen the heart and improve the efficiency of the cardiovascular system. This leads to a greater volume of blood being pumped with each heartbeat and more efficient oxygen delivery to working muscles. Improve Lactate Threshold: High-intensity intervals push the body to work at or near its lactate threshold, which helps to increase the point at which lactate begins to accumulate in the blood. This means you can sustain higher intensities for longer periods before fatigue sets in. Increase Aerobic Power: VO2 max workouts increase the power and speed you can maintain aerobically. This is particularly beneficial for endurance sports, as it allows for higher sustained speeds. Enhance Recovery Ability: Regularly performing high-intensity workouts can improve your body\u2019s ability to recover between efforts. This is due to improved blood flow and increased efficiency in clearing metabolic byproducts from the muscles. Boost Overall Performance: By improving aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, and recovery, VO2 max workouts contribute to overall athletic performance. This is particularly important in sports that require sustained efforts, such as cycling, running, and rowing. Typical VO2 Max Workouts VO2 max workouts generally involve high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which includes: Intervals: Short bursts of high-intensity exercise (e.g., 3-5 minutes) at or near your VO2 max, followed by rest or low-intensity periods.",

Thanks for sharing.\n\nPost 16 by Robert_UCL:\nHi Ludvig, Congrats on becoming a father again, and deep respect for your Iron man lifestyle. There isn\u2019t much to say other than to emphasize again that the Iron man is a pure aerobic effort. You could periodically mix in in some/ a high intensity interval session, but your main focus should be aerobic training. You say you want to keep things simple. I don\u2019t think it can be simpler than just riding zone 2 whenever you can. Mix in a high-intensity effort once a week. It is a good way to build power and avoid boredom, but many athletes rely solely on zone 2 to achieve good results. However, there are very few athletes who do Iron man races on just vo2max sessions. For any Iron man race every zone 2 hour counts. Another possibility I would advice you to consider is doing a half iron man if you really can\u2019t free up enough time to train. Have fun, Coach Robert\n\nPost 17 by MedTechCD:\nInteresting article on the need (or not) for VO2 training: feelthebyrn.substack.com The Physics of Performance - Part Four Do I Need A VO2 Block?\n\nPost 18 by Alex:\nThat guy is interesting. He only talks about himself like he is more athlete than coach and he does not back up any of his claims but at the same time he says really good stuff and explains his ideas in a really nice format. It\u2019s really great when top athletes explain that they do things what we consider the right way to approach training. Thanks for sharing. This is actually more of the direction I would like to take TrainerDay assessments/evaluations. Giving people a clear story as to why they fit into a specific categorization and why it makes sense to more metabolic/base training.",

        "text": "Blog Article: Designing The Perfect Interval Workout Using W'bal\n\n#### Starting with Progressive Overload\n\nAs most of you likely know, one of the key fundamentals of exercise is progressive overload. This means if you want to get stronger you need to go to failure or at least close to failure to tell your body it needs to repair itself and get stronger so next time this same exercise is easy.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0xYyOCvibyEmEczap.jpg)\n\n### How many intervals should I be\u00a0doing?\n\nEveryone knows that they have a limited amount of time, that they can sustain a hard-effort. We can clarify hard-effort as anything above your FTP. But how much time is that exactly? Meaning should I do four 2-minutes intervals @ 120% or maybe they should be 2:15 not 2-minutes. Since each athlete has a unique amount of anaerobic capacity (W\u2019). You should train with custom intervals matched to your personal W\u2019. You can hunt by trial and error, or you can use this cool TrainerDay feature called W\u2019 Balance (W\u2019Bal). This same feature has been in GoldenCheetah for a long time, but we feel we simplified it.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0ysY46bOrDhfas0UX.jpg)\n\n### Finding the perfect interval\u00a0workouts\n\nThis is a fairly deep subject but just starting with the basics is a huge step forward and something that many workout authors overlook. So for this article we are talking about intervals above your FTP. You want to tax your anaerobic system with just the right stimulus.\n\nThe basic idea is when you are above FTP your anaerobic work capacity (AWC or W\u2019) diminishes. Many people also call this \u201cburning matches.\u201d You only have so many matches to burn. Although when you drop below your FTP your W\u2019 recovers, or the match book fills back up, slowly. The great news is we have added W\u2019Bal to our workout creator.\n\n### 5000+ Is Too Many\u00a0Choices\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0WVmL4pI8fTbu_xpU.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0aQCWEwrcemsHW-_X.png)\n\nI would like to point out, I don\u2019t feel a 10-minute warm-up is enough, it should be closer to 20. It just improved the visibility in this example.\n\n### How to use the W\u2019Bal Calculator\n\nTurn on the W\u2019Bal feature. Enter your FTP or if you know it your CP in the CP box. Enter your W\u2019 ([how to calculate](https://trainerday.com/how-to-calculate-your-critical-power-cp-and-w/)) and you are good to go.\n\nThe red line shows you\u2019re predicted remaining energy and you can see at the end of this set of intervals your remaining energy is at the bottom this W\u2019Bal predicts you are completly fatigued at the end of the intervals. Perfect.\n\nMany scientific studies have proven the validity of these formulas.\n\nIn this example on the left, if you have a W\u2019 of 20kJ, and a FTP of 200, with those intervals, you will burn all your matches. The interesting thing is if you had a 300w FTP, you could not complete this workout (read [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|this article]] to find out why).

W\u2019Bal shows that it is \u201ceasy.\u201d That is because W\u2019Bal is not about easy or hard. It only looks at what is above FTP (anaerobic) and sees if it it is possible. Don\u2019t use W\u2019Bal for anything close to or below your FTP. See below. The cutoff of when it get\u2019s useful is individual but I would say somewhere around 115% of FTP and above. It\u2019s generally good for VO2max and above.

Why the W\u2019 balance goes down there? I knew that we use the W\u2019 \u201cfuel\u201d only when the current power is above CP. Basically (Current_Power - CP) * duration_in_seconds is the amount of Joules used from the W\u2019balance (when Current_Power > CP) Thank you!\nContext: User is analyzing their training data and is confused about the W' balance calculation.\nUser Problem: Understanding why W' balance decreases during intervals below CP.\nAnswer: Seems there is a bug, it is using your FTP as your CP\u2026 We will get this fixed.\nSolution: Identified a bug in the calculation using FTP instead of CP.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Yes, I thought the same, that it uses FTP instead of CP\nContext: User agrees with Alex's assessment of the issue.\nUser Problem: Confirmation of the suspected bug affecting calculations.\nAnswer: There are two sides to this problem. Their is the CP, W\u2019 calculation and then there is the W\u2019bal calculation. The problem is the W\u2019bal method we are using only takes 2 parameters so this ends up making the two methods work very inversely similar. None of this stuff is exact science\u2026 it\u2019s just a ballpark that is much closer than using FTP only.\nSolution: Explained the relationship between CP and W' calculations.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: W\u2019bal is obvious math, right? (power-CP)*seconds CP, W\u2019 are based on models and you\u2019ll have more/less screwed figures based on the model and on your individuality (if you\u2019re a super strong sprinter or a super strong time trialist the model probably will not work perfectly - and in opposite directions) In theory CP is the effort you can sustain over 30/40 minutes, while FTP on 60 minutes - and this is the reason that CP is normally a little bit above FTP. This is at least what I\u2019ve understood so far\nContext: User is trying to clarify their understanding of W' balance and its calculations.\nUser Problem: Clarifying the relationship between CP, FTP, and W' balance.\nAnswer: That\u2019s all an over simplification Again trying to map math to physiology is always a rough estimate. There are always tons of exceptions to everything. Focusing on the basics is enough.\nSolution: Encouraged focusing on basics and acknowledged the complexity of mapping math to physiology.",

Let me start by saying this is not an easy workout. In VO2max training, the rest often defines the purpose of the workout. In this workout, there seems to be a 1: 1 ratio. It takes about 10 minutes to complete two full cycles, so intervals are approximately 2.5 minutes. With 6 reps, the total training time is around 15 minutes. That is about the most time you want to spend in this zone during one training session. Even the pros don\u2019t spend more time in zone 5. Since you are probably not a pro, it is not a shame you can\u2019t finish this workout. This particular workout comes in many shapes and sizes. First of all, if I program a workout like this for an athlete I work with, it would be the final workout in a series for a high-level athlete prior to his race. So unless you are racing in a couple of weeks and competing at a high level, there is no need to do such an extreme version of this workout. If you want to complete this workout you have a few options. You could do multiple sets. So, breaking this workout up into two or three sets with a 5 to 6 minute rest will help. You could also lower the duration to 1-minute high intensity, with a 1-minute rest. Since that would double or even triple the reps, dividing them into three sets makes sense. The better option is to lower the tut (time under tension) and work with this workout for four to six weeks. Start with three or four reps and work to this workout version. Again, in my opinion, this is a max-effort workout, a workout with a certain time and place in a schedule. Have lots of fun, Coach Robert\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nThis is a custom coach jack workout so he specifically chose this series because he wanted something hard It\u2019s obvious he likes suffering, might be a Dr Seiler believer\u2026 who suggests this type of work. It\u2019s just that the recovery intervals are slightly too short so this amount suffering is digging a bit too deep, or possibly not possible depending on his W\u2019. I am not sure below is exactly what he has but depending on his FTP and W\u2019 you can see this is doable but for sure very hard. Most people don\u2019t want to dig this deep. See example with 250w + 12kj, should be very hard but possible image1972\u00d71074 175 KB See example with 250w + 8kj.",

Have a look: This is the workout as it is in the database here Screenshot 2024-01-29 090718927\u00d7775 52.9 KB This is the workout, as I had to perform it Screenshot 2024-01-29 090921914\u00d7481 49.9 KB As you can see, there is no ramp but only a constant beginning, and if you look very closely you can see that the times for each interval don\u2019t match either, i.e. the definition for the more intense parts is 30 secs each (WO ending at 08:30). In the workout I did, it was 45 secs each. I thought, I might have chosen a wrong workout, so I did a search of the database, but there is only one with that name in the database (taking a total of 10:43). Additional Info, I just found out, after posting: When I plan the workout it is shown in the calendar correctly, however I have connected Intervals.icu and there it is shown as a distance based workout instead of a time based. It seems somehow, that even though, distance is not recorded it is somehow connected to the issue.",

Best t\n\nPost 13 by yokuha:\nAlex: Yes, I don\u2019t like this aspect of the way every one does eFTP, I keep wanting to build something different (I tried once and failed\u2026). What do you refer to with \u201ethe way\u201c? Is it the single-ride eFTP? This is not the actual eFTP prediction if I.icu, I am sure you know. There is a chart in the fitness chart that shows I.icu\u2018s analysis of the whole training history, including increases from max. efforts and decrease over time\u2026 It still is only reasonable if one has repeated max efforts as time goes by. (Similar discussion for, e.g., TP and Xert left out;-). Major issue with this is that it uses any relevant best effort, and for short ones that. Igor contain significant anaerobic contributions if you just do 5 min allout after warmup\u2026 etc. I.icu also has the FTP/CP/W\u2018 calculator on the power page, which is a better approach because it uses (clearly documented) approaches to calculate these numbers and you can even compare the different implemented formulas, incl. multi-point calculations\u2026 Personally, I still adjust (increase/decrease) my FTP for training purposes based on RPE and EF of intervals I do regularly (4 x4\u2019 120 % or 2 x 20\u201330\u2019 90 % are good measures for me), esp. during race season. This is avoiding further load from tests, as brought up by @Robert_UCL\n\nPost 14 by Alex:\nYes, I am pretty sure intervals is also based on max efforts so if you are doing base training only or zone 2 it will go down when in reality your actually two hour aerobic performance might even be improving and for most of us 2 hour aerobic performance is more important than our 20 minute test time. So what happens is people get attached to this FTP calculation and their training can be dictated by their eFTP\u2026 or they pick a training plan that improves this estimate. For some riders this can be ok, but for many they would be better off just ignoring FTP all together other than a rough estimate of training intensities. I am just making up this theory now, but I would say eFTP or FTP improvements are most critical during a peak period of training\u2026 I have not thought that well through but it sounds right\n\nPost 15 by yokuha:\nAlex: I am pretty sure intervals is also based on max efforts Well, kind of \u2013 sure. As mentioned, you can choose different models for CP/FTP calculation on the Power page of i.icu. For instance, you could choose Morton\u2019s 3-parameter model: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139608964484\n\nPost 16 by Alex:\nSure I use W\u2019 CP calculations a lot but you still need max efforts and if you don\u2019t do max efforts in longer durations it can cause issues that increases in short durations can actually lower your estimated critical power \u201cFTP.\u201d",
