## Introduction

At TrainerDay, our approach to workout creation is centered around efficiency and user-friendliness, with a particular focus on speed. We understand that when it comes to workout planning, the less time you spend clicking around, the more time you have for actual training. Our workout editor is designed with this principle in mind, boasting an Excel-like speed focus that makes workout creation a breeze. "Designed for one thing. Speed." is not just a statement; it's the very foundation of how we've built our tools to serve athletes and coaches alike.

## The Fastest Workout Editor

"Designed for one thing. Speed." This motto encapsulates the essence of the TrainerDay workout editor. Built to function similarly to Excel, our editor supports keyboard shortcuts, copy/paste features, and arrow keys for navigation, ensuring a seamless and rapid workout creation experience. This Excel-like functionality is not just about familiarity; it's about making the process as efficient as possible. For instance, copying and pasting entire blocks of intervals or quickly moving through fields with arrow keys significantly reduces the time it takes to create or adjust workouts.

The inclusion of a 30-second video on our blog provides a clear demonstration of how swiftly one can operate within the editor, emphasizing the speed and ease of use that we promise. The ability to automatically switch from Slope to ERG or HR modes, as shown in another video, further exemplifies the editor's versatility and efficiency.

## Sets and Reps Editor

Using the example of a particularly long workout showcased in our blog, the Sets and Reps Editor stands out by simplifying the creation and management of complex interval structures. "This is a hard workout... It’s also a very long list of intervals." This comparison between our standard editor and the new Sets and Reps editor visually demonstrates the significant reduction in complexity and scrolling required to manage such workouts. The Sets and Reps editor, with its compact and concise format, not only saves time but also makes it easier to visualize the entire workout structure at a glance.

## Interval Comments

Currently, our support for interval comments is available for ZWO file downloads for Zwift only, but we have plans to expand this feature to more platforms. "Available for ZWO file downloads for Zwift only. More systems are coming soon." This feature is about enhancing the training experience with entertainment, education, and motivation through personalized interval comments. The promise of future support for other platforms and the straightforward method for deleting comments highlight our commitment to evolving and improving user experience.

## Training Modes

Our platform supports a variety of training modes: ERG, Slope, Resistance, and HR modes, each serving different training needs. ERG mode is highlighted as the main workhorse, ideal for hitting specific power targets without much thought. Slope mode, on the other hand, allows for a more manual control, simulating sustained slopes. Resistance mode offers a different kind of manual control, specifying resistance levels instead of slope angles. And finally, HR mode adjusts power targets based on the user's heart rate, ensuring they stay within their desired HR zone. "You can see in this video you can design workouts that automatically switches in and out of any of these modes," showcasing the flexibility our platform offers to cater to varied training preferences.

## Workout Cloning and Management

While the original content didn't specifically mention the Alt/Option drag feature for cloning, it's an essential part of managing and customizing workouts within TrainerDay. This feature, along with our comprehensive workout library management system, reflects our commitment to providing tools that are not only powerful but also easy to use, based on direct user feedback.

## Advanced Features: W'bal

W'bal, or Work Balance, is a sophisticated feature that helps users design the perfect interval workouts by understanding the balance between aerobic and anaerobic energy systems. "Basically, no one can do 60-minutes at FTP... W’Bal shows that it is 'easy.'" This paradox highlights the importance of not relying solely on FTP for workout intensity, especially for intervals above the aerobic threshold. W'bal serves as a guide to what's theoretically possible, emphasizing its utility for designing challenging yet achievable workouts.

## Common Issues and Solutions

Users have reported issues such as greyed-out control modes, which typically indicate a connection problem between the app and the smart trainer. Solutions to these and other common issues are openly discussed in our forums, reflecting our transparency and dedication to improving user experience. While we strive for perfection, we're honest about the limitations and actively work towards resolving them.

## Best Practices

To get the most out of the TrainerDay workout editor, here are some key tips: Familiarize yourself with keyboard shortcuts for efficiency, use the Sets and Reps editor for complex interval structures, and take advantage of interval comments for an enhanced training experience. Following these workflow recommendations ensures a smooth, efficient, and enjoyable workout creation process, maximizing the time spent training rather than planning.

By integrating these features and adhering to best practices, TrainerDay continues to offer an innovative platform that streamlines workout creation, allowing athletes and coaches to focus more on training and less on the intricacies of planning.
