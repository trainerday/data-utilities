# Advanced Features

Hey there, fellow TrainerDay enthusiast! If you've been diving into your workouts and looking for ways to tweak, enhance, and downright personalize your training experience, you're about to hit the jackpot with some of TrainerDay's advanced features. So, buckle up, because we're about to deep dive into how these features can rev your training sessions up a notch (or ten).

### Interval Comments: Your Training Whisperer

First things first, let's talk about interval comments. These little nuggets of text are like having a coach whispering in your ear exactly when you need it. Whether you're cranking up your cadence, heading outdoors for a workout, or navigating through complex progressions, interval comments have got your back. They pop up at the beginning of each interval, giving you that timely nudge or piece of advice to keep you on track. And for all you Zwifters out there, yes, these comments are also available for ZWO file downloads. Adding them is a breeze during the workout creation process in the workout editor. Just remember, getting the offset values right is crucial; otherwise, your comments might play hide and seek (and not in a fun way).

### Tag, You're It: Organize Like a Pro

Now onto the organizational wizardry that is tags. We believe in keeping things tidy and accessible, which is why we've introduced two types of tags: private and public. Private tags are your personal library organizer, keeping your workouts neatly categorized in a way that makes sense to you. Public tags, on the other hand, let the TrainerDay community discover your public workouts more easily. Alongside lists, plans, and the calendar, tags are your best friend in managing your workout library. Whether you want to earmark your favorites or cluster workouts into custom lists, tags make it all a cinch.

### The Broadcast Feature: Big Screen, Big Gains

Ever thought your workout data would look good on the big screen? Well, with TrainerDay's broadcast feature, that thought becomes reality. This nifty feature beams your workout data in real-time to any web browser, allowing you to see all the critical info on a larger display. It's perfect for those structured workouts where keeping an eye on your power zones, heart rate, or cadence is key. Whether you're using a PC, Mac, or even screen mirroring to your TV via Apple TV or similar devices, setting up is straightforward. Just make sure you have a stable WiFi connection, and you're good to go. This feature not only enhances your training environment but can be customized to show just the data, data with YouTube videos, or whatever else keeps you motivated.

### The 6-Second Warmup: No Time Wasted

In the world of indoor training, every second counts, especially when you're squeezing workouts into a busy schedule. That's where our 6-second warmup feature comes into play. Designed to eliminate dead time between opening the app and starting to pedal, it ensures you're warming up from the get-go. But remember, it's not meant to replace a proper warmup for those intense sessions. Think of it more as a quick-start feature that gets you moving while you decide on the day's workout.

### In Conclusion

Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting, TrainerDay's advanced features are designed to enhance your training experience in a practical, user-friendly way. We've covered interval comments for that personalized coaching touch, tags for supreme organization, the broadcast feature for an immersive training setup, and the quick-start convenience of the 6-second warmup. Each of these features is a tool in your training arsenal, ready to be utilized in a way that suits your unique needs and preferences. So, go ahead, make your workouts harder, smarter, or more organized; with TrainerDay, you surely can.
