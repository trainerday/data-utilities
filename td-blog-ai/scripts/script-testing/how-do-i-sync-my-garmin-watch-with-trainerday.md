title: How do I sync my Garmin watch with TrainerDay?
---

Getting your Garmin watch synced with TrainerDay involves a few different approaches depending on what you're trying to accomplish. Let me walk you through the main ways this works based on what I've seen users do successfully.

## Connecting Your Garmin Account

The first step is linking your Garmin Connect account to TrainerDay. Head to My Profile, then Apps and Devices, and connect to Garmin. This is your foundation for most of the sync functionality between the platforms.

## Pushing Workouts to Your Garmin Device

Once you're connected, you can send TrainerDay workouts directly to your Garmin calendar. There are two main ways to do this:

**Send Individual Workouts**: Go to any workout and click "Send To > Garmin." You'll see a popup that lets you push that specific workout. This requires a paid TrainerDay membership, but the advantage is that workouts sent directly to your Garmin calendar give you better integration with your device.

**Calendar Sync**: If you're using TrainerDay's calendar feature, you can turn on calendar sync. This automatically pushes changes from your TrainerDay calendar to Garmin Connect as you make them. When you add a workout to a list like your Favorites or schedule it on your calendar, it syncs over to Garmin.

## Using Your Heart Rate Data

For heart rate monitoring during TrainerDay workouts, your Garmin watch can broadcast HR data to the app. Look for the "Broadcast HR" function on your watch - this lets TrainerDay read your heart rate data during indoor training sessions. The TrainerDay app should recognize and connect to your Garmin watch when you set up this broadcast mode.

## What About Completed Workouts?

Here's where things get a bit more complex. TrainerDay can't automatically sync completed workout data back to Garmin Connect - Garmin doesn't allow third-party apps to do this directly. Several users have asked about this, and I've seen people work around it in a few ways:

Some users save their TrainerDay workout files and manually upload them through the Garmin Connect website. Others use services like RunGap to bridge the gap between TrainerDay and Garmin Connect for completed activities.

If you're doing outdoor workouts that you've sent from TrainerDay to your Garmin calendar, those will naturally save to Garmin Connect when you complete them on your bike computer or watch.

## Using TrainingPeaks as a Bridge

One approach that works well is connecting both TrainerDay and your Garmin devices to a free TrainingPeaks account. TrainerDay can push workouts to TrainingPeaks, and many Garmin devices can sync with TrainingPeaks as well. This gives you another pathway to get your TrainerDay workouts onto your Garmin device.

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

If your Garmin watch connects to TrainerDay but isn't reading heart rate data, double-check that you've enabled the broadcast function on your watch. The app might recognize your device but still need that specific setting activated to pull HR data during workouts.

For calendar sync issues, I've seen cases where the wrong workouts get sent to Garmin. This usually happens when there's a mismatch between what's scheduled in your TrainerDay calendar and what actually gets pushed over. If this occurs, check that your calendar sync settings are configured correctly and that you're sending the right plan to your calendar first.

## The Bottom Line

Garmin sync with TrainerDay works best for getting workouts onto your device rather than getting completed workout data back to Garmin Connect. The integration handles the "send workouts to Garmin" direction smoothly, especially with a paid membership. For the reverse direction - getting TrainerDay workout results into Garmin Connect - you'll likely need a manual process or a third-party sync service.

The key is setting up that initial connection in Apps and Devices, then choosing whether you want to send individual workouts or use the calendar sync feature based on how you like to plan your training.
