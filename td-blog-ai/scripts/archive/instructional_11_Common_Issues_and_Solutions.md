# Common Issues and Solutions

## Intervals.icu Integration Issues

### Missing Interval Markers
When uploading completed workouts to intervals.icu:
1. Export the .fit file from TrainerDay
2. Upload to intervals.icu
3. If intervals don't appear, check that:
   - The workout was completed in full
   - The .fit file was exported correctly
   - Your intervals.icu account is properly connected

### Calendar Sync Discrepancies
Some workouts may appear differently between TrainerDay calendar and intervals.icu. This is typically due to:
- Rounding differences in interval durations
- Different handling of transition periods
- Varying interpretations of workout intensity

## Workout Design Issues

### Ramp vs Steps Conversion
TrainingPeaks and Garmin do not support ramps. When exporting to these platforms:
- TrainerDay automatically converts ramps to steps
- The conversion maintains the intended training stimulus
- Review the converted workout before executing

### Inserting/Deleting Rows
To modify workout steps:
1. Navigate to the workout editor
2. Select the row where you want to make changes
3. Use the provided controls to insert or delete rows
4. Save your changes

## Training Mode Considerations

### ERG Mode Limitations
ERG mode is optimal for specific power targets but may not be suitable for:
- Variable terrain simulation
- Free riding
- Some types of sprint workouts

Consider using other modes when:
- Doing technique work
- Practicing real-world scenarios
- Working on pedaling dynamics

## Heart Rate Training

### Zone Calculation
For heart rate-based training:
- Typical aerobic threshold (AeT) falls between 65-70% of max HR
- Some athletes may have higher thresholds
- When in doubt, use the lower end of the range
- Consider using external tools like FatMaxxer for more precise measurements
