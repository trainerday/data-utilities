# Tips and Best Practices

Hey there, fellow TrainerDay enthusiast! Let’s dive into some tips and best practices that can really elevate your training experience. Whether you’re a cycling newbie or a seasoned pro, these insights are designed to help you get the most out of TrainerDay. So, grab your favorite beverage, get comfy, and let's talk training.

### Tagging: Your Organizational BFF

If you're anything like me, you love a bit of order in your life. That's where tagging in TrainerDay comes into play. We've got two types of tags: private and public. Private tags are your personal secret sauce for organizing workouts just the way you like. Public tags, on the other hand, are visible to everyone when you make a workout public. This is super handy for when you want to share your killer workout with the community. Remember, only the creator of the workout can add these tags, so make them count!

Use tags alongside other organizational tools like lists, plans, and the calendar for the ultimate in workout organization. Tagging is like putting a big, shiny bow on your workout library. It’s all about making your life easier.

### Multi-Sport: Not Just for Cyclists Anymore

2022/2023 is the year TrainerDay became a multi-sport superstar. We've added Vasa SwimErg and RowErg into the mix. This means you can create and search for swim and row workouts too. Talk about leveling up! If you're into triathlons or just enjoy mixing up your training, make sure to enable these features in your profile settings. It's a game-changer for those of us who don't just stick to one sport.

### Cadence, Sprints, and Progression - Oh My!

We've been busy bees over here, adding new features to Coach Jack. Cadence targets on some Z2 efforts and micro sprints on some Z2 efforts are just the beginning. All progression workouts have been improved with a bit more intensity to give you that extra challenge. But remember, if you want to make it harder, you surely can. We believe in pushing limits, but also in listening to your body.

### Heart Rate Monitors and ERG Mode

For those who love data, pairing TrainerDay with a heart rate monitor or getting into ERG mode can really up your game. Heart rate suggestions can help tailor your workouts even more closely to your fitness level. And if you're an ERG mode enthusiast, but open to learning how slope mode works, you're in for a treat. It's all about finding what works best for you and your training goals.

### Technical Glitches? We've Got Your Back

Let's face it, technology can be a bit finicky at times. If you've ever had interval times off by a few seconds or experienced a power reading that's too high, don't fret. These issues can usually be resolved with a bit of troubleshooting. Our community forums are a great resource for solving these pesky problems. Chances are, someone else has encountered the same issue and found a solution.

### Incorporating External Workouts

Got a killer workout from another platform you're dying to try? No problem. TrainerDay lets you load external workouts, making it a breeze to mix things up. Whether it's a ZWO file from Zwift or something else, we've made sure you have the flexibility to train your way.

### A Simple Plan: The Four Pillars of Performance

Feeling overwhelmed with where to start? Our "Simple Cycling Training Plan" video breaks it down into four easy-to-understand pillars of performance. Starting with easy intervals and building to harder intervals is a proven strategy. And don't forget, sometimes lower intensity weeks can outperform higher intensity weeks. It's all about balance and listening to what your body needs.

### The Bottom Line

At TrainerDay, we believe in flexibility, personalization, and most importantly, enjoying the journey. Whether you're tagging workouts for supreme organization, diving into multi-sport training, or fine-tuning your sessions with cadence and sprints, there's something here for everyone. Remember, training is as much about listening to your body as it is about pushing its limits. So, use these tips and best practices to craft a training experience that’s uniquely yours. Happy training!
