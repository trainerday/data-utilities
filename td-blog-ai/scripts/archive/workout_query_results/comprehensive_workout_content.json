        "text": "Blog Article: The Benefits Of A Polarized Approach To Cycling Training\n\nEndurance sports demand discipline, dedication, and a well-structured training regimen to achieve optimal performance. Over the years, various training methodologies have been employed to help cyclists reach their full potential. One of the more effective and promising approaches to cycling training is the polarized training method. This method emphasizes the extreme ends of intensity: low-intensity, steady-state rides and high-intensity, interval-based workouts. In this article, we will explore why taking a more polarized approach to cycling training is beneficial.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-18rRLiSGI6ZCtsrMBi-ZIAA.jpg)\n\n**Improved Aerobic Base**\n\nThe foundation of any successful cyclist is a robust aerobic capacity. Low-intensity, steady-state rides are essential for building and maintaining this foundation. A polarized training approach allocates a significant portion of training time to these steady-state rides, allowing cyclists to develop a solid aerobic base. This base enhances the body\u2019s ability to transport and utilize oxygen, which is crucial for prolonged efforts in endurance cycling events.\n\n**Enhanced Recovery**\n\nOne of the main benefits of a polarized approach is that it includes low-intensity workouts that promote active recovery. After intense training sessions or competitions, it\u2019s vital for cyclists to recover effectively to avoid overtraining and injury. Low-intensity rides allow athletes to flush out metabolic waste products, reduce muscle soreness, and maintain active recovery, ensuring they are ready for high-intensity workouts when needed.\n\n**Greater Fat Utilization**\n\nThese low intensity efforts offer to improve a cyclist\u2019s ability to utilize fat as a fuel source. This is a valuable skill, especially in long-distance events, where carbohydrate stores can become depleted. By increasing fat utilization, cyclists can conserve glycogen stores for later in the race, improving their overall endurance.\n\n**Time-Efficient Training**\n\nCyclists often face time constraints due to work, family, and other commitments. By focusing on two distinct intensity zones, cyclists can achieve more efficient improvements. This time efficiency can make it easier for athletes to balance training with other responsibilities.\n\n**Mental Toughness**\n\nCycling is as much a mental game as it is a physical one. High-intensity intervals push cyclists to their limits and demand mental resilience. If you love hard intervals then sure jump right in, but we believe a slow build up to these longer sessions of hard intervals will produce great results and are a smarter, safer way to train.\n\nIf you want to race or beat your friends on fast group rides then the ability to embrace discomfort and continue pushing through the pain is essential for success. A polarized approach forces cyclists to confront these challenges regularly, helping them develop mental toughness that can be applied to races and other aspects of life.\n\n**Long-Term Sustainability**\n\nThe polarized approach promotes long-term sustainability in cycling training. By balancing low and high-intensity sessions, it reduces the risk of burnout, overtraining, and injuries. This sustainability allows athletes to maintain a consistent training regimen over months and years, steadily improving their performance and achieving their long-term cycling goals.\n\n**Performance Gains**\n\nUltimately, the primary goal of any training approach is improved performance. The polarized method, by developing a robust aerobic base, enhancing fat utilization, and building mental toughness, leads to significant performance gains. Cyclists who adopt this approach often find that they can achieve higher speeds, maintain their power output for longer durations, and consistently reach peak form when it matters most.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe polarized approach to cycling training is not a one-size-fits-all solution, but for many cyclists, it offers a highly effective and efficient way to achieve their goals. By balancing low-intensity, steady-state rides with higher-intensity intervals, this approach promotes an enhanced aerobic base, improved recovery, and long-term sustainability. The mental and physical benefits of a polarized approach can lead to significant performance gains that can propel cyclists to success in their chosen discipline. As with any training method, it is essential to tailor it to individual needs and goals, but for those seeking a proven and balanced approach, polarized training is undoubtedly worth considering.\n\nThe Coach Jack Plan builder in TrainerDay is not exactly the same as traditional polarized training but embraces a process of starting easy and slowly working towards much harder workouts all while maintaining a mostly easy approach to training. Just like Dr Seiler suggests, your average season with coach Jack will likely be closer to 90/10 for time in zone if you take his base recommendations. If you want to make it harder you surely can.",

        "text": "Blog Article: Everything You Need to Know About Training in 15 Minutes: Dylan Johnson (CTS)\n\nWe are starting a series on evidence-based training. The primary goal is to inspire you to take full control of your training and be more confident in your choices and recognize when you are going off the path. Following a generic training plan will rarely make you as fast as if you self-coach and make quality adjustments along the way. These adjustments are critical to top health, which plays a big part in your performance.\n\nVideo Review: CTS is arguably one of the most respected coaching organizations in the world. In this video, Dylan represents the CTS and backs up his claims with evidence. He uses references from the extremely well-respected sports scientist Stephen Seiler from Norway. I am not so sure it is everything you need to know in 15-minutes, especially I think he could limit the discussion on weight training. His other videos fill in many of the gaps he left out of this.\n\nOne interesting thing is, just like virtually all pro-level coaches, Dylan\u2019s suggestions are simple. Basic periodization, a few simple workouts that progressively get harder and a shift to more weight training in the off season. What we call a peak period, he calls a build period, that targets your specific goals.\n\n[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nqHn3vAWpI)\n\n**Some of Dylan\u2019s claims below**\n\nMany of them backed up with evidence\n\nBelow, we have captured some good points Dylan makes in this video. Take these and start to build your own library of knowledge on how to self-coach and take your performance to the next level. It takes a little time, but your performance will benefit. Invest in your future!!!\n\n1.  Periodization means that your training is changing over time, which is what we want\n2.  When planning out a season it\u2019s important that your workouts become more specific to your goal event as you get closer to that event\n3.  Short-term periods of high-intensity interval training can elicit improvements but also that important adaptations appear to occur with low intensity continuous training that are not observed with mixed or high-intensity training when training does not have an appropriate blend of both high-intensity training and high-volume training inserted into the program performance ability can stagnate\n4.  The timeline for all of this higher intensity could be four to seven months before you want to be in peak shape\n5.  With few exceptions having just two or on occasion three high-intensity days per week is what you\u2019re shooting for and you want to do these days when you\u2019re well-rested so they can be as high quality as possible\n6.  Don\u2019t forget to throw in a rest week every three to four weeks to rid your\n7.  Body of the fatigue you\u2019ve built up during a rest week you\u2019re still riding but at about forty to sixty percent of your normal volume\n8.  The optimal tapering strategy was one that reduced volume without any modifications in intensity or frequency\n9.  One of the most important things you can do to improve your cycling performance is to not train at selective points in the year hear me out taking a break is extremely important to progress and often times athletes will find that they get their best results after a period of forced rest the offseason and mid-season break are commonplace amongst pro cyclist for one simple reason it works\n10.  The research really couldn\u2019t be more clear lifting will make you a faster cyclist\n11.  You want to start lifting in the offseason when your training load is low and reduce or stop doing it as training volume gets high\n\nI will continue to add more of Dylan\u2019s suggestions here, but my key point is to **start with highly reputable coaches and coaching organizations that use evidence to support their suggestions.** This will reduce confusion and I believe you will find you see a lot more consensus across the different programs. Dylan has a lot of videos. Take notes on them (we will continue to do this). If you take his suggestions and build a cheat-sheet, you will start having solid principals to being your own coach.\n\n**Europe vs America**\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0xgaoVk6vxqund0VU.jpg)\n\nI am friends with one of the top European coaches. What I see is his big picture principals are similar to Dylan\u2019s.",

        "text": "Blog Article: Indoor Cycling 101 Three Types Virtual Outdoor Structured Training Spin Classes\n\nYou may not have thought about it before, but there are a few different versions of \u2018indoor cycling.\u2019 While they all involve pedaling a stationary bike, there are many different ways that they connect to apps, use structured workouts, and hold some values over others. This article is a quick guide to the three types of indoor cycling.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1dHHYgDpVndRUPRt4jtdXwg.png)\n\n**Virtual outdoor cycling\u200a\u2014**\u200aThese are apps such as FulGaz or Rouvy that pair real-life ride footage with your indoor trainer. Instead of a virtual world like Watopia in Zwift, you will be virtually riding real-life roads in Italy, France, or California. In order to get this footage, these apps put cameras on the bikes of riders who complete these routes IRL, and then upload the footage to the app.\n\nWhile virtual cycling may be a bit clunkier than pure virtual training apps, they are certainly the most realistic and transformative, creating a virtual reality cycling experience like no other. You can even complete workouts and races on some of these apps, and compete against other virtual avatars on real-life roads.\n\n**Structured Training\u2014** Forget all the fancy visuals and stimulating gimmicks, these apps are all about structured interval training. TrainerRoad is the most popular example of this style of app, which prioritizes dedicated training rather than group rides, social connection, or racing. TrainerDay is a similar app to TrainerRoad with a few different features and a much lower price.\n\nThese apps, such as TrainerDay, include hundreds\u200a\u2014\u200aand sometimes thousands\u200a\u2014\u200aof structured workouts designed to make you faster. Some apps will help create a custom training plan designed to fit you and your cycling goals, while others will be more of a free-for-all and let you pick whatever workout you want. In the app, there isn\u2019t much to look at other than your power and heart rate graph. Some apps, like Wahoo SYSTM, including videos of real-life racing to help keep you entertained, but nothing that matches up with your effort like a virtual avatar in Zwift. TrainerRoad is even simpler, with only numbers to look at, it takes a dedicated and focused cyclist to get through these workouts.\n\n**Zwift\u200a\u2014**\u200aThe world\u2019s most popular indoor cycling app, Zwift, is a blend between virtual outdoor cycling and power interval training. You could even argue that it is a \u2018virtual indoor cycling app\u2019 because many of its routes and worlds are imaginary. In fact, the original Zwift world of Watopia is completely made up. Though Zwift does include many real-life routes such as NYC, Innsbruck, Yorkshire, and Richmond, it does mix in a plethora of virtual routes as well.\n\nThere are also thousands of workouts to choose from on Zwift\u200a\u2014\u200athere are literally overall 2000 workouts on the app\u200a\u2014\u200awhich means that you can get all of your structured training done too. However, you\u2019ll need to ride one of Zwift\u2019s routes during the workout, which can be overstimulating compared to the distraction-free backdrops of TrainerDay.\u00a0  \nSpin bike classes\n\nThe most popular name in this space is Peloton, which has a dedicated following and a user base in the millions. Spin bike classes are more like following a workout video than they are virtual cycling. There are no virtual worlds, no virtual bikes or avatars, and many times, there isn\u2019t even a power measurement or display. Instead, these apps tell you how hard you\u2019re working based on heart rate, resistance level, and cadence.\n\nPeloton and other spin bike classes include real-life footage of real spin class instructors to guide you through a spin bike workout. These bikes are not smart trainers; in fact, they are exclusively indoor bikes. The spin classes are entertaining and engaging, with high-energy instructors and fitting background music. These classes are designed more for recreational cyclists and fitness enthusiasts than for dedicated cyclists. Nevertheless, spin bike classes have their place in the indoor cycling world, as you\u2019d be hard-pressed to have as much fun while completing a lung-busting workout.\n\nWritten by Zach Nehr",

Higher Intensity\n\n4.  Zone 2\u200a\u2014\u200aLow Intensity\n\n6.  Polarized or mostly easy with some intensity\n\n8.  Classic Periodization\n\n10.  Chase the squirrels\u200a\u2014\u200aHow many people ride in Zwift\n\nSo there is a lot that can be said about each of these choices.\n\n**Let\u2019s start with, any of them might be the best choice for you!!!**\n\nIf you have any risk of losing motivation and stopping training during the winter that by far the most important one is the one that brings you the most enjoyment, and having fun should always be a top priority.\n\nAny of these choices can be done in any training app but option #2, #3, and #5 stand out for TrainerDay and our training app being one of the best choices. Any of these choices can be static training, meaning do it as planned no matter what. Any of them can also be made a more dynamic style of training, meaning change your training during the workout. We are strong believers in dynamic training and training by feel.\n\n**ERG mode should be a convenience not a contract!**\n\nOur app works extremely well with the dynamic model of training because you can go quickly from HR mode to ERG mode to slope mode within a workout as well as very quickly raise the intensity and even merge different workouts together on the fly.\n\n**I am not answering the question. Which is best?**\n\n**Regarding #1\u200a\u2014\u200aHigh intensity indoor training.** \u201ci.e. TrainerRoad style.\u201d You can design hard plans in Coach Jack or pick from our community workouts and plans but is this the best choice? Many riders understandably want to do a reverse periodization style of training, meaning high intensity interval training indoors in the winter and just have fun outdoors and not do structured training. This sounds perfect but it does have some draw backs.\n\nMany people ride fairly hard outdoors so that can mean that you end up with a December to June or longer doing higher intensity training, this includes your more focused high intensity at the beginning, which is the reverse of normal endurance training (i.e. reverse periodization).\n\nThe downside risk is that anyone riding like this is at high risk of burnout, over training or at least lowered motivation by the time they get to May/June. I was talking to pro coach Andrea Morelli (the designer of Coach Jack plans). Andrea, does not feel reverse periodization working very well from a top performance perspective and you would need to really do it right it to make it work for you.\n\nOne addition to to a high intensity winter could include doing a small base period in early March to let your body recover, but that\u2019s not easy for most people. Beautiful weather starting and you need to do focus on going really slow outdoors, good luck with that, strong dedication. Anyway it can be done, but just training hard in the winter and hoping for the best in late spring is not likely effective.\n\n**Option #2\u200a\u2014\u200ai.e. pure base\u200a\u2014**\u200acan be very effective but you need to fully buy into the idea, it\u2019s a mental struggle if you don\u2019t believe in it. Watch some Zone 2 GCN videos or google Inigo San Milan and see what he is suggesting. It has been shown this can be very effective on as little as 6 hours a week, but this is much longer discussion. One great benefit is you can be super hungry and excited when outdoor season starts and another is that indoor you can just watch Netflix and pedal easy\u00a0:)\n\nNumber #3 and #4 overlap but this is very classic style and how most pros train. They don\u2019t exactly follow the 80/20 principal of polarized training but they do include a a lot of easy in their training, getting progressively harder towards race season.\n\nCoach Jack creates great plans that fit traditional periodization and you could just do base, build and peak periods. Indoors it could be more structured and outdoors can move to more dynamic training by feel just focusing mostly on volume and trying to control the urge and moderate your intensity so your outdoor season starts a bit easier and moves to higher intensity as your season progresses.",

        "text": "Blog Article: Indoor Cycling Trainers Smart Vs Non Smart\n\nEverything you need to know about Smart vs Non-Smart Indoor Trainers  \nWhen it comes to choosing an indoor trainer, there are N+1 options to choose from, built by tens of different manufacturers, and all within a massive price range of $200\u20131500. But how big is the difference between a $200 trainer and a $1500 trainer?\n\n![Smart Trainer vs Dumb Trainer](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1gr4fQIRxl03MBD6OZ7s9WA.png)\n\nOne of the biggest differentiating factors between indoor trainers is smart capability. \u201cSmart\u201d trainers are indoor cycling trainers that attach to your bike and have the capabilities of being controlled by an app, such as Zwift. These trainers measure power, and sometimes cadence as well, using internal sensors, so you don\u2019t necessarily need additional power meters or cadence sensors on your bike.\n\nSmart trainers adjust the gradient to match an indoor cycling harder or easier in accordance with the virtual gradient. A smart trainer will make a +7% grade feel very hard, and a -3% grade feel fairly easy, for example. You can also adjust the degree of trainer resistance, or even turn it off. 100% trainer difficulty means that the trainer\u2019s resistance will match the virtual gradient, making a +7% gradient feel like a +7% gradient (so you\u2019re going to need the little ring).\n\nUsers can adjust the trainer difficulty at any time, so you can play with the settings to see which is best for you. Most riders use a smart trainer difficulty setting of 20\u201350%, as this allows you to climb more virtual hills and tackle 12% gradients without pedaling too hard or running out of gears. For the complete IRL riding experience, some riders use 100% trainer difficulty which feels just like riding outside.\n\nYou can also use ERG mode on smart trainers, which is a workout mode where the trainer will automatically adjust its resistance to fit a desired power output. Within a given workout, when the interval says to ride at 200w, the smart trainer will automatically adjust its resistance to 200w, and all you need to do is pedal. The trainer will make minor adjustments to keep your cadence around 85\u201390rpm, which means that it doesn\u2019t really matter which gear you\u2019re in during an ERG mode interval. This is great for structured workouts, such as the ones that we have here on TrainerDay.\n\nSmart trainers are significantly more expensive than non-smart (i.e. dumb) trainers, which don\u2019t have the internal electronic capabilities, nor an internal power meter. The cheapest smart trainers you can find are wheel-on smart trainers, which start around $300. For a direct drive smart trainer (which takes the place of your bike\u2019s rear wheel and attaches directly to the rear dropouts), the cheapest versions start at $650, with the high-end models such as the Tacx NEO 2T costing $1400.\n\nFor a much more affordable option, you can buy a non-smart, or dumb, trainer for less than $250. A dumb trainer is an indoor trainer which attaches your bike to an adjustable resistance drum, but one that cannot connect to external apps. This rear drum is what creates the resistance for your rear wheel, and it is how you adjust the resistance during your ride. However, you won\u2019t typically be able to adjust the resistance during your ride; rather, you\u2019ll set the resistance at the beginning of your ride when you tighten the drum onto your rear tire.\n\nThus, in order to make your ride harder or easier\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as during a set of intervals\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can shift gears, just as you would on a flat road outside.\u00a0  \nDumb trainers are significantly cheaper than smart trainers, but they are much less capable. These indoor trainers don\u2019t measure power on their own, and you\u2019ll have to focus on your own effort to hit target wattages, or simulate riding up or down hills.\n\nYou can connect to external apps while riding a dumb trainer, but it won\u2019t be the trainer itself that is doing the connecting. Instead, you will need an external power meter (pedals, crank arm, or bottom bracket), a speed sensor, or a cadence sensor.",

In this post, we\u2019ll go through all the other types of indoor trainers, tell you the benefits and drawbacks of each, and how to choose between one and the other.\n\n![Tax Neo\u200a\u2014\u200aDirect Drive Trainer](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0rv3RTf1m3B2zZ-3q.jpg)\n\n**Smart Bikes\u200a\u2014**\u200aA smart bike is a purpose-built indoor bike only meant for indoor riding. These contraptions are smooth and silent, and usually cost $2500\u20133500. A smart bike looks a bit like a future bicycle without wheels. Some versions look a bit like spin bikes (more on those below), with a heavier front flywheel rather than a rear flywheel.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0fNl2PsD2m9Z-5h1y.jpg)\n\nSome smart bikes can tilt up or down, to simulate riding up climbs or down descents, just like the Wahoo KICKR Climb or Elite Rizer. Smart bikes are virtually silent, super smooth, and ultra-comfortable. Instead of normal gearing with a derailleur, chain rings, and a cassette, a smart bike\u2019s shifting is all virtual, which means that when you click the shifter, the smart bike changes the resistance virtually, rather than physically shifting a mechanical gear. This makes shifting super smooth and quieter than ever. You can also adjust your gearing preferences to fit exactly what you like. It\u2019s an unparalleled experience. **For the ultimate indoor training machine, go with an indoor smart bike.**\n\n**Spin Bikes\u200a\u2014**\u200aSpin bikes are more basic versions of indoor smart bikes, but they are usually designed for the general population rather than experienced cyclists. Peloton bikes, for examples, feature wide and tall handlebars, with an upright riding position that is much more upright than the traditional road cycling position. This puts less strain on the arms and lower back, which is much better for beginner or recreational riders.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-06-h6ak11ygWKtUES.jpg)\n\nWhile spin bikes are significantly cheaper than indoor smart bikes, they are much less capable. Most spin bikes do not include a power meter, and you\u2019ll have to adjust the resistance manually, sometimes with a turn knob on the top tube.\n\nOverall, spin bikes are generally used for spin bike classes, or guided group workouts, rather than individual rides, workouts, or virtual races. Spin bike classes are instructor-led classes that typically involve pumping music, motivating leaders, and effort-based (rather than power-based) interval training. These classes are completely different from the feel and workout you would get on an app like Zwift or TrainerDay.\n\nThat said, some spin bikes can connect to third-party apps such as Zwift, but most spin bikes are dumb trainers, in the way that they cannot connect to third-party apps or measure power on their own. Peloton bikes, for example, fall into this category, so you won\u2019t be able to ride this bike on Zwift. For the higher-end spin bikes such as a Peloton, this is a big letdown because it really limits your training options on an expensive piece of indoor cycling equipment. A moderately priced Schwinn ic4 is an example of a spin bike that has a built in power meter although it should be noted that the accuracy is questionable on most spin bikes.\n\n**Rollers\u200a\u2014**\u200aRollers are the final type of indoor cycling equipment, and these are exactly as they sound. Balance your bike on top of the three spinning drums (i.e. rollers), and start pedaling. You\u2019ll have to practice, as riding on your bike on rollers comes with a steep learning curve. However, once you get the hang of it, roller-riding is a unique and engaging experience.\u00a0  \nWhen riding on rollers, it almost feels like you\u2019re riding on the open road.",

        "text": "Blog Article: FTP Measures Aerobic - What About Anaerobic?\n\n#### Need some extra\u00a0power?\n\nIn cycling, aerobic power, measured by FTP, is not optional, it\u2019s what gets you in the game. But if you want to excel in MTB, cyclo-cross, or find yourself periodically get dropped in sprints with your buddies, you might need to build your anaerobic power.\n\nFTP, i.e. Functional Threshold Power, has become the most common term in performance cycling. It is great to have a single term to represent your cycling fitness level. It\u2019s very useful that it allows **AEROBIC** training to be easily and even automatically adjusted to the right intensity.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0XOzrJ9RinsaYnqv8.png)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0RRh402_XqybSuGBV.png)\n\n### The other energy system\u200a\u2014\u200aAnaerobic\n\nA deeper understanding of your fitness requires looking at both your aerobic and anaerobic abilities. If you take a ramp test, for example, your anaerobic power might noticeably affect your test, throwing off your FTP a little.\n\nDiscussing and thinking about anaerobic capacity seems to be scary for many cyclists, not the anaerobic training itself, but measuring anaerobic seems to be the scary part.\n\nMeasuring your anaerobic can be as simple as measuring your FTP and provide valuable insight and give you motivation when your FTP has flatlined.\n\n### Burning Matches\n\nCyclists like to call it burning matches, you only have so many to burn before your energy level crashes. The number of matches you have is your Anaerobic Work Capacity (AWC or W\u2019) We will use the term W\u2019 (pronounced W-Prime).\n\nMonitoring your personal W\u2019 will give you insight to your Anaerobic Work Capacity. Weight lifting is anaerobic and both it and anaerobic cycling follow similar principals. Imagine going to the gym, lifting weights but not tracking or even measuring your progress. Just grab a random set of weights and lift them a random number of times. Similar to lifting weights, building your W\u2019 requires training close to or to failure. Doing the correct amount of exercise will provide more predictable results, allowing your body to repair and build itself. We could all use a few more matches.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0TOqNMHh15K4t9Q0D.png)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0bN-mxf7XLySPsZrM.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0bSajC43XgSgjMdbg.jpg)\n\n### Light bulbs and your Electricity bill\n\nWe have been comfortable using watts for lightbulbs and hair-dryers for a long time, and with the popularity of power meters we are comfortable using watts on our bikes. The watts measurement is instantaneous, it has no time. You can say \u201cwatts for 10-seconds\u201d but watts themselves have no time. So when talking about energy, we need to include time. This unit of measurement is kilojoules (kJ). A joule is 1-watt for 1-second. Kilojoules are on your electricity bill. You measure your W\u2019 in kilojoules. You likely have a W\u2019 between 5\u201340kJ. That is a fixed number of watts for a fixed amount of time.\n\n### W\u2019s amazing\u00a0cousin\n\nSo one of the incredible benefits of knowing your W\u2019 along with your FTP is with our new feature in our workout creator, you can find or design intervals that precisely fit your fitness profile.\n\nFor example, you are doing 2-minute VO2Max intervals. How long should the rests be? And should the intervals be at 120% or 125%? Welcome to W\u2019 Balance (W\u2019Bal) this is W\u2019s perfect cousin. Scientific studies have show that W\u2019Bal can accurately predict when you will hit failure. It\u2019s sounds scary, but it is surprisingly simple. We will explain how it works in part #3 of this series.\n\n!",

        "text": "Blog Article: Why Ftp Based Training Is Half Wrong\n\n### Sorry, but they sold you some bad\u00a0gas\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad, workouts designed around FTP are great for aerobic training. They are just poorly optimized for anaerobic workouts. It\u2019s funny for me to say that since we have a website with 5000+ FTP based workouts. Many or most of these workouts have at least one anaerobic interval.\n\nThe anaerobic workouts on the TrainerDay site do provide benefits but if you take your training seriously, you might want to stop using generic FTP based anaerobic workouts and move to something more individualized. We are offering a new feature to make this simple.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0WMKgtVgSB5QqRE8V.jpg)\n\nYes, there is a relationship between FTP and anerobic workouts, but not a strong enough relationship to consider it personalized like they aerobic brother. Because FTP does not individualize these workouts for you, most anaerobic workouts on almost all the platforms will either be too hard or too easy to maximize your potential and save you time.\n\nFor most cyclists aerobic training is 90% of the battle, so **FTP based aerobic training TRUELY IS the most important part.** Many of us can just stop reading now and keep doing our FTP based aerobic focused workouts and we will be fine. MTB, cyclocross and many other riders that rely on sprinting power better keep reading.\n\nOk, for those of you still here, the good news is, once you know your W\u2019 it only takes a few minutes in TrainerDay to customize anaerobic workouts to match your fitness profile. You can easily clean the water out of your gas.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0Wp8XKIfqHQH-nd0P.jpg)\n\n### Anaerobic training, intensities and durations.\n\nLet\u2019s state this another way. Trying to determine how much weight to lift at the gym based on FTP is not likely the best approach. That is an extreme case example, but I am just saying don\u2019t base your anaerobic training on an aerobic measurement. This is not me saying this, this is many years of science saying the relationship between the two is very loose.\n\nPros usually have both large aerobic and anaerobic abilities. For everyone else, the relationship between the two is not so clear. Great sprinters have large anaerobic ability and some cyclists have very little anaerobic capacity.\n\nSo why do we and everyone determine your anaerobic training intervals, based on your FTP? Because it is simple and in roughly in the ball-park.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0NIgIg17aIicTYK50.jpg)\n\n### To prove what is wrong, let\u2019s look at an\u00a0example\n\nYou can ignore below and just see the charts on the right\n\n**We have two riders**  \na) Rider-A with a 200-watt FTP  \nb) Rider-B with a 300-watt FTP\n\nBoth riders have the same anaerobic work capacity, their W\u2019 = 20kJ. These riders with the same W\u2019 but a different FTP should not be doing the same anaerobic workouts **based on percent of FTP.**\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0VIhh0NIJTULKh2GA.jpg)\n\nLet me prove that with a slight amount of MATH (I know that is a 4-letter word). This is all based on established science. W\u2019 is a fixed amount of energy that you have above your FTP. You can do a fixed # of watts for a fixed amount of time. Also, to clarify 1 joule is 1 watt for 1 second and a kJ is 1000 joules.\n\nFor Rider-A 180% of FTP is 360 watts (FTP+160 watts)  \nFor Rider-B 180% of FTP is 540 watts (FTP+240 watts)\n\nSo a 2-minute interval will bring Rider-A to a perfect failure point at 2-minutes (120-seconds) 120\\*160w = 19.2kJ of energy out of his 20kJ.",

        "text": "Blog Article: Designing The Perfect Interval Workout Using W'bal\n\n#### Starting with Progressive Overload\n\nAs most of you likely know, one of the key fundamentals of exercise is progressive overload. This means if you want to get stronger you need to go to failure or at least close to failure to tell your body it needs to repair itself and get stronger so next time this same exercise is easy.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0xYyOCvibyEmEczap.jpg)\n\n### How many intervals should I be\u00a0doing?\n\nEveryone knows that they have a limited amount of time, that they can sustain a hard-effort. We can clarify hard-effort as anything above your FTP. But how much time is that exactly? Meaning should I do four 2-minutes intervals @ 120% or maybe they should be 2:15 not 2-minutes. Since each athlete has a unique amount of anaerobic capacity (W\u2019). You should train with custom intervals matched to your personal W\u2019. You can hunt by trial and error, or you can use this cool TrainerDay feature called W\u2019 Balance (W\u2019Bal). This same feature has been in GoldenCheetah for a long time, but we feel we simplified it.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0ysY46bOrDhfas0UX.jpg)\n\n### Finding the perfect interval\u00a0workouts\n\nThis is a fairly deep subject but just starting with the basics is a huge step forward and something that many workout authors overlook. So for this article we are talking about intervals above your FTP. You want to tax your anaerobic system with just the right stimulus.\n\nThe basic idea is when you are above FTP your anaerobic work capacity (AWC or W\u2019) diminishes. Many people also call this \u201cburning matches.\u201d You only have so many matches to burn. Although when you drop below your FTP your W\u2019 recovers, or the match book fills back up, slowly. The great news is we have added W\u2019Bal to our workout creator.\n\n### 5000+ Is Too Many\u00a0Choices\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0WVmL4pI8fTbu_xpU.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0aQCWEwrcemsHW-_X.png)\n\nI would like to point out, I don\u2019t feel a 10-minute warm-up is enough, it should be closer to 20. It just improved the visibility in this example.\n\n### How to use the W\u2019Bal Calculator\n\nTurn on the W\u2019Bal feature. Enter your FTP or if you know it your CP in the CP box. Enter your W\u2019 ([how to calculate](https://trainerday.com/how-to-calculate-your-critical-power-cp-and-w/)) and you are good to go.\n\nThe red line shows you\u2019re predicted remaining energy and you can see at the end of this set of intervals your remaining energy is at the bottom this W\u2019Bal predicts you are completly fatigued at the end of the intervals. Perfect.\n\nMany scientific studies have proven the validity of these formulas.\n\nIn this example on the left, if you have a W\u2019 of 20kJ, and a FTP of 200, with those intervals, you will burn all your matches. The interesting thing is if you had a 300w FTP, you could not complete this workout (read [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|this article]] to find out why). Another benefit is that designing workouts that you know you should be able to finish can help inspire you to push a little farther. If you make this last interval a little farther and you can finish it (i.e. you can go below zero) that frequently means your W\u2019 or possibly FTP is likely a little higher than you thought.",

You set your target heart rate and just pedal your power will be automatically adjusted to keep you at your target heart rate.\n\n![Heartrate training mode. Perfect for Zone 2](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1EbQuHyEgyQD-730R4hJUuA.png)\n\nOnce you know your target heart rate your daily workout takes as little as 6-seconds to get started.\n\n1.

Click +\u200a\u2014\u200ain our app to set your target\n\nSo that is the easiest part. Just like determining your FTP. For Zone 2 training you should do a test to determine your target heart rate. If you prefer to keep it simple to start with you can can just train at 65% of your maximum heart rate and you can start training. You don\u2019t need to do anything else. But keep reading if you want to set everything up \u201cperfectly.\u201d\n\n**Percent of maximum heart rate vs percent of threshold heart rate.** Above I suggested 65% of maximum heart rate. If you don\u2019t know your maximum heart rate I provided a test you can do below.\n\nBut our app is designed so that heart rate works similar to power based training so we suggest you start by setting your threshold heart rate in our app.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1nlCxbl9XpKz-wSEQUlwG8g.png)\n\nThreshold heart rate is the same heart rate that you have when going as hard as you can for about 40 minutes. Because accuracy **does NOT affect your training** it does not need to be perfectly accurate but will improve your experience a little by setting the right scaling in our app. Also at the bottom we show your target % of threshold rather than your target of maximum heart rate. If you have your threshold heart rate set accurately. You can just set your target to 80% and that should be a reasonable Zone 2 target as well.\n\n**The best way to determine your target Zone 2 heart rate**\n\n![Zone 2 Heart Rate test using ERG mode on a smart trainer](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1lwv9_NqmII0sExACjPhegA.png)\n\nHere is a link to that workout.

        "text": "Blog Article: Mixing And Matching Cycling Modes For Indoor Training\n\nTrainerDay and other platforms have different modes for smart trainers and smart bikes. ERG is the most popular for workouts but even though we are the biggest ERG workout platform, we believe in a more wholistic approach. ERG is great for a specific purpose, but the other modes are great as well\n\nThe Four Modes of TrainerDay\n\n**Mode 1\u200a\u2014\u200aERG**\n\nERG is perfect for a few cases. One is when you just want to watch a movie or not think about the training itself but hit specific power targets. This is specially good for training in Zones 1 thru 4. It can also work reasonably well for Zone 5 with some adjustments. Most workouts are designed around your FTP but there is a [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|problem with workouts that are Zone 5 or higher.]]\n\nGenerally ERG is the main workhorse of indoor workouts. We believe training should be more dynamic based on how you feel, but ERG works well, you must might want to press the + or - buttons in our app at times. You don\u2019t need to kill yourself on the days that just feel a bit off.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1qQAVHxMXHWGJQWp3uWB0vQ.png)\n\n**Slope Mode**\n\nOur app has slope mode which you can instantly switch to at the click of a button. You also can design workouts that automatically switch to slope mode with a specific slope angle (design your own hills).\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1V3lIJfwpM6Ho4iv-r19e0Q.png)\n\nSlope mode is great because you can use your gears and cadence to control your power output and you can decide how closely you want to hit your desired power targets for each interval. It\u2019s just like Zwift but you can ride at a sustained specific slope as long as you want and more easily control your power output. ERG mode does not work well on short intervals, how short depends on the trainer you own but some where around 10\u201315 seconds are as short as works well in ERG mode, in that range it\u2019s better to manually control your power with slope mode. [[2023-01-01-smart-slopes-779c74a0c921.md|Read more here]]\n\n**Resistance Mode**\n\nResistance mode is like slope mode but instead up to a 25 degree slope (very rare to do 25%, 3\u201310% is more common) you specify resistance from 1\u2013100%. The actual power output depends on cadence and your specific model of trainer. We do not have any automatic resistance mode but really slope and resistance are the same and slope mode is more standardly used. You can switch from allowing switching Slope mode to using Resistance mode in our Other Settings.\n\n**Heart Rate\u200a\u2014\u200aHR Mode**\n\nHeart rate mode is a very specific mode that automatically controls your trainers power target (ERG mode) based on your target heart rate. If your heart rate is too high it will lower your power target and the opposite if it is too low. It moves very slowly giving your heart rate time to catch up. This works as a limit not an average. Meaning if you say 120 limit we try to keep it just under 120. Some people like ERG for the warmup and HR for some good Zone 2 HR based training.\n\nYou can see in this video you can design workouts that atomically switches in and out of any of these modes.\n\n[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK87_Seu658)",

Breathing harder than walking is a sign you are not taking it easy.\n\nRiding alone on an indoor trainer can be both boring and training. But in 2022, there isn\u2019t a lack of options for indoor cycling apps, and you\u2019ve come to the right place. Below are a few of the most popular indoor training apps, including the best for racing, training, exploring, and riding with real-life cycling footage.\n\nThere is also a blog about the three different types of indoor cycling. Remember, there are so many more options that a structured workout app, or a high-intensity virtual racing app. Many of the apps are even free to try.\n\nA Quick Guide to Indoor Cycling Apps\u200a\u2014\u200aZwift, TrainerDay, FulGaz, and More \\[LINK\\]\n\nThree Types of Indoor Cycling\u200a\u2014\u200aVirtual Outdoor, Power Intervals, & Spin Classes \\[LINK\\]\n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble deciding between the apps, try out a few of them. Many provide a free trial period which will give you plenty of time to learn the app, the workouts, and the overall feel, without the added pressure of committing to it long-term. If you\u2019ve never done structured intervals on the indoor trainer, consider this:\n\n**To Work Out, or Not to Work Out\u200a\u2014**\u200aBecause indoor training is stationary, there are fewer factors at play than outdoor cycling. There is no actual wind, speed, or distance; instead, it is all virtual. Indoor cycling apps estimate your speed and distance using power, which is measured in watts.\n\nPower meters can be attached to your bike in either the cranks, bottom bracket, pedals, or rear hub; or they can even be inside your indoor trainer. Power is unequivocally the most important and popular metric for cycling performance, used by Tour de France pros and local Joe\u2019s. You can train to get faster using a power meter and a structured training plan, which is what we do here at TrainerDay.\n\nIndoor training is a unique opportunity to get faster through structured interval training, distraction-free and without the constraints of wind, hills, traffic lights, or weather. You can jump on your indoor trainer any time of day and ride for 20 minutes or three hours\u200a\u2014\u200athe choice is yours.\u00a0  \nStructured interval training is the most effective and efficient way to improve your overall fitness and cycling power output, and there is no better place for it than the indoor trainer. Try one of the workouts from TrainerDay and see how it goes. Remember that this is not a test, and it is okay to fail. It is all part of the learning process, and I\u2019m sure that Mathieu van der Poel has failed more than a few interval sessions throughout his life. You will learn, get better, and come back stronger, ready to crush the next workout and keep progressing towards your cycling goals.\n\nOnce your trainer is ready and your app is ready to go, you\u2019ll want a few accessories to complete your indoor cycling set-up. In the article below, I give you some of my favorite indoor cycling accessories, including a few that I couldn\u2019t live without.\n\nWritten by Zach Nehr",

You can only do smart slopes in our training app. Smart slope workouts are especially perfect for short-intervals. On many smart-trainers ERG mode is not good for short- intervals. I think all trainers are bad for 5-second intervals in ERG mode. Science has shown that very short intervals can be a great minimalistic method of training.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0hGttUAsyWEYot4iW.png)\n\nSprinting in slope mode by shifting gears and increasing cadence makes it more like an outdoor sprint. Smart Slopes or automated slope mode allows the trainer to change slopes automatically, similar to Zwift except that you are programming the slopes. Slope workouts are very individual.\n\n**Slope mode workouts require practice.** Practice in creating the perfect workout and practice executing the workout. We will start creating a list of recommended slope workouts, but you will still need to perfect your gears and cadence to hit the targets. When you are creating workouts, you are setting the slope, but you are also setting the target power/percent. This target power is a visual representation of what you are trying to hit, but since you control the power output by changing gears and cadence, it\u2019s only a reference point.\n\n**Mixed slope and ERG mode.** If you have ever taken a 20-minute FTP test or 8-minute FTP test on most platforms, they go in and out of ERG and slope or resistance mode. You can design your own workouts to do exactly the same in TrainerDay. Any interval you can change to slope or erg just by clicking the switch in our app.\n\nSee our editor before on how to create slope workouts. You don\u2019t need to set slope in the interval type unless you want it to automatically change for you.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0pEOaLR0G1vagKEA9.png)\n\nTo use smart slopes you must have a premium account.\n\nIf you have a premium account now, you can start creating your first workout in our [workout creator.](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/create)\n\n[Upgrade Now](https://trainerday.com/pricing/)\n\n### A great example slope\u00a0workout\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0cymNak6fNn-586IU.png)\n\nHere is a [link to that workout](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/4-second-intervals)\n\n[https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/4-second-intervals](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/4-second-intervals)\n\nThis workout first increases slope right before the 4-second intervals.

Unlike outdoor cycling, which is subject to weather, traffic, and terrain variables, indoor cycling provides a controlled environment where every aspect of your workout can be precisely measured and optimized.\n\n## The Benefits of Controlled Training\n\nIndoor cycling offers several distinct advantages over outdoor training:\n\n**Consistent Power Output**: With a quality trainer, you can maintain exact wattage targets without the influence of wind, hills, or traffic stops. This consistency is crucial for structured interval training and threshold work.\n\n**Data Precision**: Modern smart trainers provide incredibly accurate power, cadence, and heart rate data. This precision allows for micro-adjustments in training that can lead to significant performance gains over time.\n\n**Time Efficiency**: No warm-up rides to training locations, no coasting downhills, and no traffic lights mean every minute on the bike is productive training time.\n\n## Training Zones and Structured Workouts\n\nThe ability to maintain precise power zones makes indoor cycling ideal for:\n\n- **Sweet Spot Training**: Sustained efforts at 88-94% of FTP\n- **Threshold Intervals**: Work at or slightly above your lactate threshold\n- **VO2 Max Intervals**: Short, high-intensity efforts to improve aerobic capacity\n- **Recovery Rides**: Easy-paced sessions for active recovery\n\n## Technology Integration\n\nModern indoor cycling setups can integrate with various platforms and apps, providing:\n\n- Virtual racing environments\n- Structured training plans\n- Real-time coaching feedback\n- Performance analytics and tracking\n\n## Creating an Effective Indoor Training Environment\n\nTo maximize your indoor cycling experience:\n\n1. **Ventilation**: Proper airflow prevents overheating and maintains performance\n2. **Entertainment**: Music, videos, or virtual platforms keep sessions engaging\n3. **Hydration**: Easy access to fluids is crucial for longer sessions\n4. **Data Display**: Clear visibility of power, heart rate, and other metrics\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIndoor cycling training, when properly executed, can be more effective than outdoor training for specific performance goals. The key is leveraging the controlled environment to focus on precise efforts that drive adaptation and improvement.\n\nWhether you're a competitive cyclist looking to fine-tune your power zones or a fitness enthusiast seeking efficient workouts, indoor cycling provides the tools and environment to achieve your goals systematically and measurably.",

        "text": "Blog Article: No Power Meter on Your Bike? No Problem: Heart Rate Training\n\nPower meters are great especially for short duration higher intensity intervals. But they are not a necessity for training smarter or getting faster. I would argue that many riders would be better off focusing on heart rate. I say this partially because it has been shown that easy rides are a corner stone of performance. Easy and heart rate based training go hand in hand. I would also argue that learning to judge your hard intervals by RPE (rate of perceived exertion) is a valuable step in cycling performance.\n\n![Garmin heart rate monitor cycling](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0fHcGTdsvE4Tmx55l.jpg)\n\nAs recently popularized, there are 3 primary training zones or intensity targets. Easy, moderate and hard. Arguably, breaking it down farther than this is not a critical component to getting faster. Most people do too much moderate and not enough easy and hard. You can google \u201cPolarized Training\u201d to get a better understanding of this.\n\nSo you can use TrainerDay to execute your heart rate based training. Using our calendar and converting Coach Jack workouts or for that matter any workouts to heart rate based workout is simple.\n\nSee below where you can click and convert any of our thousands of power based workouts to heart rate based workouts.\n\n![TrainerDay calendar\u200a\u2014\u200aheart rate training](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1lu6REHML_Rpe1WUZ-LCEAw.png)\n\nYou can also just search and find workouts and send them to the platform of your choice to perform heart rate based workouts.\n\n![Send heart rate based workout to TrainingPeaks](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1hdzp6glEjvyBJIUsTp9nHw.png)\n\nIf you train with power some times (for example indoors) and have a feeling of what Zone 3 should feel like. You can set up your own custom conversions from power to heart rate.

W\u2019 won\u2019t tell you anything. Even though over-unders like these below have an anaerobic component, they are primarily aerobic. W\u2019 can not predict the difficulty in these.

Micro-damage creates gains much faster than too-hard of efforts. Too hard of efforts frequently requires too much recovery, which slows your progress.

If you make this last interval a little farther and you can finish it (i.e. you can go below zero) that frequently means your W\u2019 or possibly FTP is likely a little higher than you thought.\n\n[View My Example W\u2019bal Workout](https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/45588/copy)\n\n### Watch a 6-minute video below showing you how W\u2019Bal works in TrainerDay\n\n[https://youtu.be/rrIc7LZ8Cjk](https://youtu.be/rrIc7LZ8Cjk)\n\n### Additional Reading\n\nHere is a good article describing the value of W\u2019 and W\u2019Bal\n\n[https://pezcyclingnews.com/toolbox/the-anaerobic-w/](https://pezcyclingnews.com/toolbox/the-anaerobic-w/)\n\nThe below link is deep but if you really want to understand, Mark from GoldenCheetah knows the ins and outs\n\n[http://markliversedge.blogspot.com/2014/07/wbal-its-implementation-and-optimisation.html](http://markliversedge.blogspot.com/2014/07/wbal-its-implementation-and-optimisation.html)\n\nThis video from Mark is a good balance between deep and useful\n\n[https://vimeo.com/100599100](https://vimeo.com/100599100)\n\nMark has done lots of writing and videos about W\u2019 and W\u2019Bal that are worth learning more about.

These indoor trainers don\u2019t measure power on their own, and you\u2019ll have to focus on your own effort to hit target wattages, or simulate riding up or down hills.\n\nYou can connect to external apps while riding a dumb trainer, but it won\u2019t be the trainer itself that is doing the connecting. Instead, you will need an external power meter (pedals, crank arm, or bottom bracket), a speed sensor, or a cadence sensor. If you choose to go with one of the latter two options, you won\u2019t actually be measuring your power in the app, but rather estimating your speed based on the sensor data.\n\nAs you could probably guess, dumb trainers cannot be controlled by external apps. Thus, you\u2019ll never get the feeling of riding up or down hills on a dumb trainer, you\u2019ll just have to shift gears instead.\u00a0  \nFor experienced indoor riders looking to simulate real-life riding, perform ERG mode workouts, or train or race competitively, we recommend a smart trainer for that extra level of overall capability.\n\nBeginner indoor riders can certainly start with a dumb trainer which is much cheaper than any smart trainer. You will still be able to perform intervals and change the resistance, but now it\u2019s up to you instead of the app.\n\nWritten by Zach Nehr",

        "text": "This is all based on established science. W\u2019 is a fixed amount of energy that you have above your FTP. You can do a fixed # of watts for a fixed amount of time. Also, to clarify 1 joule is 1 watt for 1 second and a kJ is 1000 joules.\n\nFor Rider-A 180% of FTP is 360 watts (FTP+160 watts)  \nFor Rider-B 180% of FTP is 540 watts (FTP+240 watts)\n\nSo a 2-minute interval will bring Rider-A to a perfect failure point at 2-minutes (120-seconds) 120\\*160w = 19.2kJ of energy out of his 20kJ. (See chart on the right\u200a\u2014\u200atop)\n\nFor Rider-B, 120\\*240w = 28kJ of energy. 28kJ is much bigger than his 20kJ available, he can\u2019t even get close to completing the two minutes. (See chart on the right\u200a\u2014\u200abottom)\n\nWe could say these two different riders have two different fitness profiles and need different anaerobic workouts to optimize their training.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0hJIesD4VbkZyJfpL.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0AeHkZVAYuIcNXo46.jpg)\n\n### The Solution\n\nThe above was a simple example.

If you add fr or free-ride to the interval type in our editor you will get Open-Ended workouts on your Garmin device. You must still include an amount of time for this. Generally I would put a time similar to what you think you might do.\n\nYou can push to Garmin or push to TrainingPeaks and this open-ended feature will work. One secret trick is if you put 60% in the target FTP% then it will actually show a target of 40\u2013100% on your Garmin meaning it really is a free ride.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0zawJbn2W3DGKdZy4.png)\n\n### Zwift\u200a\u2014\u200aFree\u00a0Ride\n\nAlthough Free-Ride and open ended are different concepts, I would argue the training focus might be similar. Meaning it\u2019s a bit unstructured. This is why we are calling them the same thing. Type \u201cfr\u201d or \u201cfree-ride\u201d in the type box. So a free-ride section on Zwift means that it goes into resistance or slope mode so you must change your gears to set the appropriate power. The only way to use this feature is in the ZWO file download. TrainingPeaks does not support this for example.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0bKgaLAlGlVoznhFA.png)",

solo rides do you want to increase your speed or improve your performance well the good news is that getting faster on your bike can be simply achieved by adhering to our four performance pillars keep watching because at the end of this video we offer a special bonus tip a cycling performance booster hi this is Alex from trainer day trainer day is an indoor outdoor training platform I work closely with Andrea Morelli Andrea is one of the top evidence-based cycling coaches in the world together we will bring you simple concise training advice optimizing your training volume is the first and most important pillar to improving your performance complex training plans and Magic workouts are unnecessary until you're approaching the limits of your personal performance Frank Overton of fast cat coaching is credited with being the pioneer of sweet spot and TSS based cycling in the following video clip Frank emphasizes that increase training volume alone is usually the key to your best seasonal performance and you know did you train more in 2019 than you did in 2018 if you did I bet you had a better season this would suggest that Frank also believes that volume is a more critical Factor than specific workouts or plans we would add to that and say that the right volume at the right time will usually provide you with your best results so what does the right volume at the right time mean it means rearranging your yearly cycling hours by decreasing at certain points in time and increasing others can yield substantially better results even if you're a time crunch cyclist pillar number two consistency it's optimal to have very consistent weekly patterns in your training volume if you're like me this may not happen if you have an incredibly busy week instead of your planned workouts you could fill it in with some very short indoor workouts evidence shows that 10 minute hit or Tabata session 20 minutes including a warm-up can augment your training gaps number three recovery performance gains happen during your recovery periods sleep is the most important method of recovery if you don't sleep at least eight hours a night eight plus being ideal start by turning off any screens an hour before your desired bedtime you can also try the weight lifter secret of taking zma zma contains the vitamin zinc and magnesium it's healthy and it works and it does not create the groggy morning feeling like melatonin if you train consistently patterns of daily weekly monthly and yearly recovery have been the gold standard for many decades for maximizing results taking a day or more off each week a week or more off each month and a few weeks off each year as well as a base period each season will give your body the rest it needs to increase to the next level if you have been cycling consistently and eating well but flatlined in your performance not having the right recovery pattern is probably the reason our fourth and final pillar is about workouts evidence suggests that if you are training six hours a week or more spend most of your time following low heart rate easy rides the start of your season could be all easy rides and slowly as your season progresses you increase the intensity for many cyclists going easy is more difficult than going hard getting fast requires self-control your harder workouts don't need to be complex and you don't need to kill yourself but you will see benefit from following a progressive overload pattern this means slowly and systematically increasing either your intensity your duration or both as Dr Seiler of polarized training points out hard efforts don't need to be incredibly hard and should be sustainable we take that a little further and suggest that you can start with easy intervals and build to hard intervals the polarized Studies have also proven that lower intensity weeks can beat higher intensity weeks so be very careful when you're trying to substitute intensity for volume for most cyclists the most important overload is regarding a weekly long ride you should try to fit in a long ride each week and start small and continually build the duration to your maximum occurring around a month before any event we feel that software platforms and many coaches have put too much emphasis on highly structured training that we also agree that simple moderate sustainable intervals will add horsepower to your already volume-based aerobic engine Outdoors Hills are a great place to do workouts either hill repeats or longer Hills can be Optimum higher intensity intervals and Hill training is most important as you get closer to your peak season ideally this follows a pattern of progressive overload as well and for our bonus tip popular and pro cycling in recent years during your peak season add full effort intervals this means pushing yourself to the maximum for two to",

        "text": "then you can see down here you can see your workouts and you can change anything in real time and just see how it affects your plan you can increase these sliders so if i increase my so here i start with a 35 minute and a 32 minute you know one hour and 30 minute but if i increase those hours you can see that it goes from 56 to you know it it it increases those hours right so so you can see that all in real time you can change your days in real time you know i took off the long ride so this day just shortened now i could take it off completely and you know and you can see it disappeared um and let's see so and then the final value is this starting intensity level generally we recommend everybody if you haven't been doing a lot of intervals lately or you're you're kind of starting your a build period we recommend everybody starting at one that doesn't matter if you're a pro or you're uh or you're a beginner you know you can start at one and it's going to feel easy our plans are different than other people's and again i'm going to create another video to explain the benefits there as well as do an interview with the top coach that will explain the concept behind that and and then once you know but you can increase it and when you increase it you can see here that let's shorten this a little bit and it makes it more obvious so when we calling this a threshold really this first threshold series is uh is actually just one this is a warm up with like a 30 second and then there's actually just a one minute threshold effort which is easy for basically everybody and it's comfortable and it's let's say reasonably enjoyable i mean if you're like killing yourself it's probably maybe not that fun and then as you get towards the end you can see then you have more and more and if we get you know if we get up here to 15 um let's go even farther so let's increase create this starting at four if we let's go back to here now you can see we actually have like a three minute interval so um that starts at like three minute threshold and i know for many people they'll think what this isn't even training but but trust me there is a different philosophy out there that you can get as much benefit and potentially even more benefit by doing shorter shorter sessions but doing the right sessions right and again i'll go into that in a later video so but then we get up here and we get into number 18 and and these get into you know i think it's two four-minute intervals so you get you end up with eight minutes of threshold which starts to be you know if you've gone through all 16 weeks it's not too bad i mean it's still intense you know threshold is threshold and it's always it's not especially indoors is not particularly always enjoyable but it gets into something more reasonable and there is kind of a progression it's a z2 z3 z you know z4 progression to get to that threshold so now we've got our our plan and we click on send weeks one to four to trainer day so this is much faster the other benefit is is that you can do the first four weeks try it out see how you like it and if you need to you can come back for the next four weeks and if you have to you can increase the intensity a little bit or modify your days or whatever and then you're not dealing with moving those workouts all around if you've got to move 16 workouts you know so 16 weeks of workouts around that's a huge amount of work and so dealing with one you know four weeks at a time or one month at a time you just come in you click four four weeks then you can come back in here and i can show you that later you can come back and create the next four weeks and and you can do that and we'll even start doing that automatically very soon creating that if you do one through four it will ask send you an email and ask you if you want to create the next one so so i'll go ahead and create weeks one through four here so here i have weeks one through four now they are in the trainer day plan editor now you can move works at workouts around you can do whatever you want with it you know you've got your basic structure down one thing i didn't show them the last one is the fourth week is always a is always a recovery week so we drop the threshold we reduce the intensity of the stress and the and the hours",

        "text": "Forum Q&A: Increase resolution of imported GPX\nCategory: Technical Issues\nTopic Type: Feature Requests\n\nQ&A 1:\nQuestion: First of all, thanks for putting this app together. It\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m looking for - I need TrainingPeaks imports and Strava exports of structured workouts with a BIG HUD running on my tablet while I watch youtube on the big screen on the wall, without having to subsidize features I don\u2019t like (gamification) and a racing league I\u2019m not participating in. I\u2019ve been experimenting with importing routes into slope mode. Specifically, Alpe du Huez from RideWithGPS. I also have imported several Alpe du Zwift workouts that include power data from Zwift. The imported workouts populate the workout editor at a resolution of one line per minute. This creates a reasonably decent facsimile of the route, tied to whatever my effort was for that workout. It mostly works, and I see the logic of it, but it\u2019s not the ideal solution. I have to know my target time before I start, and I lose some of the slope detail, especially around the gloriously flatter hairpins. Importing a TCX or GPX of just the route exported from RideWithGPS populates the workout editor with one line per KM. This is, frankly, not good enough for my needs. First, it completes a 10k warmup and the climb in about 37 minutes. I wish I was that fast. Stretching out the interval times for the climb in the GPX import can get me to the +/- 70 minutes I usually need to complete the climb, but then all I have are a handful of 4.5 minute intervals of 7-11% grade - and my tired old legs need those flatter hairpins. I feel like the ideal solution for the current workout builder would be to increase the resolution of the sample size during GPX import. I realize this is the most computationally expensive and therefore operationally costliest part of the operation. I\u2019d be willing to pay an additional premium to do this on your machines. If that\u2019s not possible, is there a tool I can use to convert GPX to the TrainerDay workout format locally? I know about gpsbabel, etc - but they don\u2019t do any slope calculation. Also, what is the maximum number of lines per workout? The ultimate solution would be to import a GPX and build a logical model of the slope that is independent of interval time, the way Zwift does it. I suspect that would entail a lot of reengineering on the backend though.\nContext: User is looking for a way to improve the resolution of imported GPX files for better workout accuracy.\nUser Problem: The current resolution of imported workouts does not meet the user's needs for slope detail.\nAnswer: Thanks for the compliment. I don\u2019t see the conversion process as such a problem but yes the number of steps is a problem, people created workouts in the past with 4,000 steps or something and it all started to crash\u2026 There is no exact limit but different phones cause different problems and even fast phones have a problem with too many steps. I would guess 500 steps is ok. So rather than increasing granularity if we just focused on mini slopes meaning if something is relatively the same slope and is 5km long we just create one step and bigger changes you create more steps. I would guess in many cases this might be enough but the logic to do this would be a bit temperamental for different routes. So to be honest the guys are very busy and we have not had any requests like this but for sure the current solution was just the quick and dirty way. You sound very logical and I would say with ChatGPT and other LLMs these days a logical and determined person could create a python version of making this work and generate a Zwift ZWO file. I would not mind even providing a little help if you can get it mostly working but get stuck with some parts of it. I actually have done a lot of route analysis in Python and know GPT will generate almost everything you need. I am old programmer and GPT almost makes me a real programmer again\nSolution: Focus on mini slopes instead of increasing granularity; potential for user to create a Python solution.",

It is a great complementary application to my training. I like to use progressions in my training over time. For example: a four x five minute block with two minutes of rest will be changed to a one minute rest. Once adapted to it, I will add another block of five minutes. I see there is an ability to add time, 10 seconds, to an interval, or increase/decrease power. What I am looking for is the ability to modify a workout, that I have created. I may be missing it, but once saved, except for what I mentioned above, I cannot find a more robust means to modify my workout, and re-save with changes. Such as reopening the workout in workout creation mode where I make a few modifications and get back to training. I am trying to avoid creating multiple workouts for with slight structural changes, like an added interval, or changing the finish of a workout. Thanks\nContext: User is new to TrainerDay and is looking for ways to modify workouts.\nUser Problem: Cannot find a robust means to modify saved workouts.\nAnswer: I assume you mean this? image2864\u00d71298 360 KB\nSolution: Clarification on the edit function.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thank you for the quick reply Yes\u2026that would be one workout IMG_1349828\u00d71792 115 KB IMG_1350828\u00d71792 86.8 KB I tried to upload two other screenshots, and that did seem to work. One was a 5 x 5\u2019 workout with 1\u2019 rest between. That was a workout I did today. Today, I did it with Z2 watts. If I was to that workout with sweet spot watts at this time of the year, I may want to increase the rest to 3 minutes. If I used Z2 watts again, I would use 8\u2019 blocks, which would increase the length of the workout at the same time. Ideally, if under an \u201cedit mode\u201d it brought me back to the original creation screen on the web application, I could quickly make my edits, save the changes, and get to work. I may be asking too much. In a usual week, I train intervals on Tuesday and Thursday. One day use short intervals, the other day is long intervals. I was hoping to have a workout template for each day. Modify it as appropriate for the time of season, or area of training I am focusing on, like 5 x 5\u2019s. I believe more experienced riders train this way. Plus, it saves on storage Just trying to keep it simple. Nothing fancy. Over the years I find simple works best. I do look at other workouts for ideas, and like the search capabilities of TrainerDay. Hopefully, this explains my question better!\nContext: User elaborates on their training routine and needs.\nUser Problem: Wants to modify workouts easily without creating multiple versions.\nAnswer: As R2Tom points out edit mode let\u2019s you edit it with original data. So I am confused. But maybe you are saying you would like to be able to edit in the app or at least click edit in the mobile app and open the web app? My guess is this would save about 10 seconds of time but maybe I am not understanding. Or maybe this 10-seconds is important\nSolution: Clarification on the user's needs regarding editing.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: @Alex BTW, we spoke once about editing a workout straight in calendar, any plans on it? My typical routine is that I copy a whole week in TP, paste it to the next and modify them exactly as @Oldmanbiker described. At TD I need to copy workouts, modify and paste new versions of them which takes longer. Rigid training plan is kinda inflexible.\nContext: User is asking about future features related to editing workouts in the calendar.\nUser Problem: Current process of modifying workouts is time-consuming.\nAnswer: Sorry some how this fell off my radar. That seems like a pretty reasonable request. What is the source of these workouts? Ones you create yourself, or clone from others or coach jack?\nSolution: Asking for more details on the user's workflow.",

It said to enter the HR bpm target into the Slope field, which I did. The problem is that it didn\u2019t work. If you populate this field and leave the power target empty, targets and resistance go to zero when you get to that interval. I went back in and populated both the power and HR targets, and the HR target worked! Design or bug?\nContext: Editing an existing workout with a new HR interval type.\nUser Problem: The HR target didn't work as expected when the power target was empty.\nAnswer: Hi, I have not even tested this yet. You are too fast It\u2019s two bugs actually. One is that power target should always be required, just so visually it looks like a reasonable workout. Second bug I think is related to this ERG / HR control issue we discussed. Once he fixes the second one I will test it and make sure but yes just enter ERG target to make it visually look good (and in this case work correctly).\nSolution: Enter ERG target to make it visually look good.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Ok, I tried to create an HR interval workout and use it\u2026 Didn\u2019t really work as you explain in the video (and I saw video just now, after testing). Work out had a worm up, then it was switching to HR mode for 148 BPM followed by 134 BPM for several intervals. What happened was this: Workout switched from ERG to HR mode The HR target was 128, ignoring what was set in the workout editor Stayed in HR mode until the end, ignoring switching to ERG mode for cooldown FTP % specified in the editor was NOT ignored, but set as specified for each interval The target power drop was too slow and small to make any noticeable impact on HR most of the time. The change in power should really depend on several factors, for example: How far actual HR is from target - farther it is, larger change required did previous interval end with HR on target? If not, it should continue adjusting from an appropriate level, not reverting to configured power I am planning to try a bit different setup and see if lower power values help.\nContext: Testing the HR interval workout functionality.\nUser Problem: The HR interval workout did not function as expected, with issues in switching modes and power adjustments.\nAnswer: Sorry we have a bug right now that power targets affects HR targets, this will be fixed next week. I should not have launched that video until this was fixed\u2026\nSolution: Bug will be fixed next week.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Bingo! I just did a mixed HR/ERG workout using yesterday\u2019s beta release, and struck no bugs at all. It worked perfectly thank you. I tried to trip it up with merging workouts and extending intervals, but it did what it should each time. I also noticed that when my HR was below target, the resistance seemed to increase earlier than before which I much preferred - was that changed or am I imagining it? The only minor request is that it would be nice to edit the workout name in 'My Activities' after the event as when you merge it picks up the added workouts name. I know I should edit it when finishing the workout, but sometimes you forget.\nContext: Testing the beta release of the HR/ERG workout.\nUser Problem: Curious about changes in resistance behavior and a request for editing workout names.\nAnswer: Looks good. It looks like you are not using ERG warmup in this one. There is still a small bug switching from ERG in the beta from yesterday but the new beta likely coming today should be perfect (finally, hopefully, I still need to do one last test). I don\u2019t think it goes any faster, although this stuff is complicated so my developer can make a mistake that improves it Yes activity renaming seems like nice feature, do you mind creating new topic for that so it\u2019s a feature request.",

Is that correct or am I still doing something wrong when getting a workout from TD onto my Garmin? Happen to be visiting family in the rural midwestern US where the roads and long and straight so no big deal, but at home not being able to get to a good segment before starting the next interval is more problematic. Couldn\u2019t find a recent forum topic on this but sorry if I just missed something.\nContext: User is trying to use TrainerDay workouts outdoors on a Garmin device.\nUser Problem: No lap breaks built into the workout.\nAnswer: Hi, when editing a workout you can just add \u201coe\u201d in our workout editor. OE standards for open ended. See below You can clone an existing workout and just add OE to the warmup for example. Coach Jack workouts should automatically add OE for warmup and cool down for Garmin. I am just switching from Wahoo back to Garmin, maybe I can test this soon\nSolution: Add 'oe' in the workout editor for open-ended segments.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thanks for following up! I haven\u2019t had a chance to test it much myself either, adding the OE to a workout has been easy enough to make sure it works, though to be honest I\u2019m almost always using my phone and not a computer so it\u2019s slightly awkward to do the workout editor and it would be great if it just pushed to garmin with lap button presses built in!\nContext: User is using the workout editor on a phone.\nUser Problem: Awkward to use the workout editor on a phone.\nAnswer: Oh strange, we just made some changes so maybe there is a new bug. We will look. CJ workouts should have lap button for warmup.\nSolution: Investigate potential new bug affecting lap button.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Just want to add I tried this again today and no luck, sent a HIIT workout from my plan to my garmin and there was no break from warmup, just dove right into the first set. I did want to clarify to make sure I\u2019m doing it right though as it seems like there\u2019s maybe a couple of different steps or ways I could get it to my garmin so maybe I\u2019m making a mistake? It seems like the easiest way to send a workout to Garmin is through the app using the send function, selecting Power and selecting Outdoor. That\u2019s what I did today and no luck on the lap button presses. But not sure if setting the workout to outdoor first in my calendar or something like that would have changed anything? I figured choosing to send it as Outdoor would accomplish the same thing and it seems like it did since it did the usual smoothing of the warmup ramps like it does when converted to outdoors.\nContext: User is trying to send a HIIT workout to Garmin.\nUser Problem: No lap button presses when sending workouts.\nAnswer: I need to test this, will do it today or tomorrow. In the past it worked \u201cSend to Garmin\u201d as outdoor. This Garmin sync with outdoor converted is a new feature. I will test that also. I assume you mean Coach Jack based HIIT. Any other workouts you must manually add your own open ended segments by first cloning it.\nSolution: Test the sending process and confirm if it works as intended.\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: Just want to add I tried this again today and no luck, sent a HIIT workout from my plan to my garmin and there was no break from warmup, just dove right into the first set.\nContext: User is following up on previous issues with sending workouts.\nUser Problem: No breaks in workout sent to Garmin.\nAnswer: Yes, I confirmed.

        "text": "Forum Q&A: Slope mode like ERG mode (completed)\nCategory: Feature Requests\nTopic Type: Feature Requests\n\nQ&A 1:\nQuestion: Hey everyone. I was going to start a thread on this exact topic . Good to see. I like Erg Mode for some structured workouts. The use case is: \u201cI want a % FTP that translates to a particular amount of work over a given time interval\u201d. Remembering that power = torque * rpm we end up with torque = rpm / power. If we agree that torque is the \u201cresistance I feel at the pedals\u201d, then resistance is constantly changing based on my pedalling speed. Faster pedalling = less torque and slower pedalling = more torque. Erg mode is great for many things - especially coaches who want to specify a power number and let the bike get the rider to do the correct amount of work. Sprint Interval Training is a different goal: \u201cGiven a specific gear or resistance level, what\u2019s the maximum power I can achieve and/or hold over a given time interval?\u201d. For any given gear, power = torque * rpm. If we agree that a gear translates to a measure of resistance applied to the pedals (optimally based om rider weight) then the power metric we are looking for is obtained by resistance * rpm. The higher the rpm, the happier I am. I think Free-ride mode is the starting point. Instead of requiring me to manually select a virtual gear and watch the power reading, TrainerDay could set a virtual gear during each block based on %FTP or watts. I can increase or decrease resistance with the -/+ 100% control. I still watch the power readings but I don\u2019t need to worry about resistance. I don\u2019t do Zwift but I think this is a good description of their slope mode. I can\u2019t find resistance training in any other smart bike software. My NordicTrack S22i spin bike had a programmable resistance mode that changed only resistance. I used it all the time. Erg mode is good. Free-ride sprints are still the best for me, even if I have to manually set my resistance.\nUser Problem: Need for a mode that allows for automatic resistance adjustments based on workout structure.\nAnswer: Very nice idea. You brought this forward in a way I had not considered. Zwift does automatic slope adjustments based on hills. We could do automated based on a workout structure. I had considered a similar idea which is allow you to upload a GPX and we will match the slopes but I figured it needed a new UI for this. Your idea means we could visually see slope adjustments just like ERG workouts and continue to use our same Training Tab. Here is just the idea in our workout editor image839\u00d7586 40.7 KB\nSolution: Automated slope adjustments based on workout structure.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: You got it Alex! Slope is the right metaphor. The use case is: \u201cLet me do a complete interval at a predetermined resistance level and see how I do in terms of power (watts)\u201d. If I pedal faster, I do more work. Pedal slower and I do less work. When doing intervals in this mode, the smart bike can set a calculated resistance level and doesn\u2019t need to hunt for a given wattage based on cadence like Erg mode has to. Think of this way. In Erg mode, I want to the bike to create a calculated amount of work over a time interval regardless of cadence. This produces measurable results that can be used by coaches and riders to build and monitor a training plan. We get numbers like 400w for 1 minute. That\u2019s fits nicely in spreadsheet and everyone is happy. In slope mode (I have already adopted your term Alex - thanks), I want to do strength training. I want the bike to set an appropriate resistance that I use over a time interval. The overall (a.k.a., average) work performed during the interval is less interesting than the associated telemetry. What were the maximum watts I hit? How long did stay at a given power level? What\u2019s my HR relative to resistance?",

        "text": "Forum Q&A: Unwanted Zwift synchronization\nCategory: Technical Issues\nTopic Type: Technical Issues\n\nQ&A 1:\nQuestion: When I entered the custom workout section of Zwift a few days ago I could see all my Trainier Day workouts, even though I didn\u2019t want them to be there. There was no active connection between Trainer Day and Zwift. So, the first thing I did, I deleted the workouts in Zwift. In the following Zift session all the workouts were there again. Next I tried to cut all possible connections via other apps like Strava or Garmin. Trainer Day now has no connection to any other app. Again I deleted the Trainer Day workouts in Zwift, quit and started Zwift again. To my surprise all my Trainer Day workout again showed up in the custom workout section of Zwift. How ist this possible? What do I have to do that Trainer Day does not automatically push any workouts to Zwift?\nUser Problem: Unwanted Trainer Day workouts appearing in Zwift\nAnswer: We don\u2019t have any connection to Zwift and don\u2019t push anything there. Zwift uses this folder syncing process and must have some issue. If you run multiple computers or something you might need to do this. I bet google or Zwift forums have a solution.\nSolution: Check for folder syncing issues or consult Zwift forums.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: None of my Trainer Day workouts are stored locally. I only have them in the web app. So why should a folder syncing process be responsible for pushing the workouts to Zwift if there is no folder with workouts?\nUser Problem: Confusion about folder syncing and workout storage\nAnswer: We have no connection to Zwift. We tried to get it but they said no. Really the only way to get workouts in that customer workout folder is by copying them there. We have a video on YouTube showing how to copy workouts to this folder for example. You have to trust me it is impossible for us to push anything to Zwift although TrainingPeaks has a feature that gets workouts in Zwift. But that is called WOD and only shows a couple workouts. If you have a TrainingPeaks account you could look at your TrainingPeaks calendar.\nSolution: Refer to the YouTube video on copying workouts.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: In my workout folder of my Windows PC there\u2019re only the workouts that I created in Zwift. Zwift support suggests that the workouts could come from Training Peaks. They found out that there is a connection between Zwift and Training Peaks even though my profile showed this as disconnected. Nevertheless, I haven\u2019t set up a connection between Trainer Day and Training Peaks\u2026 I asked Zwift to disconnect Training Peaks. When this is done I will try to delete the workouts again.\nUser Problem: Confusion about connections between Trainer Day, Zwift, and Training Peaks\nAnswer: Ok please let me know what you find. Do you have a PC or Mac? Did you look in the zwift folder? This article might help you. Zwift Zwift How-to: Importing and Sharing Custom Workouts | Zwift Want to share a custom Zwift Ride workout with friends? Or perhaps you're looking to use a custom workout from a friend, coach, or other online source?\nSolution: Check the Zwift folder and refer to the article.\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: I guess I can\u2019t expect any further support from Zwift. It seems they use some kind of failed AI to answer support requests. Their answers were really strange. Regarding my problem, I found out that the Zwift app shows historic workouts. They don\u2019t reflect any changes I made in between.\nUser Problem: Frustration with Zwift support and historic workouts\nAnswer: Sorry to hear. I would uninstall Zwift from all devices and make sure in both TP and Zwift they are not connected to each other and then reinstall Zwift.\nSolution: Uninstall and reinstall Zwift, ensuring no connections to Training Peaks.\n\nQ&A 5:\nQuestion: Ok, I found a solution!",

        "text": "Forum Q&A: Power Match refinement\nCategory: Feature Requests\nTopic Type: Feature Requests\n\nQ&A 1:\nQuestion: Hi Alex Super happy with how slope mode is working for me and this is what I will use most of the time. However sometimes it is nice to have a bit of a change and so I have been using Erg mode and it is not quite working for me like it used to on TR. My Neo 2 over reads compared to my Assioma Duo\u2019s at endurance power. At sweet spot they are sort of similar and then at Vo2 the Neo under reads compared to my Assioma. So jumping from 40% recovery to 120% intervals really kills me as the power match takes about 30 seconds of about 130-140% effort before it recalibrates the power match off set to bring me down to 120%. Is it possible for the power match algorithm to be reworked such that it is a bit more responsive? Many thanks for all your help. Karl\nContext: User is comparing performance between different modes and devices.\nUser Problem: Power match takes too long to recalibrate during intervals.\nAnswer: There is a bug going from slope mode to erg with power match, but yes we also need to create a new version of power match. Another solution is to turn off power match, but it will still record power from pedals, and just press - to slight adjust actual target. This should give you exactly what you need if your offset is consistent and you don\u2019t mind that actual shows different then target by a little\nSolution: Turn off power match and manually adjust the target.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I understand entirely and thank you for your comments. I have done a work around for myself in line with your comments. Initially I did a dual recorded workout (TD - Neo Erg / Garmin - Assioma) with TD setting the erg power for all of my common interval FTP percentages. From the data I created a little spreadsheet showing the results and what the Neo Erg needs to be set at so that Assioma\u2019s power is appropriate. Then I made Erg mode versions of my upcoming workouts with the FTP percentages suitably adjusted (ie 40% is now 45%, 108% is now 106%, 125% is now 120% etc). Then in the interval comments I put the real target watts for me to monitor on my Garmin watch and make on the fly adjustments as necessary. Worked perfectly the first time I tried it with Neo only connected to TD and Assioma\u2019s only connected to Garmin. Disregard the TD workout & save the Garmin workout.\nContext: User implemented a workaround to adjust power settings.\nUser Problem: Need for precise power settings during workouts.\nAnswer: Oh thank you for the feedback. My thinking is that level of precision is not that important (Our Coach Andrea generally thinks so as well) and if you agreed you could just connect both assioma and neo to our app and press -5% and make your warmups a little harder in general. At least you could just design your workouts normally. If your process does not bother you then it\u2019s not the end of the world as our editor is fast if you don\u2019t have a million workout variations Also I understand some people are just perfectionists or there are always \u201cit depends\u201d situations that precision is required. If you are doing a 2X20 then accuracy becomes more critical even if just from a mental perspective In my solution your completed line would be a bit above the blue target (target shows 150w and actual shows 160w) in our app but you could just use our app. You still might use the Garmin to record with at the same time to get it in GC but at least it would be secondary to watching our screen. I will keep this in mind. We could just create an offset matrix as well. Like \u201cmanual/auto power match\u201d that would be much easier than power match 2.0. This discussion helps me in general so thanks.\nSolution: Consider connecting both devices and adjusting the target power.",

If not, what is the difference and best use case for resistance vs. slope mode?\nContext: Cyclo7 switched from Trainerroad to Trainerday and is using the iOS app with an Elite Suito trainer.\nUser Problem: Understanding the differences between resistance mode and slope mode.\nAnswer: Yes slope mode is something built into the trainer not something we \u201cinvented,\u201d yes Wahoo calls it levels. It simulates a slope just like outdoors.\nSolution: Clarified the function of slope mode and its relation to outdoor simulation.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: When in \u2018slope mode\u2019 I noticed the app displays an \u2018Offset\u2019 indicator. I suppose this is just the difference between the slope level when starting the workout vs. the level you\u2019re at?\nContext: Cyclo7 is trying to understand the Offset indicator in slope mode.\nUser Problem: Clarification on the Offset indicator in slope mode.\nAnswer: The reason we show the offset in slope mode is because you can design slope workouts in our workout editor and so yes it\u2019s the offset between the original value and current.\nSolution: Explained the purpose of the Offset indicator.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: When my trainer and power pedals are simultaneously connected, is the cadence measurement from the pedals or is it estimated from the trainer?\nContext: Cyclo7 is inquiring about cadence measurement sources.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about the source of cadence measurement.\nAnswer: I can\u2019t remember cadence source, I will have to check that.\nSolution: Acknowledged the need to verify the cadence source.\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: Is there a screen that displays the battery level of connected devices (power meter, HRM, sensors\u2026)?\nContext: Cyclo7 is looking for battery level indicators for connected devices.\nUser Problem: Lack of information on battery level indicators.\nAnswer: No battery level indicators.\nSolution: Confirmed the absence of battery level indicators.\n\nQ&A 5:\nQuestion: I usually use the quick start function: is there a setting to change the auto-extend interval duration? Now it seems fixed at 5 minutes.\nContext: Cyclo7 is inquiring about settings for the quick start function.\nUser Problem: Desire for customization in the quick start function.\nAnswer: in iOS, long press the button, a pop up will appear.\nSolution: Provided a workaround for changing the auto-extend interval.\n\nQ&A 6:\nQuestion: I believe there is a small bug when you hover over your weekly hours when in the \u2018my activities\u2019 tab. I had a 30+ hour cycling week last year and it seems these hours are not correctly displayed in the yellow/orange pop-up box when hovering.\nContext: Cyclo7 is reporting a potential bug in the web interface.\nUser Problem: Inaccurate display of weekly hours.\nAnswer: We will investigate the popup.\nSolution: Acknowledged the issue and promised to investigate.\n\nQ&A 7:\nQuestion: Because it peaked my curiosity I was toying around with Coach Jack a little bit. I know this is a very specific/rare use case for most of us, but is there a reason why the starting hours for each block are limited to 16 hours? Any training/physiology reasoning behind this?\nContext: Cyclo7 is asking about the limitations in Coach Jack.\nUser Problem: Curiosity about the rationale behind the 16-hour limit.\nAnswer: We feel that hours modulation is one of the most important factors in performance but I know there are always exceptions to everything and especially if you came mid-season to TD and needed a peak plan for 8 weeks or something.",

I think this functionality used to exist, but somehow got lost in one of the updates. Browse and search full workout library (with internet connection) Edit workouts within the app: doesn\u2019t have to be in a slick mobile format for now; it could simply be the same interface as the website. Or even a link to directly open the workout in the mobile browser edit/save, and re-sync in the app.\nUser Problem: Missing features from the web app in the mobile app.\nAnswer: Hi, you are right!!! We changed from web view to mobile view for details which is much faster but we lost the click to see the intervals. We will add this back. #2 You can search all workouts now in the app, do you mean review without searching? #3 Is the only thing you personally want is to change target power or duration of intervals? Just currious. We would probably add a link to the web site because it is a lot simpler. Just trying to understand your workflow and desires.\nSolution: We will add back the click to see the intervals.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I would primarily want to be able to change/add slope changes as most workouts in the library don\u2019t have them. I\u2019d also like to be able to add additional sets or reps and change the duration of the work/rest intervals.\nUser Problem: Inability to modify workouts effectively on mobile.\nAnswer: Can you explain? I am a bit confused on this. You can clone any workout you want and add slopes to it. And you can press \u00b1 in the app to change the slopes if you turn off ERG.\nSolution: You can clone workouts and add slopes.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Yes, but only from the web app. If I\u2019m browsing for a workout from the lists on the app, I\u2019d like to be able to clone and modify it quickly without having to get to a PC.\nUser Problem: Need for quick modifications on mobile without a PC.\nAnswer: You can do this using web browser on the phone but I realize in app would be ideal. I plan to make a super fast in app workout editor but it might just be a simple creator that will create new workouts but might partially solve this. We actually have 2 ways to modify your workout as you are training. Reducing length or increasing length in general are super easy with skip and extend as well as the auto extend setting. You can change your default interval extend interval time by holding it down. +10s can be +5m for example. Then using + - you can set the desired intensity. Assuming you are talking about increasing the number of intervals in a workout there are two options for this. I actually find getting good at this process makes it easy to dynamically change the workout but if you want it all automatically setup before you start training I realize this is not optimal.\nSolution: Plans for a fast in-app workout editor and existing methods to modify workouts.\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: Yep, I do have a \u201cblocks\u201d list, and that works well for changes on the fly. Most of the time that have to browse and plan workouts is when I\u2019m not at a PC. The workout editor that is second to none from a computer is difficult to navigate from a phone. Perhaps another solution would be to modify the mobile version of your site to be more phone/touch friendly. Smartsheets\u2019 app is a great example of how to turn a grid spreadsheet into something easier to navigate on mobile.\nUser Problem: Difficulty navigating the workout editor on mobile.",

I\u2019m not using CJ now, but when I did Zwift would yell at me for too slow of a cadence often Dave\nSolution: Using Zwift with TrainerDay workouts and not double recording.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Hi Dave, thanks for your reply, your method is better than mine\u2026 I synced Zwift with Garmin No more double log So, workout in Zwift ==> file sent to Garmin ==> file sent to Intervals.icu Right ??? Regading cadence if you use a Zwift workout from their library you will see a warning on the top left part of the screen (where the stars are) but if you use a CJ workout you see nothing until you are in the segment (hope I am not mistaken)\u2026 But, how can CJ suggest the best next plan for me if he knows nothing about what I have done in the previous weeks ??? After 12 weeks training I might increase my FTP, adjusting it in my profile would be enough in order to help CJ create the best plan for me ??? Lots of questions, I know\u2026 Ciao, Erik Il Rosso\nUser Problem: Confusion about how CJ can create a personalized plan without knowing past training data.\nAnswer: Erik, Yes, I think you\u2019re correct on both #1 and #2. I still have Strava set up so for me I think Intervals is getting the data from there, but Garmin could also work. I think you\u2019re also correct about cadence. I don\u2019t recall seeing a cadence requirement until I was into the interval. I would describe CJ as a static plan, you generate it up front and then work through the plan. It won\u2019t \u201cadapt\u201d mid plan or change FTP. You\u2019d have to test again at some point to see what your FTP has done. When you\u2019re ready for another CJ plan you would need to go through the creation process again. I understand CJ will look at your recent hours during that process so perhaps the hours would go up because of your recent training history? Alex could comment with better details me about the CJ stuff. If you try my method for Zwift/Garmin etc\u2026 probably do it with a 10 minute ride and have a trial to see that it is working. I\u2019d hate to see you go through a 90 minute ride and find out there is a problem.

A sorting filter would be much useful where we can sort authors along their proficiency and qualifications as professional trainers or coaches.\nContext: Discussion about the quality of workouts available on the platform.\nUser Problem: Difficulty in identifying qualified workout authors.\nAnswer: Hi, you are correct. Anyone can create workouts. Actually due to an individuals physiology, recovery state and propensity for suffering, the right workout at the right time is highly individual. We would argue that it\u2019s better to start under your current intensity threshold and slowly build up to reach and increase that workout intensity threshold. This is our belief which including my partner a world tour coach (Andrea Morelli) that is in a unique space so he has also coached many amateurs for the last 30+ years. Many coaches are almost like spin bike leaders and prefer to just making your start suffering from day one. While this can produce more rapid results it is much more risky and is not the best for longevity of training. Coach Chad at TrainerRoad used to preach \u201cminimum effective dose.\u201d I don\u2019t believe the TrainerRoad platform delivers on this idea but this message resonates with me and I have a lot of respect for Chad as well. Do just enough to get the adaption you need. So this said, I think without a coach it\u2019s a bit of trial and error to find what works for you. There are a lot of classic workouts that are very, very hard 4X8min @ nearly VO2max, 2X20min @ threshold. These are painful and I suggest gradually working your way up to them but in reality we don\u2019t even think you need to go that far. So all this said, I would say creating a workout is a neophyte process because finding the right workout for you is a bit of trial and error. This is the beauty of Coach Jack based workouts, as they start easy and build to hard and very much follow a pattern of progressive overload that anyone can follow. If you don\u2019t want to follow a strict calendar and are training indoors you can create a coach jack plan and push it to \u201cmy plans\u201d make that plan active in our app and then you can just follow the plan one workout after the next as you have time to do them. All this said, I would love to have workout authors fill out their bio\u2019s but most of the popular workouts here are actually just long running ideas of workouts coaches and platforms have suggested over a long period of time. Many coaches use our platform but coaches have always used their own personal workouts as \u201csecret weapons\u201d although most top coaches actually agree the workouts themselves are not the secret but the specific plan including the right volume patterns for the right athlete are 80-90% and the workouts are secondary to this. FYI: I used to try to get authors to give bios, but it was not working. So I fully agree/agreed with your thinking here If you need more explanation in simple terms. Use coach jack or just ask and I can give you a few ideas on the basics. We have similar beliefs to Joe Friel, author of the cyclists training bible.\nSolution: Use Coach Jack based workouts for progressive overload.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: If I find favorite authors, that would be nice to be able to download their workouts in batch instead of one at a time.\nContext: Follow-up on the discussion about workout authors.\nUser Problem: Inconvenience of downloading workouts one at a time.\nAnswer:",

It\u2019s just that the recovery intervals are slightly too short so this amount suffering is digging a bit too deep, or possibly not possible depending on his W\u2019. I am not sure below is exactly what he has but depending on his FTP and W\u2019 you can see this is doable but for sure very hard. Most people don\u2019t want to dig this deep.\nSolution: Acknowledges the workout's difficulty and the need for longer recovery.\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: I\u2019m sending all trainings to garmin edge 530, so I guess there is no other way to edit it? nevermind, I founded a method\nContext: User is using Garmin Edge 530 for training.\nUser Problem: Limited options for editing workouts when using Garmin Edge 530.\nAnswer: \n\nQ&A 5:\nQuestion: Hi Damianix, There are different ways to approach a workout. Let me start by saying this is not an easy workout. In VO2max training, the rest often defines the purpose of the workout. In this workout, there seems to be a 1: 1 ratio. It takes about 10 minutes to complete two full cycles, so intervals are approximately 2.5 minutes. With 6 reps, the total training time is around 15 minutes. That is about the most time you want to spend in this zone during one training session. Even the pros don\u2019t spend more time in zone 5. Since you are probably not a pro, it is not a shame you can\u2019t finish this workout. This particular workout comes in many shapes and sizes.",

        "text": "Forum Q&A: Advantages of using the trainer day app vs doing workouts outside of the app (i.e. zwift or other simulators)\nCategory: Integrations & Export\nTopic Type: Technical Issues\n\nQ&A 1:\nQuestion: I was wondering if there are any advantages/disadvantages of exporting workouts from a training plan via TP to an app like Zwift, MyWhoosh, etc. Mainly in terms of Trainerday feature losses or degradation given that there maybe some data loss since the workouts are outside of the Trainerday app. Maybe no data is loss, but I figure it possibly does lose some fidelity or at least the ability to adapt a training real time base on performance Cheers\nUser Problem: Concerns about data loss and fidelity when exporting workouts.\nAnswer: Great question. It depends on how you export workouts, if you export ZWO files and load to Zwift folders there is minimal or I believe zero loss, going through TrainingPeaks loses a little bit (interval comments, ramps, \u2026) I would say generally there is not enough loss that it should be a major factor in your decision. I would say train in the way or with the platform that is most enjoyable to you. Coach Jack builder is a static plan builder and I recommend continuing to make your own changes to your plan which can be done easier if you only export one day or one week at a time for example. I don\u2019t love how Zwift ERG works (less flexibility) so for example if you can use Ant+ with Zwift you could use our app to control it. But again it\u2019s not a big deal.\nSolution: Export ZWO files for minimal loss; adapt training based on personal preference.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thanks, Alex. Since I am not a premium TP member, I am syncing the workouts with TD one day at a time. I noticed that when I completed one of the Coach Jack workouts, it didn\u2019t mark it as completed. It showed up in the TD calendar via the integration with Strava, but the workout still showed as not completed. Is the expected? How can I update a training plan that is already on the TD calendar? For example, increase the number of days once I am in week 2, and making the change effective on the TD calendar.\nContext: User is not a premium TrainingPeaks member and is syncing workouts daily.\nUser Problem: Workouts not marked as completed and difficulty updating training plans.\nAnswer: If the workout is on you calendar and you are performing that workout in MyWhoosh and we get it from strava yes it should auto mark it as completed on the calendar. If you click edit plan at the top of the calendar, you can add a day in the plan builder and auto update the calendar.\nSolution: Ensure workout is on the calendar; use edit plan to add days.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Alex, there seems to be a bug on completing the plans on my whoosh. I suspect you are all doing matching on the workout name and mywhoosh is adding a short string to the workout once completed. I send my workout from my plans to trainingpeak. It then populated the workout on the mywhoosh calendar. I completed the workout and uploaded to trainingpeaks and strava. THe workout shows up in the TD calendar, but in the training plan is still showing as not completed. Here is the Calendar view. The workout highlighted name on the calenadar is \u201cMywhoos - Collywobbles 45\u201d\nContext: User suspects a bug related to workout name matching.\nUser Problem: Workouts not marked as completed due to potential naming issues.\nAnswer: You do not have this plan on your calendar. You have it in my plans. You can send it from my plans to your calendar but even better is to send it directly from CJ to your calendar. Unless there is a bug of some sort.",

It\u2019s possible you could create your workouts in golden cheetah and they might have an average power feature. Then you export and import to trainerday. Definitly less convienient. You also can get a feel that the more ups and downs you have in power, so especially stuff over 100% of FTP you willl get a bigger difference between normalized and average. So vo2max workouts are probably 10% off for example, so you could just adjust them. I would say exact precision on average power is un-necessary but your coach might have his own ideas on this.\nSolution: Discussed normalized power vs average power and suggested using Golden Cheetah.\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: There are 3 average power which are monitored by coaches or self coached athletes. a) Average Power with zero values Is quite important for outdoor rides e.g. if you coast downhill, your Average Power will decrease. b) Average Power without zero values Is less important. c) Weighted Average Power e.g. NP, CP is more important e.g. to calculate training stress. Other useful metrics exist as Intensity Factor or Variability Index. For sophisticated analysis you may use Training Peaks, Strava, Xert, Golden Cheetah (for free). Please keep Trainer Day simple.\nUser Problem: Need for clarity on average power metrics.\nAnswer: Thanks Rolf, yes, we all want simple but our own version of simple so 100 versions of simple in one product is not so simple\u2026 but don\u2019t worry our goal is to make it more simple/clean in 2023. I am not so aware of the use of average power in indoor workout creation. But yes I analysis is another mater. I don\u2019t understand the purpose of creating target average power for a planned workout. Meaning a workout should have a physiological purpose, for example z2 aerobic or Vo2max intervals and some coaches are targeting specific tss goals which uses normalized power and time. I guess there are a million coaches all with different ways of working.\nSolution: Acknowledged complexity and discussed physiological purpose of workouts.\n\nQ&A 5:\nQuestion: Workout creation: I completely agree in focus e.g. on specific zones e.g. Z2 or VO2max,\u2026 You may want to reach certain TSS goals (indoors and outdoors) I can\u2019t see it in GoldenCheetah V3.6 from July 2022: avrg Power, Stress Score,\u2026 But W\u2019 is available in the Workout Editor as well as in Trainer Day.\nUser Problem: Need for specific metrics in workout creation.\nAnswer: Yes it would be easy to copy and paste to excel and get the average. And copy and paste back. Adding every additional field adds complexity even though it seems like a small request. I really try to understand and consider each request.\nSolution: Discussed the complexity of adding new fields.\n\nQ&A 6:\nQuestion: Honestly its no problem Alex\u2026 Its not a regular thing I need to do its just every so often.

TD sets the power to 150W, I start and then after 3-5 seconds, I\u2019m already at 50W and bam the power is becoming so hard I can\u2019t pedal anymore. I have 2 assioma pedals. I tried to play with many different options: smooth power, power match\u2026 Nothing works. I don\u2019t know if the issue is coming from the Elite Suito since I don\u2019t know what TD is requesting the trainer to do. Resistance mode is fine but I need to train in ERG mode.\nContext: User is experiencing issues with ERG mode on a second-hand Elite Suito.\nUser Problem: Can't use ERG mode effectively; power drops drastically.\nAnswer: Hi we have a Suito and it works fine. I would start with only the suito connected and see how it works. Still having problem try re-installing our app, for some reason that seems to help some strange problems. Make sure no garmin, wahoo or other device could be connecting to the trainer.\nSolution: Start with only the Suito connected, reinstall the app, ensure no other devices are connected.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I would be very happy to use back Trainer Day ! Note that I\u2019m a paying customer of TD until September 25, 2025 and I took a monthly subscription of TR (20 euros/month is really too expensive on their side). BTW, one feature I like there are the comments during the workout.\nContext: User expresses willingness to return to TrainerDay and mentions a subscription to TrainerRoad.\nUser Problem: Frustration with TrainerRoad's pricing and features.\nAnswer: Oh cool. You mean the popups when you are working out with nice tips and stuff? I am happy to add some months to you account as soon as we can fix this. It really seems to only be an issue if you get to low RPM on a hard interval and they Suito seems to become impossible to pedal. We are testing if just pressing the down arrow temporarily helps in this locked up state. But we think we know exactly how to fix this. It seems to only affect Elite. This is this \u201cSpiral of death\u201d is what everyone calls it. We did not know how to duplicated until we saw your message and tested it.\nSolution: Will add some months to the account once the issue is fixed; acknowledges the 'Spiral of death' problem.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: BTW, is there an API where I could import my own workouts and plans?\nContext: User inquires about importing workouts.\nUser Problem: Need for a way to import custom workouts.\nAnswer: We have the functionality to add text descriptions in our workout editor and some workouts that people create have them, our import ZWO file for example supports adding them. We don\u2019t have any public API for importing workouts or plans. It would be a bit risky as we don\u2019t have a ton of validation but you could do it via non-public fairly simply. Just go to the create workout page to see them.

They have prescribed zbit training programs that I\u2019m wondering if anyone has made TrainerDay programs for (they are various 60 on 10 off etc) I find it hard to figure out how to pedal to keep up with the changes in the program and before trying to crate the workouts myself wondering if they exist. Thank you\nUser Problem: I find it hard to figure out how to pedal to keep up with the changes in the program\nAnswer: That\u2019s an interesting product. I just did a brief look. It\u2019s a cool idea in general but I need to look at it more. So when you say program in I assume you mean program in HR targets? Right now I want to remove all public workouts (I don\u2019t think there are very many public ones now) with HR targets since we use specific HR not % of threshold or something else. Our workout creator is super fast and you could even use ChatGPT to generate excel spreadsheets possibly and then copy and paste the workouts into our editor (just an idea).\nSolution: You could use ChatGPT to generate excel spreadsheets possibly and then copy and paste the workouts into our editor.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Is there a way to program that so that TD mirrors what their app is trying to get you to do?\nUser Problem: Wondering if TrainerDay can replicate the Morpheus app's workout structure.\nAnswer: Yes but realize for example \u201call out\u201d or as hard as you can is not something you can program, it\u2019s something you must do. You can program very hard in ERG but any particular day you can be stronger or weaker. I will post an example of how to program this.\nSolution: You can program very hard in ERG but must manage effort manually.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Is there a way to program that so that TD mirrors what their app is trying to get you to do?\nUser Problem: Wondering if TrainerDay can replicate the Morpheus app's workout structure.\nAnswer: So there are multiple approaches to how to solve this problem. One is the \u201cperfect\u201d way from a TrainerDay workout creation standpoint which is design the workout exactly true to what they are saying. Like this image image2464\u00d71784 412 KB For the 2 minute HR segment press >> button to extend 2 minutes to what you need it to be during the workout until you get to z2/blue zone (turn on our zones in settings). Next time you can set this to the time you actually need, some people might be 2 minutes some might be 5 minutes. I feel that is a bit complex, I would do it simpler (I can explain a simple workout if you need) Another final way is do it more like outdoors and do it all manually. And just not program it Click on quick start and click slope mode for 1% Warmup watch your HR so it gets to the top of zone 2 Increase slope to about 4-6% Shift gears and go as hard as you can for 10-15 seconds lower slope to 1% or shift down and watch your HR until it gets back to Zone 2,6) Repeat step 3,4,5 - 10+ times cool down.\nSolution: Multiple approaches to create the workout, including manual adjustments.",

Just tried yesterday the app with premium account and i\u2019ve found everything i need for my training since i used to use only Zwift companion app during my session. I have a couple of questions that i didn\u2019t find in the forum, sorry if somebody already asked: i read about \u201cresistance mode\u201d, but i didn\u2019t find one, during my training i saw only hr, erg and slope. Am i missing something? is there a way to customize data fields (aside of tapping on them)? Especially power, is there a way to have 3s or 10s power output? is there a way to set manually power and hr zones instead of letting the app calculating them by entering ftp or treshold? -last one, is it possible to load an outside course from an outside garmin activity and train with it so having trainerday replicating it? thank you very much\nContext: User is transitioning from Zwift companion app to TrainerDay.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about features like resistance mode, data field customization, and manual zone settings.\nAnswer: Welcome. Resistance mode is by turning off sim/slope in other settings You can turn smoothing on which should partially do this but no way to customize fields other than tapping. No, we just use Coggan zones at this time. We have two features a broadcast UI (youtube video, I can find it if you need) and you can upload a course to it but it has no affect on your power you can go to our create workouts page and upload a workout and it will set the slopes or ERG power targets but the ERG power targets are very rudimentary. The only product that actually does this well that I know of is BestBikeSplit but I think the only option is an expensive one, but it will generate ZWO file with ERG targets that are the optimum targets you would use for a TT race but it is a bit complicated to understand. I would love to build an easy version of this. I actually have it working from a code algorithm stand point but no UI for it. Hope that helps clarify.\nSolution: Explained how to access resistance mode and limitations on customization.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thank you very much for taking the time to answer. everything is clear, just a tip for the last point, it would be a great feature that once you upload an activity course the app would set the resistance based on the course, for example 30km flat and then 5km ascend with 5% gradient. Don\u2019t know if i made myself clear. thank you very much. the app is great anyway\nContext: User appreciates the response and suggests a feature.\nUser Problem: Desire for automatic resistance adjustment based on uploaded courses.\nAnswer: Thanks, yes you can do this with our app now. So it works fine for slopes. But converting to ERG and automatic power control is something else. Setting specific ERG values you can pedal on the flat at 100w or at 130w depending on how you feel. image2354\u00d71408 321 KB So slope mode is popular for some of our users.

Most of the time that have to browse and plan workouts is when I\u2019m not at a PC. The workout editor that is second to none from a computer is difficult to navigate from a phone.

That could almost be a setting in the app. \u201cAdd Slopes to workouts without slopes.\u201d We have some automatic conversion but I am not sure if that would work for you. Lengths of reps and rests might fit into my design idea.\nSolution: Consideration of adding a setting for slopes in the app.\n\nQ&A 6:\nQuestion: That\u2019s an interesting idea on automatic slopes. Since trainers, preferred cadence, and abilities vary, perhaps you could add an option to associate certain slopes with % of FTP (like w/power and HR zones). That can be done on the website (since it\u2019s a one-time thing), and then on the phone app there could be a toggle to use these default \u201cslope zone\u201d settings based on % of FTP, or to override those and use the slope specified in the workout if available (or set manually if not). For either scenario, the user could still use the slider to fine tune on the fly, but it would be convenient to be able to predetermine the slope to associate with a given power level.\nUser Problem: Need for customizable slope settings based on FTP.\nAnswer: That is a very interesting idea. Even when desiging a workout you could just enter slopes and automatically get % of FTP base on your own conversions. I will have to think on this more.\nSolution: Acknowledgment of the idea and consideration for future design.",

Current Situation: When completing a workout synced from TrainerDay, the Strava upload often lacks detailed information about the workout itself. It would be incredibly helpful to have TrainerDay automatically populate the Strava description with the following: Workout Name: The exact name of the workout from the training plan. TrainerDay Link: A direct link to the workout within TrainerDay for easy reference. Workout Details: A text summary of the workout structure (e.g., intervals, targets, etc.). Benefits: Improved Strava Logs: Makes Strava activity logs far more informative and useful for analysis. Workout Showcase: Easily share the specifics of your training plan workouts with your Strava followers. Seamless Experience: Eliminates the need to manually edit Strava descriptions after each workout. Additional Considerations: Configurability: Make this an optional feature that users can enable/disable in their settings. Customization: Allow users to choose which details (name, link, full structure) are included in the Strava description. Example: Instead of a Strava description that just says \u201cMorning Ride,\u201d it could look like this: \"Sweet Spot Intervals - TrainerDay [Link to TrainerDay Workout] Warm-up 10 min 3 x 10 min Sweet Spot (90-95% FTP) 3 min rest between intervals Cool-down 10 min\"\nUser Problem: Strava upload often lacks detailed information about the workout itself.\nAnswer: Oh yes, I forgot to respond to this. What a great idea. We will do this for sure. Meaning at least have a flag that people can turn on components of this that that want. If it is not done in our app it seems likely that someone will do a different workout and we could mis-identify it, but still I think in 90%+ of cases we would get it right especially if the person does something similar to planned.\nSolution: We will implement a flag for users to turn on components of this feature.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I\u2019d love the ability to flag what gets written in description when syncing to Strava.

VO2 max #8 MS is 3:00 at 115% and 2 min recovery. Threshold #8 is 4:00 at 100% and 4 min of recovery. I find this a bit inconsistent, since I would rather make it vice versa, VO2 interval clearly requires more time to recover. I edit workouts in TP but just in case this may be smth to look into. Thanks much!\nUser Problem: Inconsistency in recovery times for VO2 max vs. Threshold intervals.\nAnswer: So, because VO2max has a heavy anaerobic contribution it means that W\u2019 comes into play here especially when talking about 28 minutes. IF is more related to aerobic capacity. So for some with a strong W\u2019 it might be hard and for others it might be impossible. I assume you are talking about VO2max crunched from the custom option and you may have turned up the intensity slider on your plan? In this case it is possible to create workouts that will be impossible for some people (me). You can see from a W\u2019 perspective it should be doable for someone with 200/13 image2070\u00d71166 185 KB This is #18, this is seriously ugly but still theoretically possible. image918\u00d7738 41.2 KB I really think when doing workouts > threshold it\u2019s important to implement some RPE in that in the sense, just scale back a little if it is too much. My beliefs are in this video I will double check with Andrea and see what he thinks once you confirm exactly what workouts you are doing. Send me a link to your plan or calendar.\nSolution: Consider scaling back intensity if workouts are too hard.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Could you pls share some explanation of how to understand this red line?\nContext: Referring to a workout data visualization.\nUser Problem: Understanding the meaning of the red line in workout data.\nAnswer: Ok so you are just a bad ass So if you have more of time trial physiology vs sprinter then it would be much harder for you then someone with a sprinter profile. Search our blog, I have about 3 articles explaining how W\u2019 works. CP is generally your best 20 minutes, or 1.05 X FTP. Here is one example article but others explain it a bit better. I need to do a video on this. AWC and W\u2019 are the same thing. https://blog.trainerday.com/how-to-determine-your-w-missing-calculator-17967294a1e4 Generally as the red line gets closer to the bottom it gets very hard. The red line is W\u2019Bal meaning the balance of what is left (theoretically) in your gas AWC or W\u2019 tank. Something like below with repeats of digging deep is even harder than hitting absolute 0 (the bottom) one time.\nSolution: Provided a link to articles explaining W\u2019 and the red line.",

It\u2019s use would be mostly during a ramp test, where after failure I\u2019d like to continue the workout at a recovery effort and track (for example) heart rate recovery.

Check this workout Trainer Day - Activity Detail After 1 hour of HR based training, it does auto extend for 5 minutes. But as you can see : the power drops totally. I started playing around with the settings (moving to ERG, changing the target HR). As you can see, I got the \u201ctarget\u201d back up. But : at the next extension to 5 minutes, all power dropped again. Something is wrong here I\u2019m afraid \u2026\nContext: Referring to a specific workout and version of the app.\nUser Problem: Power drops during auto-extend after HR training.\nAnswer: The first one, might be a new bug that fixed something else\u2026 We will look at this, thanks. That other one I think is some really random bug that happened before, we can\u2019t figure out how to repeat it but your steps look like something.\nSolution: Acknowledgment of the bug and assurance of investigation.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s another bug with this version. Check out this workout Trainer Day - Activity Detail Around 12:20 into the session, I added an ERG based block. When I did that in the previous version, nothing happened, the ERG block was added at the end. I know I had to \u201cmanually\u201d switch to ERG when the time was there. What happened now is, the power dropped as soon as the ERG block was added (around 12:24). It actually dropped to the ERG level active at the time.\nContext: Describing a specific issue with ERG block addition.\nUser Problem: Power drops when adding an ERG block mid-workout.\nAnswer: So you should show me the second workout that you merged with the first one. If it has \u201cERG\u201d as the type of the first segment it will auto switch. But I think you are talking about something else. See below, these will auto switch from ERG to HR and back.\nSolution: Clarification on how ERG blocks work and request for more information.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Not wanting to go off track, but when you say you \u201cadded an ERG block\u201d mid workout, is that opening another workout and merging it? I haven\u2019t tried that yet, and it sounds useful.\nContext: Seeking clarification on functionality.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about merging workouts mid-session.\nAnswer: You can definitely do that. Mid workout you can merge in any other workout. You can create groups of blocks to create workouts on the fly. I was not clearly understanding what he meant though.\nSolution: Confirmation that merging workouts mid-session is possible.",

        "text": "Forum Q&A: Define Period for Pre-Adjusting ERG Interval Power\nCategory: Feature Requests\nTopic Type: Feature Requests\n\nQ&A 1:\nQuestion: It would be a very useful addition to allow the setting of a period in seconds for pre-adjusting the Power for an ERG period. This is particularly beneficial for trainers where the time taken to adjust Power takes time. Whilst it is possible to manually edit workouts to do this, obviously this is tedious if taking advantage of Trainer Day workout library. Ideally the option would allow; Adjust Resistance (seconds) Pre-Adjust (Yes/No) when Next Interval is higher (i.e. prevent trainer reducing before end of interval)\nUser Problem: The time taken to adjust Power for an ERG period.\nAnswer: This is an interesting idea. I assume you mean in ERG mode so right now we send an target update to the trainer 2 seconds before the desired interval change. We know some trainers are slower than this. I am not fully understanding what you are asking for. Meaning we always see this being consistent so if the interval starts 3 seconds late and finishes 3 seconds late this is not such a problem. Can you describe better or show a visual example?\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: As I understand, this is exactly what @zymurgy meant. The aim is to have correct power at the right moment, so if you know your trainer is 2 s sluggish, then you set it as 2 s and you will get the right power when your VO2 interval starts, not 2 s later.\nUser Problem: Getting correct power at the right moment.\nAnswer: Hey good to see you. Ok yes, I understand this and like this. I would just set a single value because I believe in most case the delay should stay mostly consistent. I think this should not be difficult. I will put this fairly high in the priority list.\nSolution: Set a single value for delay.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: The issue on trainers like Stages SB20 is more the time it takes to get to target power rather than reducing. Obviously this is more of an issue on shorter duration intervals. So I found a 2 or 3 second period to pre-adjust would work well and would mean the time at target power was closer to the interval duration.\nContext: Discussing the performance of the Stages SB20 trainer.\nUser Problem: Time taken to reach target power.\nAnswer: Oh I see, thanks for explaining, I will think about how hard it is to do it automatically vs settings. If we do it automatically we will take this into account and check both up and down times.\nSolution: Consider automatic adjustment based on trainer performance.",

Is there such an option in CJ?\nContext: Tom is currently doing a peak block and is preparing for alpine passes.\nUser Problem: The suggested VO2max sessions are too short and intense.\nAnswer: We have these custom progressions, you may have seen, but we don\u2019t have one like that.

We just started our final \u2018peak\u2019 block using the big climbs option. We spent quite a bit of time getting our configurations perfectly mirrored to ensure we were doing exactly the same workouts on the same schedule. This week we\u2019ve noticed that parts of the dynamic force and threshold workouts differ - I seem to have lots of over / unders after the main work intervals and he seems to have longer threshold / tempo intervals. The work intervals also seem slightly different in length. We are due to ride 90min threshold and dynamic force #9 this week. I would prefer my workouts to include the longer intervals at the end Vs the over unders. Any advice or support you can offer would be greatly appreciated! Also - thanks for building an awesome product at an affordable price point. Chapeau!\nContext: Training for a big event in July using Coach Jack.\nUser Problem: Differences in workout configurations despite mirroring settings.\nAnswer: So what you can do, to make 100% sure they are the same is go to Coach Jack, click save and send to my plans. Once in my plans on the plan details plan you can share a link to your specific plan with your friend (or visa versa), then he can clone that plan to his plans and send it to his calendar. Each plan is dynamically built for the person so they are all a bit different. You can click edit on one of your plans and keep tweaking the dials and you will see the secondary work will change. But if you like his plan, then just use his. image1072\u00d7560 54.7 KB\nSolution: Share a link to your specific plan with your friend to ensure both are using the same workout.",

Thanks,\nContext: User is interested in importing routes from Strava and using slope data for workouts.\nUser Problem: Need for slope representation in workouts without power targets.\nAnswer: That should work, just a pure route without power. The only problem is we just convert slopes to power targets so visually what you see in our app is not for example the likely pacing strategy you would use for best performance. A complex but best solution is best bike split. That\u2019s what serious TT racers do. But you can follow slopes.

But since Garmin removed the option for slope workouts I was a bit lost. Pleased to see that TrainerDay supports this and I agree that it is very quick and easy to create workouts. As the title suggests I tend to use Slope to define the workout. It would be handy to be able to define the slope in a sets/reps workout. At the moment I need to switch between sets/reps and \u201cslope & hr\u201d views to input the slope data. A small inconvenience but I thought I would mention it, in case this was not intentional on your part. As I have quite a lot of variations of workouts I\u2019d planned to use Excel to create the tables. I noticed that I had to add a few empty columns into the Excel sheet to make the Excel data align correctly in the TrainerDay table. Again, a small problem but mentioned in case others use Excel to build the data. I saw other posts mention using Excel to calculate slope based on power/cadence. Steve\nContext: Steve is transitioning from TACX's app and is trying to adapt to TrainerDay's features.\nUser Problem: Need to switch between sets/reps and slope & hr views to input slope data.\nAnswer: Hi Steve, the problem is we don\u2019t have room at the moment for additional columns with sets and reps. That would be 2 more additional columns or some type of re-design. While I like it, sets and reps and slopes would be more of a rare use case from what I have seen.\nSolution: No immediate solution; acknowledged the limitation of current design.",

Screenshot 2023-07-16 at 2.09.14 PM2712\u00d71784 345 KB The Workout Graphic is correct showing, for eg: 10m @ Z2 (65%) [65% of 200w = 123w)] However the description below graphic shows 10m @65% (65w) Note: Workout Intervals is correct when pulling from the API. (it shows 65% and is percentOfFtp) tx\nContext: Testing workout creator functionality with specific FTP settings.\nUser Problem: Mismatch between workout graphic and description.\nAnswer: Thanks so much for reporting this. My dev says it is fixed. I did not verify though.\nSolution: The issue has been fixed by the development team.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Seems like this is also affecting the \u201csets and reps\u201d. But should be a small matter as this doesn\u2019t affect the actual interval power %.\nContext: Further testing revealed another potential issue.\nUser Problem: Concern about the impact on 'sets and reps'.\nAnswer: Thanks so much for reporting this. My dev says it is fixed. I did not verify though.\nSolution: The issue has been fixed by the development team.",
