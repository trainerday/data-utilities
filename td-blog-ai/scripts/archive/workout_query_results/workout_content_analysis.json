This is particularly beneficial for trainers where the time taken to adjust Power takes time. Whilst it is possible to manually edit workouts to do this, obviously this is tedious if taking advantage of Trainer Day workout library. Ideally the option would allow; Adjust Resistance (seconds) Pre-Adjust (Yes/No) when Next Interval is higher (i.e. prevent trainer reducing before end of interval)\nUser Problem: The time taken to adjust Power for an ERG period.\nAnswer: This is an interesting idea. I assume you mean in ERG mode so right now we send an target update to the trainer 2 seconds before the desired interval change. We know some trainers are slower than this.

VO2 max #8 MS is 3:00 at 115% and 2 min recovery. Threshold #8 is 4:00 at 100% and 4 min of recovery. I find this a bit inconsistent, since I would rather make it vice versa, VO2 interval clearly requires more time to recover. I edit workouts in TP but just in case this may be smth to look into. Thanks much!\nUser Problem: Inconsistency in recovery times for VO2 max vs. Threshold intervals.\nAnswer: So, because VO2max has a heavy anaerobic contribution it means that W\u2019 comes into play here especially when talking about 28 minutes. IF is more related to aerobic capacity. So for some with a strong W\u2019 it might be hard and for others it might be impossible. I assume you are talking about VO2max crunched from the custom option and you may have turned up the intensity slider on y",

Current Situation: When completing a workout synced from TrainerDay, the Strava upload often lacks detailed information about the workout itself. It would be incredibly helpful to have TrainerDay automatically populate the Strava description with the following: Workout Name: The exact name of the workout from the training plan. TrainerDay Link: A direct link to the workout within TrainerDay for easy reference. Workout Details: A text summary of the workout structure (e.g., intervals, targets, etc.).
