# Integration with Other Platforms

### Integration with Other Platforms

At TrainerDay, we're all about flexibility and making your training as seamless and integrated as possible. We understand that everyone has their preferred platforms and gadgets, and we're here to make sure TrainerDay works harmoniously with them. Whether you're a Zwift enthusiast, a Strava segment hunter, or a TrainingPeaks data geek, we've got you covered. Let's dive into how TrainerDay plays well with others.

#### Bringing TrainerDay Workouts to Zwift

If you're a Zwift rider who loves spicing up your virtual rides with structured workouts, TrainerDay has got your back. Our platform allows you to download ZWO files for Zwift, complete with interval comments to keep you motivated and informed throughout your session. Here's a quick guide:

1. **Find Your Workout**: Search through our vast library for the workout that fits your training plan.
2. **Download a ZWO File**: Once you've found your workout, download the ZWO file directly from TrainerDay.
3. **Load It into Zwift**: Follow our video tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7Jq2TaJD_A) to see how you can get your TrainerDay workout into Zwift's workout folder.

This feature ensures your indoor training sessions are both challenging and engaging, with clear instructions guiding you through every interval.

#### Syncing with TrainingPeaks and Garmin

We believe in giving you a comprehensive view of your training plan, which is why TrainerDay's integration with TrainingPeaks and Garmin is so seamless. By connecting your TrainerDay account with TrainingPeaks, you unlock:

- **Detailed Analytics**: Get deeper insights into your workouts and performance.
- **Calendar Sync**: View your entire TrainingPeaks calendar within TrainerDay, ensuring you never miss a workout.
- **Workout of the Day Feature**: Access your TrainingPeaks workouts directly in TrainerDay for added convenience.

Moreover, our calendar can sync with Garmin devices and Google Calendar, making it easier to plan and adjust your training schedule on the go.

#### Importing Routes

For those who love outdoor rides but want to recreate them indoors, TrainerDay allows you to import routes from Strava rides, Garmin Connect activities, or any routes created using tools like RideWithGPS or Google Maps. While these imports provide simple power estimates rather than optimizing route performance, they're a fantastic way to relive your favorite rides or prepare for upcoming challenges.

#### Mixing and Matching Cycling Modes

While ERG mode is popular for its precision, we recognize it's not always the perfect fit for every workout, especially when it comes to short intervals or when you crave a more natural riding feel. That's why TrainerDay supports various training modes, allowing you to switch between ERG, slope, and free-ride modes depending on your workout's needs and your personal preference.

#### Free Ride and Open-Ended Intervals

TrainerDay also supports open-ended intervals for Garmin devices, ideal for when you want the freedom to decide how long an effort lasts in the moment. Simply add "fr" or "free-ride" to the interval type in our editor, and you're set for a workout that's as flexible as you need it to be.

#### Conclusion

In a nutshell, TrainerDay's integration capabilities are designed to make your training as connected and personalized as possible. By supporting seamless transitions between platforms like Zwift, TrainingPeaks, Garmin, and more, we ensure your training data is always at your fingertips, and your workouts are always aligned with your goals. Remember, if you want to make it harder, easier, longer, or shorter, you surely can. It's all about making training work for you, and at TrainerDay, we believe in providing the tools to do just that.
