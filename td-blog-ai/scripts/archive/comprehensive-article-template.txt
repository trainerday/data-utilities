IMPORTANT: Some bad facts indicate terminology changes. For example:

- No marketing fluff or hype - just clear, instructional content
- Use actual quotes from blog articles and user discussions where relevant

ALEX'S WRITING STYLE EXAMPLE:
From "The Benefits of a Polarized Approach to Cycling Training":

"Cycling is as much a mental game as it is a physical one. High-intensity intervals push cyclists to their limits and demand mental resilience. If you love hard intervals then sure jump right in, but we believe a slow build up to these longer sessions of hard intervals will produce great results and are a smarter, safer way to train."

"The Coach Jack Plan builder in TrainerDay is not exactly the same as traditional polarized training but embraces a process of starting easy and slowly working towards much harder workouts all while maintaining a mostly easy approach to training. Just like Dr Seiler suggests, your average season with coach Jack will likely be closer to 90/10 for time in zone if you take his base recommendations. If you want to make it harder you surely can."

Note Alex's style:
- Direct and conversational ("If you love hard intervals then sure jump right in")
- Uses "we believe" when sharing TrainerDay's philosophy
- Practical and instructional without being overly formal
- Acknowledges user preferences ("If you want to make it harder you surely can")
- Connects features to real training concepts naturally

ARTICLE STRUCTURE:
Organize the article based on the content provided. Create logical sections that cover:
- Introduction - Overview of TrainerDay's workout creation capabilities
- Major features found in the knowledge base (organize by importance/frequency)
- How-to sections for common tasks
- Advanced features and capabilities
- Common issues and solutions from user reports
- Tips and best practices from user experiences
- Conclusion that ties everything together

Create as many sections as needed to cover ALL the content comprehensively. Don't limit yourself to a predefined structure - adapt based on what information is available.

For each feature section:
- Start with what the feature does (from blog/facts)
- Include how users actually use it (from forums)
- Note any known issues or limitations (from user reports)
- Provide practical examples where available

TONE GUIDELINES:
- Be direct and helpful
- Acknowledge when features have quirks or limitations
- Use "I've seen users..." or "Users report..." for forum content
- Keep it practical and focused on actual usage

IMPORTANT: Generate a comprehensive article that serves as a complete reference guide for workout creation and management in TrainerDay, using ONLY the provided content. 

LENGTH REQUIREMENT: Write a COMPLETE article of 5,000-10,000 words. Do NOT stop early or cut off the article. Include ALL features mentioned in the content above. Cover every major topic comprehensively:
- Workout creation (editor, sets/reps, modes)
- W' (W-prime) and W'bal features in detail
- Calendar and planning features
- Integration with other platforms
- Advanced features and tips
- Common issues and solutions


NO FLUFF: While being comprehensive, do not add marketing language, hype, or repetitive content just to reach word count. Every sentence should provide instructional value or important context. Focus on being thorough with actual feature documentation, not verbose.

COMPLETION: Write the ENTIRE article in one response. Do not indicate that you'll continue in another part. Complete all sections fully.

IMPORTANT: Do not ask questions or seek permission - just write the complete article now. Generate the full 5,000-10,000 word article without stopping.
