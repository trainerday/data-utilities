# W' and W'bal Features

### W' and W'bal Features in TrainerDay

#### How to Determine Your W'

1. Conduct two tests to find your W':
   - Ride as hard as you can for approximately 3 minutes. If possible, extend this effort beyond 3 minutes.
   - Complete an 8 to 20-minute max effort test. Alternatively, if you know your FTP, you can enter it and use a 40-minute effort as a reference.
2. Input these values into the TrainerDay W' calculator available at [TrainerDay W' Calculator](https://trainerday.com/w-prime-calculator/).

#### Integrating W'bal into Workout Creation

1. Access the workout creator in TrainerDay.
2. Ensure your FTP (Functional Threshold Power) is accurately entered in your profile settings. This is crucial for accurate W'bal calculations.
3. Begin designing your workout by adding intervals. For example, to create a workout based on the provided content, you might add intervals at 120% FTP for 1 minute, followed by 2 minutes of recovery at 50% FTP.
4. To view the W'bal calculations, look for the W'bal toggle or indicator in the workout creator. If it's not visible or not working:
   - Check to ensure you're in the correct editing mode that supports W'bal visualization.
   - If issues persist, refer to the TrainerDay forums or support for troubleshooting, as some users have reported problems with W'bal not displaying correctly.

#### Understanding W'bal in Workout Design

- W'bal, or Work Balance, is a measure of your anaerobic work capacity over time. As you perform work above your Critical Power (CP) or FTP, your W'bal decreases. Recovery periods allow your W'bal to recover.
- When designing workouts, use W'bal to ensure the workout is challenging yet achievable. For instance, if your W' has been determined to be 20kJ and your FTP is 200W, designing intervals that exhaust this W' balance ensures the workout pushes your limits without being impossible to complete.
- Consider the impact of FTP on W'bal. A workout that is achievable for an athlete with a 200W FTP might not be feasible for someone with a 300W FTP due to the differences in W'bal depletion rates.

#### Troubleshooting Common W'bal Issues

- If W'bal calculations do not seem to reflect your efforts accurately, double-check that your FTP and W' values are correctly entered in TrainerDay. Incorrect values can lead to misleading W'bal readings.
- Users have reported occasional glitches with W'bal not displaying in the workout editor. If this occurs:
   1. Refresh the page or restart the workout creator.
   2. Toggle the W'bal feature off and on again.
   3. If problems persist, document the issue and contact TrainerDay support for assistance.

#### Utilizing W'bal in Training

- Use W'bal as a guide to design workouts that accurately target your anaerobic capacity. By monitoring W'bal, you can create intervals that challenge your anaerobic system without leading to premature fatigue.
- For example, designing a workout with intervals that gradually deplete your W' to near zero by the end of the session can maximize training effectiveness while ensuring complete recovery is possible.

By following these steps and considerations, TrainerDay users can effectively integrate W' and W'bal into their workout design and execution, leading to more personalized and effective training sessions.
