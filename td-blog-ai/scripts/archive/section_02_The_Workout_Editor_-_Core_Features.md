# The Workout Editor - Core Features

Hey there, fellow fitness enthusiasts! Let's dive into the core features of the Workout Editor on TrainerDay, and trust me, it's a game-changer for your training routine. Whether you're new to TrainerDay or looking to get more out of your workouts, this guide has got you covered.

### The Visual Workout Editor: Your Creative Playground

First off, the visual workout editor is a powerhouse, allowing you to tweak existing workouts or craft new ones from scratch. It's like having a personal trainer in your pocket, but with you calling the shots on what the workout looks like. If you love hard intervals, then, by all means, jump right in and create a session that pushes your limits. Or, if you're in the mood for something a bit more laid-back, you can adjust accordingly. The beauty of TrainerDay is that it's all about what YOU want.

### Two Methods, Double the Fun

When it comes to creating workouts, you've got two methods at your disposal: the grid-based system and the "Sets and Reps editor." If you're someone who loves structure and detail, the grid-based system will feel like home. It's similar to working on an Excel spreadsheet, where you can input workout data row by row, fine-tuning every aspect of your session.

On the other hand, the "Sets and Reps editor" is perfect for those who prefer a more streamlined approach. Ideal for complex interval workouts, this feature allows you to input the number of repetitions, duration, intensity for each rep, and rest periods with just a few clicks. It's designed to handle the nitty-gritty of interval training, making your life easier.

### Spreadsheet Integration: For the Data Wizards

We believe in making your training as personalized and efficient as possible. That's why the visual editor can be integrated with spreadsheet tools for those who love diving into more complex programming or need to make bulk modifications. This feature is a lifesaver for coaches or athletes who manage multiple workouts at a time.

### Editing on the Fly

Ever found a workout that's almost perfect but just needs a few tweaks? With the TrainerDay workout editor, you can edit target BPM values directly or clone existing workouts to modify them to your heart's content. It's about giving you the flexibility to make any workout your own.

### Interval Comments and More

Adding interval comments during the workout creation process is a small but mighty feature. It allows you to remind yourself of the focus of each interval or to add motivational notes. Plus, with the ability to share individual workouts by copying the URL from the browser, you can easily spread the fitness love with friends or clients.

### On-Screen Metrics for Real-Time Feedback

Once you're in the thick of it, the training screen on the TrainerDay app keeps you informed with various metrics, including speed, distance, power, heart rate, and cadence data. It's all about giving you the feedback you need to adjust your effort in real-time and crush your training goals.

### A World of Interval Types

The workout editor doesn't hold back when it comes to interval variety, offering 12 different types: warm-up, cooldown, hr, erg, slope, rest, open-ended, climb, active, interval, free-ride, and sfr. This array ensures you can design any workout imaginable, tailored precisely to your training needs.

### Practical Tips and User Experiences

Many of our users have found that playing around with different interval types and structures can lead to significant improvements in their training. For example, switching from ERG to slope mode for short intervals can make those sessions more manageable and effective. And remember, if you want to make it harder, you surely can. It's all about finding what works best for you and having the tools at your fingertips to implement it.

To sum it up, the TrainerDay Workout Editor is a robust, user-friendly platform designed to make your training as efficient and enjoyable as possible. Whether you're a data geek who loves diving into spreadsheets or someone who wants a quick and easy way to adjust your workouts, we've got you covered. Dive in, experiment, and discover how you can take your training to the next level with TrainerDay.
