This is a very simple import process, if your route has power it will show you the same targets you have. If it does not have power it will give simple power estimates but this is not made for optimizing route performance. It also shows the same slopes.

### Programmable Slope Mode — A New Way to Train

Creating and riding slope based workouts is fun and new. You can only do smart slopes in our training app. Smart slope workouts are especially perfect for short-intervals. On many smart-trainers ERG mode is not good for short- intervals. I think all trainers are bad for 5-second intervals in ERG mode. Science has shown that very short intervals can be a great minimalistic method of training.

As most of you likely know, one of the key fundamentals of exercise is progressive overload. This means if you want to get stronger you need to go to failure or at least close to failure to tell your body it needs to repair itself and get stronger so next time this same exercise is easy.

In cycling, aerobic power, measured by FTP, is not optional, it’s what gets you in the game. But if you want to excel in MTB, cyclo-cross, or find yourself periodically get dropped in sprints with your buddies, you might need to build your anaerobic power.

FTP, i.e. Functional Threshold Power, has become the most common term in performance cycling. It is great to have a single term to represent your cycling..."

Creating and riding slope based workouts is fun and new. You can only do smart slopes in our training app. Smart slope workouts are especially perfect for short-intervals.

"However, you won’t typically be able to adjust the resistance during your ride; rather, you’ll set the resistance at the beginning of your ride when you tighten the drum onto your rear tire.

Thus, in order to make your ride harder or easier — such as during a set of intervals — you can shift gears, just as you would on a flat road outside.   
Dumb trainers are significantly cheaper than smart trainers, but they are much less capable. These indoor trainers don’t measure power on their own, and y..."

- Apply similar logic to any other terminology corrections mentioned in the bad facts above.

- Reference specific blog articles or discussions when relevant
- Keep technical details accurate to what's documented

ALEX'S WRITING STYLE EXAMPLE:
From "The Benefits of a Polarized Approach to Cycling Training":

"Cycling is as much a mental game as it is a physical one. High-intensity intervals push cyclists to their limits and demand mental resilience. If you love hard intervals then sure jump right in, but we believe a slow build up to these longer sessions of hard intervals will produce great results and are a smarter, safer way to train."

"The Coach Jack Plan builder in TrainerDay is not exactly the same as traditional polarized training but embraces a process of starting easy and slowly working towards much harder workouts all while maintaining a mostly easy approach to training. Just like Dr Seiler suggests, your average season with coach Jack will likely be closer to 90/10 for time in zone if you take his base recommendations. If you want to make it harder you surely can."

Note Alex's style:
- Direct and conversational ("If you love hard intervals then sure jump right in")
- Uses "we believe" when sharing TrainerDay's philosophy
- Practical and instructional without being overly formal
- Acknowledges user preferences ("If you want to make it harder you surely can")
- Connects features to real training concepts naturally
