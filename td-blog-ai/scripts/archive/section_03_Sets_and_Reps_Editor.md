**Exploring the Magic of Sets and Reps Editor in TrainerDay**

Hey there! If you're like me and you've been diving into the world of indoor training, you're always on the lookout for tools that make creating those grueling workouts a bit simpler. That's where TrainerDay's Sets and Reps Editor shines. Whether you're all about those hard intervals or you're crafting a structured training plan, this feature is a game-changer. Let's dive deep and see what makes it tick.

### What's the Big Deal with Sets and Reps Editor?

First off, the Sets and Reps Editor is one of two ways you can create workouts in TrainerDay, sitting proudly alongside the grid-based system. But if you're looking to build complex workouts with ease, this is your go-to tool. Imagine setting up an entire block of workout with just a few clicks - that's the power we're talking about here.

### The Nuts and Bolts

At its core, the Sets and Reps editor allows you to input the nitty-gritty details of your workout: the number of repetitions, duration, intensity for each rep, and those oh-so-important rest periods. It's designed to handle complex interval workouts with grace. If you're planning a session with repeated intervals, you can set up the pattern once and specify how many times you want it to repeat. Talk about a time saver!

### Making It Your Own

We believe in flexibility and personalization here at TrainerDay. That's why the Sets and Reps Editor is built to cater to your training needs. Want to add comments for cadence guidance or specific instructions for outdoor workouts? No problem. The Editor has you covered. And if you're midway through an interval and feeling like you can push a bit more, you can easily extend intervals in 10-second or 30-second increments. If you're into heart-rate-based training, the Editor supports HR-based intervals too, allowing the app to adjust the power target to keep you in your desired HR zone.

### Beyond the Basics

Now, let's get a bit technical but in a fun way. The Sets and Reps Editor isn't just about setting up intervals; it's about crafting workouts that fit perfectly with your training philosophy. For those who love digging into the details, the Editor can be integrated with spreadsheet tools for bulk modifications or more complex programming. And for the tech-savvy, raw watts, FTP %, bpm, and slope % can all be used to create those intervals.

### A Real-World Example

Imagine you're planning a workout with 5 sets of 2-minute intervals at 120% FTP with 2 minutes of rest in between. Instead of manually inputting each interval, with the Sets and Reps Editor, you set up one interval and specify it repeats five times. Add your rest period, and voila, your workout is ready faster than you can fill your water bottle.

### On-The-Fly Adjustments

We get it, sometimes you're in the zone, and you want to push harder or longer. TrainerDay's app allows you to modify workout duration on the fly. Just hit the + button to add time in increments during active intervals. It's all about giving you control over your training, without overcomplicating things.

### Syncing with Your World

Your workouts don't live in a vacuum. That's why the library can sync with connected services like Intervals.icu, making it easier to track your progress and analyze your efforts. It's all about creating a seamless training experience, from planning to execution to analysis.
