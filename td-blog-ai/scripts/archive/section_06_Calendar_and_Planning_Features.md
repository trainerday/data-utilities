# Calendar and Planning Features

Hey there! Let's dive into the world of TrainerDay and explore how its calendar and planning features can revolutionize the way you train. Whether you're the kind of cyclist who loves grinding through hard intervals or someone who prefers a more laid-back approach, TrainerDay's got you covered. And hey, if you want to dial up the intensity, you surely can. Let's get into it.

### Importing Routes Made Easy

First off, for those who love mixing virtual training with real-world rides, TrainerDay allows you to import routes from Strava rides, Garmin Connect activities, and other tools like RideWithGPS or Google Maps. Imagine riding your favorite outdoor route from the comfort of your home. If your route has power data, TrainerDay will show you those targets. If not, it'll give you simple power estimates. Though it's not about optimizing route performance, it's pretty cool to ride your own routes virtually with estimated power targets.

### Organizing Your Workouts

We understand that staying organized is key to efficient training. That's why TrainerDay uses tags alongside lists, plans, and the calendar to help keep your workout library tidy. Whether it's tagging workouts based on intensity, duration, or how much they make you want to cry (kiddingâ€¦ or am I?), tags are super handy in keeping things organized.

### Syncing with Your World

Now, let's talk about syncing, because we know your training doesn't exist in a bubble. TrainerDay's library can sync with services like Intervals.icu, which is fantastic for tracking your progress and analyzing your workouts. And for those who love the detailed analytics of TrainingPeaks, TrainerDay integrates with it too, giving you access to all those juicy details about your training.

### My Calendar: Your Training Command Center

The heart of TrainerDay's planning features is the "My Calendar" feature. It's where all the magic happens. You can add any plan to your calendar and then move workouts around, skip days, or adjust timing based on your actual schedule. Flexibility is key here; we know life happens, and your training needs to adapt. And yes, this calendar syncs with Garmin devices, TrainingPeaks, and Google Calendar, so your training plan can live harmoniously with your work meetings and family events.

### Seeing Your TrainingPeaks Workouts

For those using TrainingPeaks, TrainerDay makes life easier. You can see your entire TrainingPeaks calendar within TrainerDay, thanks to the Calendar Sync option. Plus, with the Workout of the Day (WOD) feature, accessing your TrainingPeaks workouts in TrainerDay is a breeze. It's all about making your training as seamless as possible.

### Practical Tips and Tricks

- **Importing Routes**: Don't be afraid to get creative with your routes. Importing is simple, and riding familiar routes can be a motivational boost.
- **Using Tags**: Start with a few broad tags and refine as you go. You might be surprised how a well-tagged workout library can simplify your training.
- **Syncing Services**: Take advantage of the syncing options. If you're using TrainingPeaks or Intervals.icu, syncing with TrainerDay can give you a more comprehensive view of your training.

### User Experiences

Many of our users love the flexibility the "Send to My Calendar" option provides. Being able to move a workout because a surprise meeting popped up or you just need an extra rest day has been a game-changer for many. And for those who geek out on data, the integration with TrainingPeaks has made training analysis that much easier.
