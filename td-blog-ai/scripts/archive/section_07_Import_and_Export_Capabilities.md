# Import and Export Capabilities

Hey there! If you're eager to dive into the nitty-gritty of importing and exporting workouts and routes in TrainerDay, you've landed in the right spot. Whether you're looking to bring in a killer route you've conquered outdoors or share your own custom workout with the world, we've got you covered. Let's break it down, shall we?

## Importing: Bring the World Into TrainerDay

Starting with the basics, importing into TrainerDay is a breeze. Whether you've got a file ready to go or you're just starting, the process is super simple. Just drag and drop your file or browse to select it. This could be your favorite route from Strava rides, a memorable Garmin Connect activity, or even something you've crafted on RideWithGPS or Google Maps.

Why would you import a route, you ask? Well, it's all about simulating that specific terrain indoors. It's perfect for practicing climbs or just reliving a great ride. When you import a route, TrainerDay doesn't just give you a bland power target; oh no, we spice it up with both power targets and elevation profiles. Plus, if you're into the nitty-gritty, slope data from your route can be imported right into TrainerDay's workout creator for that extra layer of realism.

And for the Zwift enthusiasts out there, we haven't forgotten you. Interval comments are seamlessly integrated for ZWO file downloads, making your indoor experience as rich and engaging as possible.

## Exporting: Share Your Workouts with the World

Now, let's talk about sharing the love. TrainerDay allows you to export workouts to other platforms, letting your hard work benefit others. Whether it's a community workout in MRC format or a personalized workout from our library, you have a variety of formats at your disposal for use on other platforms.

Exporting workouts to Zwift? Piece of cake. Download the workout file and pop it into Zwift's workout folder. And yes, those handy interval comments come along for the ride, ensuring your Zwift experience is top-notch.

But why stop at Zwift? TrainerDay believes in a holistic approach to your training. We understand that each platform has its strengths, and we encourage you to mix and match to find what works best for you. After all, if you want to make it harder or easier, you surely can. It's all about finding what motivates you and pushes you towards your goals.

## Real User Tips and Experiences

Our community is at the heart of everything we do. That's why we're not just about the how-to's; we're about the why's and the what-if's. For instance, importing a route and tackling it in programmable slope mode is a game-changer for many of our users. It offers a fresh, engaging way to train, especially for those short, punchy intervals where ERG mode might not cut it.

We've also learned a lot from our users about mixing and matching cycling modes for indoor training. Even though we pride ourselves on being a go-to platform for ERG workouts, the truth is, variety is the spice of life (and training). Switching between modes, based on the workout or even how you're feeling that day, can make a significant difference in your overall training experience.

And let's not forget about those unique TrainerDay features like ramps in your workouts, free ride, and open-ended intervals for Garmin devices, and our approach to importing routes with power estimates. These are all about making your training as effective and enjoyable as possible.
