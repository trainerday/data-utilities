### Designed for one thing.¬†Speed.

That‚Äôs it. It works just like Excel with copy and paste and arrow keys for moving. Try it out. [https://app.trainerday.com](https://app.trainerday.com)

**Automatically switch from Slope to ERG or HR modes.**

In the above video you can see how to use our workout editor to switch modes automatically. HR mode controls your smart trainer by automatically adjusting your power to hit your target heart rate.

When you type in this field you can see all the possible values, but most don‚Äôt have much functionality connected with them.

## 3. INTERVAL COMMENTS
Blog Article: Learn About Interval Comments

#### For entertainment, education, and motivation

Available for ZWO file downloads for Zwift only. More systems are coming soon. See in the image, it shows you exactly where your comment will appear in the interval. We will plan on adding interval comments to other platforms. I know GoldenCheetah has also said they will support importing¬†.zwo files with interval comments soon.

If enough people request it we could add them to¬†.erg files for TrainerRoad. Next on the roadmap is adding them to our iOS and Android training apps.

If you want to delete a row, just clear the comment out and it will automatically be removed when you save it.

If you have any questions, just let us know. I will create a video showing it soon.

## 4. TRAINING MODES
Blog Article: Mixing And Matching Cycling Modes For Indoor Training

TrainerDay and other platforms have different modes for smart trainers and smart bikes. ERG is the most popular for workouts but even though we are the biggest ERG workout platform, we believe in a more wholistic approach. ERG is great for a specific purpose, but the other modes are great as well

The Four Modes of TrainerDay

**Mode 1‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäERG**

ERG is perfect for a few cases. One is when you just want to watch a movie or not think about the training itself but hit specific power targets. This is specially good for training in Zones 1 thru 4. It can also work reasonably well for Zone 5 with some adjustments. Most workouts are designed around your FTP but there is a [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|problem with workouts that are Zone 5 or higher.]]

Generally ERG is the main workhorse of indoor workouts. We believe training should be more dynamic based on how you feel, but ERG works well, you must might want to press the + or - buttons in our app at times. You don‚Äôt need to kill yourself on the days that just feel a bit off.

**Slope Mode**

Our app has slope mode which you can instantly switch to at the click of a button. You also can design workouts that automatically switch to slope mode with a specific slope angle (design your own hills).

![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1V3lIJfwpM6Ho4iv-r19e0Q.png)

Slope mode is great because you can use your gears and cadence to control your power output and you can decide how closely you want to hit your desired power targets for each interval. It‚Äôs just like Zwift but you can ride at a sustained specific slope as long as you want and more easily control your power output. ERG mode does not work well on short intervals, how short depends on the trainer you own but some where around 10‚Äì15 seconds are as short as works well in ERG mode, in that range it‚Äôs better to manually control your power with slope mode. [[2023-01-01-smart-slopes-779c74a0c921.md|Read more here]]

**Resistance Mode**

Resistance mode is like slope mode but instead up to a 25 degree slope (very rare to do 25%, 3‚Äì10% is more common) you specify resistance from 1‚Äì100%. The actual power output depends on cadence and your specific model of trainer. We do not have any automatic resistance mode but really slope and resistance are the same and slope mode is more standardly used. You can switch from allowing switching Slope mode to using Resistance mode in our Other Settings.

**Heart Rate‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäHR Mode**

Heart rate mode is a very specific mode that automatically controls your trainers power target (ERG mode) based on your target heart rate. If your heart rate is too high it will lower your power target and the opposite if it is too low. It moves very slowly giving your heart rate time to catch up. This works as a limit not an average. Meaning if you say 120 limit we try to keep it just under 120. Some people like ERG for the warmup and HR for some good Zone 2 HR based training.

You can see in this video you can design workouts that atomically switches in and out of any of these modes.

## 5. W'BAL AND ADVANCED FEATURES
Blog Article: W'bal Says Easy, I Say It's Impossible

#### Basically no one can do 60-minutes at¬†FTP

In theory, 60-minutes is possible, but in reality almost no one will unless their FTP is set too low. W‚ÄôBal shows that it is ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù That is because W‚ÄôBal is not about easy or hard. It only looks at what is above FTP (anaerobic) and sees if it it is possible. Don‚Äôt use W‚ÄôBal for anything close to or below your FTP. See below. The cutoff of when it get‚Äôs useful is individual but I would say somewhere around 115% of FTP and above. It‚Äôs generally good for VO2max and above. W‚Äô is not perfect, it‚Äôs just a starting point.
