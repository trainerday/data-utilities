# Sets and Reps Editor

### Sets and Reps Editor

The Sets and Reps Editor in TrainerDay is designed to facilitate the creation of complex interval workouts efficiently. Follow these steps to utilize this feature effectively:

#### Accessing the Sets and Reps Editor

1. Log in to your TrainerDay account.
2. Navigate to the "Workout Creator" section.
3. Choose the "Sets and Reps Editor" option from the available workout creation methods.

#### Creating a Workout

1. **Input Basic Workout Details:**
   - Enter a name for your workout.
   - Optionally, add a description and tags for easier categorization.

2. **Define Your Intervals:**
   - Click on the "Add Interval" button to start defining your workout structure.
   - For each interval, input the duration, intensity (you can use raw watts, FTP %, bpm, or slope %), and any rest periods. For example, enter "5 minutes at 120% FTP with 2 minutes rest."

3. **Repetitions:**
   - If your workout includes repeated intervals, specify the pattern once and then enter the number of repetitions. For instance, for 5 repetitions of the above interval, simply input "5" in the repetitions field.

4. **Adjusting Intervals:**
   - The editor may automatically adjust the number of reps or add extra lines if there's an overlap in interval interpretations. Review the automatically generated intervals for accuracy.

5. **Interval Comments:**
   - Use the interval comments section for additional instructions, such as cadence guidance or notes for outdoor workouts.

6. **Extending Intervals:**
   - During workout creation or active workouts, intervals can be extended in 10-second or 30-second increments using the "+" button.

7. **Heart Rate Mode:**
   - For HR-based intervals, set a target heart rate. The app will adjust the power target to keep you within this HR zone.

8. **Finalizing Your Workout:**
   - Once all intervals are defined, review your workout structure. Make any necessary adjustments to intervals, repetitions, and rest periods.

9. **Saving Your Workout:**
   - Click the "Save" button to store your workout. It will now be available in your library and can be synced with connected services like Intervals.icu.

#### Troubleshooting and Limitations

- **Overlap Adjustments:** The editor might change the number of reps or add extra lines if there's an overlap in interval interpretations. Always review the final workout structure for accuracy.
- **System Interpretation:** Users have reported instances where the editor's interpretation of interval structures did not match their intentions. Double-check the generated intervals for consistency with your planned workout.
- **Extension Limitations:** While the app allows for extending intervals, this feature is designed for on-the-fly adjustments and may not suit all workout structures.

By following these steps and considerations, you can leverage the Sets and Reps Editor in TrainerDay to create detailed and structured interval workouts tailored to your training needs.
