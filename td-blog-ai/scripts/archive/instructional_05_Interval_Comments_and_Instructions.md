# Interval Comments and Instructions

### Interval Comments and Instructions in TrainerDay

Interval comments in TrainerDay are designed to provide specific guidance or information at the beginning of each interval during a workout. These comments can be crucial for cadence guidance, outdoor workouts, and complex progressions. Follow the steps below to effectively add and manage interval comments in your TrainerDay workouts.

#### Adding Interval Comments

1. **Access the Workout Editor**: To add interval comments, start by opening the workout you wish to edit in the TrainerDay workout editor.
   
2. **Select an Interval**: Click on the specific interval where you want to add a comment.

3. **Enter the Comment**: In the interval details panel, locate the text box for comments. Here, you can type your specific instructions or guidance for that interval. For example, enter "Maintain 90 RPM" for cadence guidance.

4. **Adjust the Offset (Optional)**: The offset setting allows you to specify when the comment appears during the interval. By default, comments appear at the beginning of an interval. If you need the comment to appear at a specific time, enter the offset value in seconds. Note: Incorrect offset values can lead to comments not appearing as intended. It's reported that setting the offset to 0 might not be allowed, and a minimum of 1 second might be required.

5. **Save Your Workout**: After adding your comments, make sure to save your workout to apply the changes.

#### Tips for Effective Interval Comments

- **Clarity is Key**: Keep your comments concise and clear. Remember, the user will be in the middle of a workout and should be able to understand the instruction quickly.

- **Use for Key Instructions**: Utilize comments for crucial instructions or reminders, such as changes in cadence, posture reminders, or motivational notes.

- **Consider the Workout Platform**: If you're exporting workouts to platforms like Zwift (ZWO files), ensure your comments are compatible and check how they appear within these platforms.

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Comments Not Appearing**: If comments do not appear during a workout, check the offset value. An incorrect offset can cause comments to display at the wrong time or not at all. Ensure the offset is set correctly for your intended timing.

- **Duplicate Comments**: Ensure you're not accidentally adding the same comment to multiple intervals unless it's intended. Review your workout in the editor to confirm comments are placed correctly.

- **Exporting Issues**: When exporting workouts with comments, especially to third-party platforms like Zwift, verify that the comments appear as expected in the exported file. Some users have reported needing to adjust comments or offsets for compatibility.

#### Example

To add a comment instructing a user to increase their cadence at the start of the third interval in a workout:

1. Open the workout in the TrainerDay workout editor.
2. Click on the third interval.
3. In the comment box, type "Increase cadence to 95 RPM".
4. Leave the offset at its default setting if you want the comment to appear at the beginning of the interval.
5. Save the workout.

By following these steps and considerations, you can effectively use interval comments to enhance the workout experience in TrainerDay, providing clear, timely instructions to users.
