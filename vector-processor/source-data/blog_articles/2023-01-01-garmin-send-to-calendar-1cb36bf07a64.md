### Send to Garmin Calendar

Go to a workout and click Send To > Garmin you will see this popup. You must have a paid membership. The great advantage of sending directly to your Garmin calendar is you don’t have to go to Garmin connect app or site to push the workout to your device. It will now just show up on your device automatically. One less step!!!

If you don’t have a paid membership. Please help support us. That way we can keep building cool stuff.
