**LEARNING INTRODUCTION**  
This is the place to learn everything about TrainerDay and some overview of training and indoor trainers. Our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TrainerDay) and our [Forum](https://forums.trainerday.com/) are both good sources of info but there are also links to some videos and forum posts below. A few good book ideas below 🙂

*   **FAQ: Why don’t the workouts on my TrainingPeaks calendar show in the TD calendar?** This is not how it works. Calendar sync sends TD workouts to TP and the WOD feature shows workouts in our training app.  
    **FAQ: Why don’t the workouts on my Intervals Calendar show in the TD calendar?** This is not how it works. Calendar sync sends TD workouts to Intervals and the WOD feature shows workouts in our training app.
