It should take 60-seconds to do this :) Just go to our apps and devices page on our website and connect to TrainingPeaks and turn on WOD feature.

You will see just that last day or so and the up coming 4/5 days or so. Make sure you have something on your TrainingPeaks calendar in the next few days to see it in our app. It must be a structured workout. What I mean by that is it should look something like below in the TrainingPeaks calendar. This is a SwimErg workout but a cycling workout would be similar.
