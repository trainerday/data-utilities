2022/2023 are the year of multi-sport for TrainerDay. We have added Vasa SwimErg and RowErg to TrainerDay. This means swim and row workouts can be created and searched.

On our website go to profile settings

Enable Other Sports. If you are a single sport athlete, selecting only one will simplify your TrainerDay experirence.

Once you do that you will now have a filter available when you search.

After clicking the search icon you will see swim workouts in this example, then I suggest you add them to your calendar or you can create a new list for simple access in our app.

Then you can find them in your lists.

**Pro Tip:** If you want that list quickly available in our training app you can make an training app shortcut. See below.

Out Training App currently does not filter workouts by sport. You must organize your workouts in a way that you understand which are swim and which are other sports. Naming the list helps.

Good luck. Try it out now go to https://app.trainerday.com/
