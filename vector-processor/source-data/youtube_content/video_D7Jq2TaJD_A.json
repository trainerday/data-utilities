    "full_text": "okay Here I am on the ER gdb website and we've got over 3,000 swift workouts that you can download so when you want to try something new and challenging you can come here and find something to download anyway this is instructions on how to do that if you scroll down a little bit I see the latest workouts we've also got filters and search and and similar workouts there's a lot of different ways to find workouts here let's just say I want this one and I want to load this one as whipped I just come to this z wo file I click on download it it downloads there I go to my downloads folder which I've got open here and I can see that it downloaded there and then you just have to copy that into your swift folder you know I'm showing you on a Mac but basically a PC is an identical process that that the way you do this is just that the folder is just in a slightly different location which I'll share on this blog post but I've created a shortcut here so I'm going to hit ctrl C on that on this file I'm gonna go to the swift into the workouts folder this is my user ID I'm the only user using this so I can click on that and I hit paste now I've got a z wo folder or file in here and if I open up Swift it will be available in my workout so I'll go ahead and open Swift now this this happens to be on my home computer my desktop this is not the computer that I ride with Swift on or or the iOS device you can also do I OS device but once you loaded in Swift here it will actually synchronize across all your different iOS devices iOS and/or other computers so you could do this at work you can do this in your office you know you can do it wherever you want and then it will synchronize to your your other computer so I'll go ahead and open Swift here you know here let's go it actually takes a while for a swift to load so I'm gonna go ahead and pause pause this video right now and we'll come back when it's whipped loads okay here we are and we're back to Swift I don't you can see I don't have any bike connected to it so I'll go ahead and just click just watch okay here we are we're watching now if I click back to me here it gives me the menu I go to the menu now I can click on workouts and there you can see in inside of my custom workouts folder you could actually see this this workout and that's the same workout that I had showed you on the website and we could actually show that just so that we can see that it's basically the same or that it is the same there's that work out my R gdb view of it and here is the lift view of the same workout and you know it would be more efficient if you downloaded multiples ewo files and then did this all at one time but anyway but now that it's here I'm not sure if I have to close with first but in general now it's going to sync across all of my different devices and that's it",
