    "full_text": "are you tired of struggling to keep up with your Cycling group or feeling slow on your solo rides do you want to increase your speed or improve your performance well the good news is that getting faster on your bike can be simply achieved by adhering to our four performance pillars keep watching because at the end of this video we offer a special bonus tip a cycling performance booster hi this is Alex from trainer day trainer day is an indoor outdoor training platform I work closely with Andrea Morelli Andrea is one of the top evidence-based cycling coaches in the world together we will bring you simple concise training advice optimizing your training volume is the first and most important pillar to improving your performance complex training plans and Magic workouts are unnecessary until you're approaching the limits of your personal performance Frank Overton of fast cat coaching is credited with being the pioneer of sweet spot and TSS based cycling in the following video clip Frank emphasizes that increase training volume alone is usually the key to your best seasonal performance and you know did you train more in 2019 than you did in 2018 if you did I bet you had a better season this would suggest that Frank also believes that volume is a more critical Factor than specific workouts or plans we would add to that and say that the right volume at the right time will usually provide you with your best results so what does the right volume at the right time mean it means rearranging your yearly cycling hours by decreasing at certain points in time and increasing others can yield substantially better results even if you're a time crunch cyclist pillar number two consistency it's optimal to have very consistent weekly patterns in your training volume if you're like me this may not happen if you have an incredibly busy week instead of your planned workouts you could fill it in with some very short indoor workouts evidence shows that 10 minute hit or Tabata session 20 minutes including a warm-up can augment your training gaps number three recovery performance gains happen during your recovery periods sleep is the most important method of recovery if you don't sleep at least eight hours a night eight plus being ideal start by turning off any screens an hour before your desired bedtime you can also try the weight lifter secret of taking zma zma contains the vitamin zinc and magnesium it's healthy and it works and it does not create the groggy morning feeling like melatonin if you train consistently patterns of daily weekly monthly and yearly recovery have been the gold standard for many decades for maximizing results taking a day or more off each week a week or more off each month and a few weeks off each year as well as a base period each season will give your body the rest it needs to increase to the next level if you have been cycling consistently and eating well but flatlined in your performance not having the right recovery pattern is probably the reason our fourth and final pillar is about workouts evidence suggests that if you are training six hours a week or more spend most of your time following low heart rate easy rides the start of your season could be all easy rides and slowly as your season progresses you increase the intensity for many cyclists going easy is more difficult than going hard getting fast requires self-control your harder workouts don't need to be complex and you don't need to kill yourself but you will see benefit from following a progressive overload pattern this means slowly and systematically increasing either your intensity your duration or both as Dr Seiler of polarized training points out hard efforts don't need to be incredibly hard and should be sustainable we take that a little further and suggest that you can start with easy intervals and build to hard intervals the polarized Studies have also proven that lower intensity weeks can beat higher intensity weeks so be very careful when you're trying to substitute intensity for volume for most cyclists the most important overload is regarding a weekly long ride you should try to fit in a long ride each week and start small and continually build the duration to your maximum occurring around a month before any event we feel that software platforms and many coaches have put too much emphasis on highly structured training that we also agree that simple moderate sustainable intervals will add horsepower to your already volume-based aerobic engine Outdoors Hills are a great place to do workouts either hill repeats or longer Hills can be Optimum higher intensity intervals and Hill training is most important as you get closer to your peak season ideally this follows a pattern of progressive overload as well and for our bonus tip popular and pro cycling in recent years during your peak season add full effort intervals this means pushing yourself to the maximum for two to three minutes and then rest and repeat start with a few intervals with longer rests and build up from there a tip is to only do one of these workouts every two weeks and keep it short as this puts a lot of tax on your body this workout will add that final end of season peak boost to your anaerobic system if you're enjoying this video please click the like button below and consider subscribing so there you have it four simple steps to getting faster on your bike volume consistency recovery and optionally some fine-tuned workouts as we have said you don't need a highly structured plan even if you only follow the volume consistency and Recovery suggestions you should have an amazing season Andrea has told me that he believes that Pros could frequently improve their performance by having more fun so go do it find your way to train and don't forget to keep having fun best of from Andrea Alex and the trainer daycare thanks for watching this video",
