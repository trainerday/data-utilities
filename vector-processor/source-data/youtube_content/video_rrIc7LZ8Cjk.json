    "full_text": "hi this is Alex from trainer day today I'm going to show you the concept of w Prime balance I'm going to just come into create workout here I'm going to create a very simple workout 1 minute 100% this line here represents 100% of FTP and this little segment here goes to 100% anything below your FTP or is pretty much almost exclusively using your aerobic Energy System so when you do workouts that are over 100% then it starts to use more of your anerobic system so especi so if you're doing 103% well that's still mostly aerobic right it's pretty much going to be aerobic but as it gets up there you know especially 120 plus or whatever even 10 110 or if you have a lot of intervals then it you know uses more of your anerobic system and so FTP is all about Aerobic System if you want to maximize workouts for your Anor robic system then it needs to take a combination of FTP which is basically critical power it's when we design workouts we need to take into account our what's called our W Prime so w Prime is a limited amount of energy it's a certain number of calories or Jewels you can only go over your FTP let's just say at 130% for a certain amount of time and you're just going to run out of energy it's not and it's going to be a relatively short amount of time it's going to be a minute or 2 minutes or something or 3 minutes when you've used up that energy then you just have to rest right you have to go under your FTP probably noticeably under your FTP for a while recover that energy back W Prime here what you do is you you start out by using this calculator or if you know your you know critical power in your W Prime you don't need to but you you do a test and do as hard as you can for three minutes let's just say 3 minutes it could be 2 minutes could be 4 minutes whatever um and see what average or normalized power you can do for that 3 minutes as hard as you can try to keep it pretty consistent and do the same for like a 20 minute test what's your best 20 minutes or what's your best 18 minutes or some kind of longer effort like that um that you really were going as hard as possible right and so once you know those numbers then you come in here you click calculate and you say my critical power is 16 8 my w Prime is and I can say 168 and 14,000 and I can see this little line showing up because we have W Prime Bal turned on you know you can see this little line showing up and because this is over my FTP this means your energy level is going down you're running out of that store and then as you get back down to this recovery then it goes back up again and your energy level gets back to full your your anerobic energy level gets back up to 100% again so this is especially useful when you're doing intervals so now let's just do like five intervals of 1 minute each at 120% and then let's do 1 minute at 50% so now you can see it goes down it recovers it goes down it recovers it goes down it recovers as this dotted line gets down so let's change this to 130% as this dotted line uh we can get off there as this dotted line goes down and it starts getting below this line and gets especially as it gets close to the bottom it gets really hard it's like it feels like I just can't do anymore and if you do 150% right it takes me all the way down to the point of that I've hit zero now that zero is just a mathematical guess as to where your actual energy level is going to run out it's pretty close and pretty accurate but you may find you know that this 14 kog Jews is not perfectly accurate maybe it's 15 maybe it's something else ultimately this is how you can design a workout to take you to your maximum level of fatigue and then you can compare it and try it and say oh did I do it was I able to complete it could I do a little bit more so if it's under FTP it doesn't affect that your W Prime balance right if it's over FTP then it will take your balance down so then when if we come into trainer day here and we we look around at any given workout like this workout I can see also here that if I'm 168 and 14 k then this workout takes me down to a pretty low Place meaning I'm pretty tired but not not dead and it just keeps getting a little bit lower and then it kind of flattens off this would be a very hard workout for most people now if if I only had a 10 K this would be basic Bally an impossible workout for me so it's not only dependent on your critical power but it's also dependent on your your W Prime and this dotted line is called your W Prime balance it's the remaining balance you have left of your W Prime energy source people also call that Anor robic work capacity right or AWC right so anyway so that's a basics of how you can use this tool to design really hard workouts that take you to your maximum fatigue levels and you could do that either in a single interval right I can take a single interval for for uh 20 minutes and put it at 120% and it's going to there's no way I'm going to be able to do that right even 110% there's no way I'm going to be able to do that for 20 minutes can I do it for 10 minutes maybe so 10 minutes at 110% slightly possible I could do it not very likely but slightly possible anyway or or that could be 3 minutes at 150% right so I can't do that 140 can I do 3 minutes at 140 3 minutes and 130 135 so I could probably do 3 minutes at 135 if I have a 10 kle limit at 168 Watts so that's it thank you",
