    "full_text": "Hey, Alex here. I've got some cool new features to show. We've significantly streamlined Coach Jack's method concerning workout durations. This simplifies the process, making it easier to fit within your time constraints. Instead of wrestling with weekly hours or other complex schedules, we've introduced a daily workout duration range. Your first week starts at the minimum time and your last week ends at the maximum time. We understand some days you may require fixed workout lengths. The ideal plan is to provide range so each week increases in duration. This way by the last week you'll be doing a bigger volume than the start. As your plan progresses so will your fitness and performance. Most good coaches suggest volume progression as a fundamental way to increase performance. This strategy is key to fostering adaptations without too much intensity. We hope this update makes plan creation simpler, faster, as well as work better for your needs. Go to Trainer Day to try it out. That's all the awesome stuff for now. See you next month.",
