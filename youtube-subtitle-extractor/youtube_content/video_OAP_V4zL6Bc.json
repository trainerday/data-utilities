    "full_text": "hello this is alex from trainer day i'm going to show you how to load a training plan into google calendar so you clone a plan or create a private plan and once you've got that private plan or you've got this download link here you've set your start week so it's important it doesn't matter which day you set but you should probably start it next week or the following week or you know in the future but i'll just go ahead and select next week i will download my it depends on what type of application you're going to let's say ride in if you're gonna ride in let's say you know use golden cheetah or something you might use an MRC file if you're going to ride in zoo if you might do a zip file but you could still put use the calendaring in Google Calendar so I'll just go ahead and download MRC I click that I get this winter base it's came into my download folders as a zip I'll archive that zip a look in here and now I've got a CSV folder here or CSV file either in Excel you can open that up or you could open it up in Google Docs you could import it into Google Docs or Google sheets I guess it's called but I'll put it in Excel so I'll go ahead and open it here I've got it it shows me all of my workouts it shows what day it's going to be on based on the days that you chose it's gonna always put it at one o'clock you could actually change the time if you wanted you know here in in Excel or you could do it after you import it actually gives you stuff like stress and everything and it gives you these text descriptions so if it's a good outdoor plan you can actually see here you can see these text descriptions and it will based on your wattage that you have entered it'll tell you to do six minutes at seventy four watts six minutes it you know so this is one of the most useful ways if you're trying to do it outdoors and do it manually is to to import that one so let me show you on Google Calendar so I'm gonna come back I went to Google Calendar import CSV I clicked on the first link I click on computer and it's gonna be by far the easiest computer and then it said and this is oops import into Google Calendar and if I want to create or edit a CSV file so it says here create a CSV file so it tells you you need something called subject start date and start time so I believe you can have something called description also if I'm not mistaken description yes so there here's some optional fields so the first ones are not optional these are optional so you just have to make sure and put those in here so let's call this one description and in this description you can also see that there's actually a link to the actual workout which I could open up and you can see and so then in your calendar you'll have this link and you could click on it and actually see this this workout but anyway so I'm gonna use this for the description I'm going to use this is going to be the name I think they called it let's look at their instructions again I think they call say they call it subject so this is going to be the subject the workout time is going to be the start time workout day is going to be the start date so I got start time start date subject they use lowercase start time and start date so let's just do it perfectly like they suggest start date start time I'll zoom in a little bit here so you can see a little better sorry about that so so I've got start date start time I've got description I've got subject so those are the only things that we really need so all of the other columns I will just delete I'm right clicking delete time day week we can delete all of those and I can delete these ok so I've got my subject of the event for the calendar I've got the description I've got the date and I've got the time so I go ahead and save that and then as you can see here they had say import CSV and here they say you can use an editor like Google sheets I'm doing it in Excel but it there's instructions here on how to do it in Google sheets and then you go to your calendar you go to the little gear settings so I'll go to and we click on import export so I'll go to my calendar I will go to the gear which is up here go to Settings import/export so I'll select a file from my computer and in my downloads I've got this CSV file right there that I will go ahead and import then I say import it's importing 16 different events I think it finished let's go back and so we'll look at next week we're yeah sweet spot so I had it I have it on like Tuesday Thursday so you can see my sweet spot at 1:00 p.m. and I can see the link which I can click on to get to the actual workout now if I'm in Google Calendar and and I'm using the free free version of training peeks for example I could actually just come in each day click real quick come in here and say send to training Peaks and then each day I'd just do that real quick then it's gonna show up in Swift or on my wahoo device or on my Garmin device whatever I have training Peaks went sink too so that's a little bit more work if you had the premium version of training piece you could sync it all at one time but if if you're using the free version this would be a quick and easy way to you know have it sync to your devices and thank you very much",
