    "full_text": "hello alex from trainer day here let me show you today how to use a coach jack plan in zwift so here you i am you can see my calendar is empty i'll go up to coach jack beta i will create a new plan i'm gonna well i can use strava that's my name no i don't have a specific goal let's do a 12-week plan i'd like to do climbing no injuries great okay take me to my plan so now jack has created you a plan that he recommends let's just say that he looked at the days that you train in strava but you know my days are kind of random so let's change these days to a better plan a more typical plan let's just say for for up or even the sunday okay tuesday wednesday saturday sunday and let's do our long rides on saturdays okay and then you can see here i've got a ramp rate which means how much does it increase over time you can flatten that down or increase it um you can see my start hours is 11 but i will go ahead and change that to like six and here's a plan for me so now i've got my plan i like it i could change it to a different type of plan or i can even create a custom plan and a custom plan just lets the you pick the workout sequences each week that you like so maybe i want i like threshold blocks or i like something else but i'll go ahead and stick with the serious italian and i'll say okay that's a great plan if i want for example to customize my daily limits i can select that and change it so i only train 45 minutes on tuesdays or whatever i want and then i click save and next and then it says go ahead and send it to my calendar you also have send it to my plans you can read the descriptions as to why the one i'm going to send it to this monday rather than next monday i'm going to send it to yesterday so i'm going to kind of start this plan in the middle i'll go ahead and send it this takes about 30 seconds or so i'll go ahead and pause the video real quick okay that actually took about 15 seconds to do 12 weeks and so uh here i am and you can see that i didn't it didn't send today's work out it just started with tomorrow and uh and it started with this threshold workout so i could let's say move this to here today so then the next thing you need to do is you need to go to your apps and devices if you don't have a training peeks account already you should create one and then come here you have to connect to training peaks and it has you log in and everything and then once you're connected to training peaks you turn on this sync calendar options so i go ahead and sync my calendar and if i go to training peaks right now my calendar is empty but because i have sync turned on and i have a plan on my calendar here because there is a plan now when i refresh training peaks first week workouts start showing up in a couple seconds it only syncs two weeks this week and next week for premium training peaks users that allows more custom manipulations of coach jack you can come back and you can go to check couch jack and you can edit your plan directly in coach jack and modify everything rather than having to modify individual workouts so once i've got it synced to training peaks then i just need to make sure that inside of zwift i'm logged into zwift.com and i go to my account there and i come down and i go to connections i just make sure that can the training peaks is connected to zwift and then when i'm in zwift i come here and i go ride type and i go to training here we got training peaks custom workouts that's all there is to it and then each day when you show up you're gonna see your your training peaks custom workouts here from coach jack i'm using a training peaks premium account which makes it show up all two weeks like this but if you have a free account it will just show up you know your workout will show up each day on the on this day of the calendar so you can still use this feature thank you very much",
