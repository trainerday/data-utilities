    "full_text": "in this video I'm going to show you the Whey Protein Isolate protein powder this powder is incredibly easy to mix and tastes good even in an unflavored version but adding a little bit of flavor adds even more to it okay start by putting a little bit of water in say that much this time I'm going to try two scoops which is 50 g that's almost a full scoop almost a full scoop put this [Music] on so you can see it's just like liquid in the top water nothing stuck to anything no clumpy anything just water so this is a fairly small amount I'll taste that I'd say very little taste drinkable just like that now I'll add a little bit of chocolate so this is 100% cacao Belgium cacao probably not but whatever supposed to be okay there's that much chocolate just oops okay so it's just a very small amount of you can see it here very small amount of maple [Music] syrup bit of 30% cream [Music] okay we'll look at it still not powder not sticky at all just more like milk drink it tastes very good tastes like some very light chocolate milk not sweet at all a little bit more sweet would probably be better for most people but this is perfect tastes amazing to me thanks",
