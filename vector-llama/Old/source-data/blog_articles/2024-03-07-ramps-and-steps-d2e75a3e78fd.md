### TrainingPeaks and Garmin do not support ramps

TrainerDay supports ramps which makes creating increasing or decreasing power targets simpler. MRC, ZWO and ERG files support ramps.

**TrainingPeaks and Garmin do not support ramps.**

So TrainerDay has an algorithm that automatically converts ramps to steps trying not to produce just the right number of steps.

**The problem with Garmin**

**Garmin only supports up to 50 steps.** Generally, this conversion works great but Garmin only supports up to 50 steps total so you have to factor this in when trying to push workouts to Garmin. A workout like the one at the bottom of this page can not be pushed to Garmin. The ramps just increase the number of steps more. Workouts must be simplified.
