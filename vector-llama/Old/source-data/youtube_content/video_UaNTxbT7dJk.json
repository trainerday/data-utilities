    "full_text": "hello today I'm going to show you our broadcast feature which shows you how to broadcast from our training app to a web browser within your PC your Mac your lap your your tablet or you know any other device with a web browser so the first thing you need to do is you need to go into your settings you need to go into other settings or other options and you go to view workout in real time on your Mac or PC and you just need to turn that on once U of A once you've enabled that you go to our website from your computer um and you go here to my activities and you can see that there's a live button you can click on that and click down here and go to the URL or if you have a narrower monitor you can go right onto my activities you can see watch my current training pretty soon we'll change that to a little icon up at the top so if it changes you'll see something different so I'll go ahead and click watch my current training now I've got an empty workout here let's just say I'm I'm on my bike and I start pedaling right and so once I start pedaling you can see your power output here you'll see your heart rate output here you know and you can see all of your statistics here one other thing you can do is you can click this button here you get some more statistics you get your stress which is your TSS your calories your total average um wattage your interval average so that's for the whole workout total is for the whole workout and this is just for the interval same with RPM that averages for the whole thing and the interval and the and your heart rate the average for the whole workout and for the interval so then we go I'll just go ahead and minimize those fields the other thing you can do is is you can do a YouTube video you can add a YouTube video so I go to YouTube foreign click in the browser here I copy it I do or command C or or copy it like that and I put it here I'm doing command V and I click add video I'm on a Mac so it's command I think on the PC it's controller something else anyway so now I have that video so now I can also load that video and press play and watch that video while I'm working out and I still get my additional statistics here so the final feature we have here is add a route so you can add a route but it says because I've started my workout I can't add a route so before my workout starts I'll start a new workout because now I can you know grab a workout file a GPX file for example that I downloaded from Strava somebody else's route this was their mountain bike route so it's kind of circles right so now I have a route and what happens when I follow that route and I and I do my workout I don't it doesn't automatically control the the workout the the slopes based on this particular route this is really more for posting to Strava or let's just say you have a really long ride what you can do is it will break it you can each day you can complete segments of that ride and so if you have a 500 kilometer ride you could do 100 today 100 tomorrow hopefully indoors you're not doing 100 kilometers but the point is you can break it into small Point small pieces and you know follow it each day so I can also you know minimize that so that I'm still just watching them work out okay so that's our our broadcast feature",
