    "full_text": "okay here I'm going to show you how to use W Prime balance in your workout design so here I've got I'm on the sets and reps option in our tool so I can see that I have these five intervals and five rests and I've set my critical power or FTP to two hundred and my W prime to 20 kilojoules and on the side I describe kind of how this works how you can determine your kilojoules anyway so as you can see here this is my W Prime balance and so the balance is what's remaining in my bank account I start out with 20 kilojoules which is at the top and any time I do any exercise over my FTP that balance starts to go down I start burning matches and I'm running out of juice right and if I do these intervals in a row at the bottom at the end I end up with it pretty close to perfectly hitting the bottom which means I should be completely out of energy so this workout if I had a 200 watt FTP and 20 kilojoule this workout would be perfectly designed for me now if I was a 300 watt you know FTP this workout would be very poorly a you know set up for me others I couldn't finish it I could basically almost you know are very close to getting done with three intervals not two that are not five sorry and so you can see that depending on your FTP it changes whether you're capable of doing this now it's possible a person with a 300 watt FTP could have a twenty seven kilojoule you know W primer I thought let's say a thirty kilojoule W Prime the relationship between these two is not necessarily clear meaning the amount of anaerobic energy that you have is not directly related to the amount of FTP that you have and so anyway so you really if you want to design anaerobic exercises or workouts for you individualize for you this tool real improves that right or really makes that a better case you know and you can lengthen the minutes increase or decrease the FDP and shorten the rest and all of those will affect whether you know so if we if we take this to two minute rests all of a sudden you can see oh wow you know this now this is not I no longer went to failure anymore right that red line getting to the bottom means complete failure so I no longer got there anyway that's it thank you very much",
