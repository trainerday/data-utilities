    "full_text": "hello this is alex from trainer day I've got a spreadsheet I've created here that helps me create a build plan and make sure it's safe for its growing at a reasonable level I basically started with minutes per week and I you know build them three weeks building one rest week three weeks building one rest week three weeks building so on and so forth each new let's say month or each new build period I start this one off a little bit higher than the second one here so lower than here for sure and close closer to this middle of the previous and and build up and I've verified these and I've taken that into training piece and verified these increases this is based on TSS if you don't know what TSS is you've got to read about it for a while but I've taken this into training Peaks and I've verified what I did as I started I created a situation where I basically have a three TS B which means you're slightly positive but it means you've also been training and you're you know it's you're you're not completely rested you're just kind of at a neutral standpoint let's say I did that by actually sticking in a thousand TSS points and then letting it drop back down so what I've also done here is I've made sure that my CTL is at 19 so that's why I put that thousand up there also is because nineteen altom utley means that I'm doing 20 TSS or 19 - SS per day times seven is about a hundred and forty TSS per week and so that means I'm basically ready to start a plan that's a hundred a build plan that's a hundred and forty TSS per week or a hundred and twenty TSS per week so so I can see that I'm starting at a negative or at a positive three TSB then I just put in a weekly total here and I say for the week let's just say I started at 140 by the end of the week I would be at minus 13 or roughly - 13 because if daily is slightly different than a weekly total and the same one here I put in a 168 and I'm still at minus 13 then I put in a 200 and I'm at minus 16 and so generally I'm just saying that I've used training peeks to verify my numbers and make sure that they look reasonable or you know even on the safe side as compared to what most athletes can handle and you know if you've got a lot of training history that's very different than if you're a beginner you really have to either have a coach or find your own balance of what that means and and read a lot but I'm just going into what how I basically came up with these numbers so training Peaks also has something in the premium edition called an annual training plan and I'll just show you what that looks like here so one they have the same thing this is a 3-1 pattern 3 up 1 down 3 up 1 down now they're keeping there's this is not a build pattern this is actually pretty flat meaning they're not growing each week so so once I have this pattern then I need to find the individual workouts that actually you know make up that pattern so that so that I end up at that total weekly TSS and so I've created three different types of workouts one's called an SF R which is I don't know how to pronounce it in in Italian but it's Italian that strength training it's low rpm and then a sweet spot or threshold and a long ride and then an extra ride so generally it's 3 workouts a week and each one of these bills this is from 30 TSS 40 TSS then I got a recovery here's my recovery week and a 40 60 and then I'm going 60 so each this is slowly kind of going up and the sweet spot is slowly going up and the long ride is let's say slowly going up so each of them is slowly going up and I did introduce a couple of extras because I didn't want to make the other rides much longer or much longer and so I introduced a couple of days with some extras so that I kind of hit a maximum of close to two hours for a for maybe two hours and 15 minutes or something we'll see how it turns out so then I take this and I say okay now I need to create these workouts I need to create SFR with 30 TSS points with 40 TSS points with 60 so I create four different SF RS for different sweet spots for different long workouts and then my recoveries I've got actually four different I've got a 30 of 50 and 80 and a 100 so also for different recoveries so once I've created those 16 different workouts then I just drag them onto my plan so if I go into my library I've actually already started this let's look at my SFR here's an SF r30 I've created I'll go into edit so it's just got a 45 percent warm-up for ten minutes then a fifty five percent for ten minutes and then we go into a sixty eight percent for reps at sixty eight percent at this you know loke very low cadence and with a one minute 45 percent rest that's it normal cadence and then then I cool down I called down slightly easier because this is a zone to even I would say a low zone two or fairly low zone to workout even though the locatin sis is some intensity I would say that your your warrior cool-down could be slightly shorter than you know it doesn't need to be a full 20 minutes but again if you've got an extra five minutes you could make it an hour and you're not gonna hurt anything but you know it would be I'll probably always recommend it to do longer warm-ups and cooldowns if you've got the time anyway so but I'm just are getting thirty stress and so it's okay maybe I'll change this actually I like that better I would actually go to 65% there that's actually better it's one hour and then we'll go ahead and save that so I've got a SFR 30 I'll save it I would actually take my description and place it in here I would take that one actually take these three I'm gonna improve this this but I would say 45 45 to 55 this is kind of for outdoors if you're going outdoors you would just do it 20 minutes from 40 to 55 cooldown would be from 55 to 45 so this is a good outdoor description if you're writing outdoors okay so there I've got my outdoor description and now when I want to create my next one I just come in real quick and I just go to copy work out and I would just increase it a bit and so that might be might keep everything the same but do five reps maybe make this five minutes five reps and maybe we'll do 70% this time five reps and 70% we're still it let's see here oh maybe we'll do you know that's okay we could do our rest percentage at 50 we're now at 35 that's probably good so it's just I'm basically just creating a progression on you can't see the bottom down here I'm just creating a progression that I've got one extra rep I've got five percent extra in my FTP still a very let's say reasonable stress level so so each time each each week I just want to you know increase this increase everything a little bit not too much but I ultimately trying to get my target up to 40 so I probably want to go 10 minutes at 55 there's an hour and five minutes and let's see what's another good one to do it probably could do 60% here I probably could do a 60% and a 60% it probably doesn't that's 39 it's like it go 71 there we go 71 oops 71 and there now I got my I hit my target goal of 40 and let's make sure I I wrote this description before that's so far 65 this should be an SFO because I cloned it so I gotta take SFR 71% and five of them and warm up and cool down goes up to 60% 60% okay so now I've got my second workout and so I just keep doing that oh and I named it wrong I gotta edit it I gotta call that an SF r40 I'm gonna call it point one because I have another 40 I'll delete the other one and then I just take that work out and I will add it to my SF our workouts and then if I go into SF r I can see I've got a forty point one and a thirty I could delete this old fort even I'll review so anyway I go through that pattern and I just created two of these workouts I've got two more to create and and then I've got you know for here for here and for recovery workouts to create once I create them all I just go in and I create a new plan go to my plans click create a new plan I actually already have my plan that I started which is this one and I take my SF r30 my SF r40 I just you know and I come over here to SF r and I just find those so there's my SF r 40.1 so let's just say I wanted instead of this the 40 I created before I want the 40 point one oops that's not the right work on forty point one so I just drag them on so I go through all my s fr-s first drag them all on here I make sure and get my recovery week each week and leave it blank so let's just come into another I don't know if this is probably not right but anyway let's just come in and I'll do here so I leave my recovery week blank and I'll come back and do all my recovery kind of workouts in the last last thing so I go through that for each each let's say type of training so my Tuesday's is my a so far my when days I would come into my thresholds my sweet spots and I would take a sweet spot I call them differently I was doing this before but now I would come there's a sweet spot it's 50 minutes and but this one I'm gonna change the name it's called sweet SOT 1 I'm gonna change the names to sweet spot 30 or whatever they are so I would just go through all my stress holds now drag them all on here same on my Saturdays I would go into my long runs and grab all my long run so I have where's some there's a 96 minute I actually should have some shorter ones we're shorter I guess that's the shortest right now but anyway my new this is a new plan so anyway I would just grab all my long runs and drag him in him and then I'm just when I'm done I just we can make it public so that's it thanks",
