    "full_text": "hello this is Alex from trainer day I'm going to show you how the coach jack plan Builder will build you a cycling training plan that will help you get faster that will meet your needs that will fit within your time constraints first Jack will recommend you a plan but then you can tweak it as much as you want right all within the constraints of his rules so I'm going to click here on create a plan I'm going to skip analyzing Strava Strava does goes a little bit deeper into what's the perfect plan I answer my questions do I have a date or not if you do not have a date it will um just you'll just do a single block a period of time that you'd have a single Focus so that could be a base period or a build period um and anyway so I'll say I don't have a date just for simplistic and then you pick the number of weeks you want your block to be what's your biggest goal get faster any injuries no how many hours do you sleep at night I like to feel easy polarized Zone ta too what's the average number of hours that you sleep that you've been training lately four to six it asked me that because I don't have Strava you know okay and it creates me a plan here so this is just the recommended plan but you you know you know what you like a little bit more you know you know some of your Styles you know what's resonating with you a lot a lot of training is actually just doing what you like right if you enjoy it if it keeps you more consistent that you know that's gonna that's gonna drive better performance overall is is if it increases your consistency and and usually your enjoyment so so I'll pick one I'll pick the serious Italian that's my favorite for a build period um choose my days I'm not going to split my long indoor long rides I'm just gonna do outdoor long rides and your ramp rate uh your ramp rate is how kind of quickly or intensely your hours build up over time now generally if you want to improve you do two things you are consistent and you slowly progress and then you know we increase three weeks and then drop down a week and then increase three weeks and drop down a week so that's the typical you know what's called a 3-1 pattern and that's what I have here recovery weeks of the 3-1 pattern if I change that to two it would go up two and come down one and go up two and come down one the other thing you can do here is you can customize your daily limits now customizing your daily limits limits the ability of this plan Builder to give you the optimum plan right so it's trying to balance kind of this training load over time and this rain this ramp rate so that you end up uh using you know doing something that gives you there's this concept of training stress balance and when you train too much for too long you'd kind of dig a hole and you need to let yourself back out of that hole and get some recovery and and get okay so so this ramp rate and and uh controls that and the steeper the ramp rate the more you're increasing each week and so you know it gets more risky so we change the color to Orange if it's five right and you'll just see your hours are increasing and you know you know generally it's better to increase your hours slowly and maybe your intensity a little bit but you shouldn't try to manipulate all of your training stress through intensity alone that ends up driving the behavior that you have to are always doing kind of specific workouts let's even say sweet spot workouts just because they're the best at maximizing TSS but that isn't the best at giving you the best performance that isn't the best at having the most enjoyment I mean for some people it might be but um so in order to have a the best plan meaning a diversified set of workouts with different physiological adaptions you know an sfr workout like we have here is great for strength endurance threshold is good for kind of pushing yourself in that long duration high intensity or medium duration let's just say that 40 minute to hour duration it gets you good at you know really really targeting that and it you know and then your long ride is just your is your ultimate kind of aerobic fitness ride in your you know so these three workouts together you know represent a a good balance of different kinds of training that give you kind of different kinds of training stress and so we try to do that with each of our plans is to mix in some different kinds of training stress some you know exceptions to that are something like a base plan that you know maybe only has mostly base work meaning like zone two and the re and just like one workout that's you know more targeted towards intensity or something like that or or just only zone two so so yeah so I can increase that and you'll see that my hours just keep go going so I'm going from 5 to 10 or 9.5 here uh and five to ten so you know anyway so yeah so that's my ramp rate and your start hours for the block is kind of where you're at now right um or where you've been lately so where do we start out we start out pretty much where we're at and we start building from there and and that building process is again the combination of consistency and building up hours and a little bit in intensity is what drives performance right doing a mixture of different workouts workouts that have Progressive overload built in so that the workout this week might be easy next week's a little harder a little harder a little harder and by 16 weeks they're getting pretty hard right you don't need to start at I'm gonna kill myself today and in 16 weeks you're still killing yourself at almost the same level right you're that's there's no Progressive overload and it's even though you're starting out easy today your body and you just increase it a little bit that actually just that causes the adaption so that little even even it's easy you're causing some adaption now if you've been doing a lot of really hard work lately and you're doing really hard long threshold work and you drop back down then you're not going to have any immediate effect any immediate benefit right um you could hold on to what you have or mostly hold on and then potentially meet you know reach a new higher Peak at the end or you know or ideally if you've just done a base period you know like which is usually recommended before a build period Then your adaption you know to to these this gradual Progressive overload works so so that's what you see here so you see you know one two three weeks and then then a recovery week um we don't sfr is not taxing enough that it needs a real recovery so we just drop in one recovery ride here and you know we always recommend a long ride pretty much for just about anybody if you're you know a real sprint racer then during your last you know uh blocks of right before your main race as you might not be doing some long long rides but just just about every cyclist can benefit from long rides so that's when I chose a specific set of blocks um I can also then go in and modify that and pick an event date but first I'll go ahead and show you some other features here real quick so one of them is this intensity uh interval you know the intensity starting interval intensity uh the the coach that helped me Design This on Andrea Morelli um he's been a pro coach for a long time and he starts his pro athletes at level one so these are equivalent to what Pros are doing after a base period And when they're starting out now granted their power is a lot higher and for them doing you know zone two workouts are hard because their power is so high right so so it's a little bit different but um but in general we recommend starting towards the bottom end of this intensity level and really for most people starting at level one and some people are just really want intensity right now they've been doing a lot of intensity they're ready to go for more intensity so then you can boost it up to level 10. now our core recommended blocks and our core recommended block types are not super intense we don't believe super intense is required for you know it needs to get pretty intense right before uh you know a peak period right before a rate you know your main race series it needs to get pretty hard there um but you don't our belief is a in general you don't need to be doing 2 by 20 threshold workouts and and super hard workouts now we do allow you you know users want their own you know they they have their style that they like they like really hard so you can come in here and create a custom block with Sweet Spot hard those are really you know long duration blocks of Sweet Spot workouts you can do threshold hard you can do VO2 masks crunched is going to give you some some tough VO2 max or some condensed VO2 max workouts but we'll just take a like a threshold hard and choose that and and you can choose your three main workouts of the week again we always recommend a Z2 Z3 outside that's that's just a beautiful workout and that's just going on a ride that's kind of riding naturally maybe pushing it a little on the Hills right um getting a bit of intensity and then you know it's starting out at one hour a week building 15 minutes each week or a half hour and just slowly building up that long ride over a period of time is really going to do a lot for you so and it doesn't you don't need to follow the workout that's in here right you can look at the roughly the intensity the Z2 Z3 intensity and see where it's at and kind of just go out and ride your bike and try to Target something something similar and that's good enough so here I've now got that threshold block and if I crank that up to level 10 I now am starting out with you know a three minute intervals of uh at threshold right and and there's there's eight of them so that's definitely that's 24 minutes of threshold it is definitely not easy it's easier than do by 20 significantly but it's still not easy and that workout what that that progression will progress to later harder blocks of you know of of 10 minute duration four tens right is getting pretty brutal um so so it progresses harder and one of the things you can always do is so you can take and make a 16-week block look at the last weeks um you know look at the last weeks say you've got a four by ten here I think I think we've even got a the thresholds are almost even harder but let's just say we've got a four by ten here in these last weeks you can always just pick a specific month in here and you can push it to my or you can push the whole thing to my plans and then you can hand kind of cherry pick or hand-picked individual weeks from my plans and send them to your calendar so you can execute those whether that's in zwift and training Peaks or whatever or you can send them to our calendar and use it inside of our app yeah so then the the kind of the last main feature of the of the plan Builder here is this ride feel so I chose mostly easy zone two the other things I can do is I can do slope mode for secondary work and so what that does is while you're you're you're pedaling it switches from ERG to slope and then in slope really it's probably best to focus on heart rate and look at your heart rate slope you get to control the intensity through your pedaling through your gearing and and get it out of gear and get it at an intensity that you're below your kind of threshold Zone 2 heart rate or you know so somewhere around 65 percent of power or somewhere around you know could be 70 percent of heart rate somewhere but in generally it's below those and so you can read and find out how to find your best threshold heart rate but really this is this is designed to give more of that solid polarized you know training um and follow kind of that maftan style or that you know that pure aerobic style and then the other thing you can do is you can put the main work intensity at the end so that actually moves your zone two to the beginning in your harder workout towards the end and so what that does is it gives you this period of because what happens is when you're training you you're once you if you start with your hard work at the beginning your heart rate jumps up and then trying to get it back to that aerobic Zone and trying to get your body back into a fat burning position doesn't work very well it it you know you're you're a lot less likely to go into a fat burning State as if you put that secondary work at the end right so so putting it putting putting that you know that lower intensity work at the beginning it puts you in that fat burning zone for a long time right and you're always burning a portion of fat in a portion of let's say glycogen but but it puts just more of that it you have a higher ratio of fat burning and teach your body better fat burning skills by putting that real low intensity at the beginning and just kind of riding for you know and then doing your hard work at the end so that's kind of the purpose of that and then each of these just makes it harder and harder and harder and when you go to this last option or you know and you combine that with some really hard work you can you can really create as hard as you want but way harder than we would ever recommend funny okay so we've got let's we got our plan here now you have two options here you can send it to your calendar so it says here but if you're using if you we have a unique feature that you can send it to your calendar and if you sync it with training Peaks then you know you can go back and come back into this editor and change this editor you let's just say you start out the plan you decide oh my gosh it's too hard or oh my gosh it's too easy or I you know wanna I don't like you know I picked a fitness plan or I picked up you know I picked uh something and I just want to change my plan so rather than modifying everything you can just come back and edit this and send it sync it back to your calendar again and it will just update training Peaks and it will go to zwift or Ruby or or full guess or whatever you want um or our app right so the other thing is is the calendar does connect to our app right so if you like a calendar approach you really want to follow it you know Mondays I'm going to do this Tuesdays I'm going to do this and I'm not going to really miss days that much I'm really going to probably hit most of my target days then then using a calendar is great but if you were the type of person that's busy you get distracted you don't end up training on the days that you want and you're using our app you might want to send it to my plans because my plans allows you to do a sequence of workouts so really there's no difference whether you have a plan that's on a calendar in specific days or you're just doing a sequence of workouts as you have time there's not much difference as long as you're getting a reasonable recovery there's not really much difference between the two it's just that this one's a lot more flexible you can you know you show up you do your workout the next time you show up you do your next workout you show up you do your next workout so so sending to my plans gives you that option the other thing that's sending to my plans does is it allows you to download this plan it allows you to you know send it send it the whole plan to training Peaks or intervals ICU if you want or to Garmin so if you want to really manage your calendar in another application you might want to send it to my plans and then send it from my plans to that Final Destination or download it and and get it in that Final Destination um yeah and then once you send it to your plan it's kind of like a plan and it's a reusable plan like I used it this year now I want to use it next year right um I'm just going to keep you I'm going to use that plan if it works well I'm going to use it over and over again or I'm going to modify it from one year to the next anyway so if you send it to my plans it's kind of a reusable plan you can send it to your calendar anytime you want um the the disadvantage is if you are using our app or if you plan to come back and edit in coach Jack in this UI where you've got all these sliders and you know choices once you send it to my plans it's kind of final you've got to create a whole new plan if you want to start something new right so if you want something that you can go back and edit and you want it to kind of just continue on from where the the intensity level that you started you were at and all the different things and and just kind of continue on and you do want a calendar approach then it's definitely definitely better to send it to my calendar and the other thing is it's going to start on next Monday by default this is like a Monday through Sunday plan all the time and so you know it's going to send it to next Monday by default but you can change that to whatever you do want or you can just save it as a draft and come back later and and use it so I already have a plan on my calendar so let's just say I'm sure or at least I'm pretty sure I do let's just come here so yeah so I have a plan on my calendar some of the different things you can send multiple plans to your calendar so you can have overlapping plans you could pick a one day a week plan and then send another plan that's another one day a week plan so you can have a bunch of simultaneous plans to come up with some really creative options as to how you you know are going to to work that right so or how you're going to use that and then you can see each of the plans here and you can you know you can see the start date you can click here you can can go back and edit the originals so if I go back there you know then I can go back and edit my original plan that so rather than you know going into my calendar moving let's just say all of a sudden oh my work changed and I need to change my plan and uh and I I can't work Thursdays anymore right or what let's just say I can't I can't train on Wednesdays anymore so I'm going to change Wednesday for Thursday I'm going to get rid of Wednesdays and Thursdays so rather than moving my individual calendar days I can just come in here it just moved everything to Thursdays right it just moved my Wednesdays to Thursdays and now I can send it and it will update my calendar without me having to tweak every workout in there right so it's a great benefit now these particular days right here are already completed right these weeks have already gone by this was associated with a start date of 12 12. this is a plan let's say I theoretically started on 12 12. and so those you know those days are gone by and that's why they're grayed out you can uh if you enable Wahoo you can download your plan from here if as plan files that you can send to Wahoo you've got your plans here and you've also got my plans here so these are Jack plans in the Jack editor and Jack coach Jack stuff and you can edit you can clone you can delete right you can view it on your calendar because that's where it is or you can view it on my plan because I sent it to my plans and see it on my calendar right so so depending on where you send it depending on what it is it that that's how it shows up here so that's it that's coach Jack plans it's a long video I don't know how long it was but let's see thanks bye",
