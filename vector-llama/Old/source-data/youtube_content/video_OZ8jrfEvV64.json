    "full_text": "hello Alex from trainer day here I'm going to go a little bit deeper into W Prime balance and how it works so I've got an example workout here you can see it's 60 minutes at a hundred percent which is basically an impossible workout for everybody that's got their FTP set correctly or nobody would be willing to ever do this or try to do this anyway what you can see here is you can see this red dotted line and that is my W Prime balance a room or my remaining energy and this is like a gas tank since it's at the top your gas tank is completely full you're not draining your anaerobic energy now in reality you are at a hundred percent you probably are a little bit but as the model goes you're not so my point is that this is not designed for measuring your aerobic difficulty or how hard a workout is it's only to measure how much anaerobe remaining anaerobic energy you have so we can take another workout this is under overs and you can see that even then even though it does go a little bit over your FTP and is using a little bit anaerobic it's still not a good indicator of how hard this is this is actually still very hard and you wouldn't notice that so so let's go to a more of an anaerobic workout so here we've got an anaerobic workout that goes up to let's say a hundred and fifty percent of your you know of your FTP this is a Tabata style workout and so this is 40 seconds of work with 20 seconds of rest and so this is where W prime bow really works is for these higher intensity interval training right and or just anything that's noticeably above your FTP and then you can see you know you have this little warm-up here and it drops a little bit but it almost recovers completely but then it drops down perfectly right meaning it's dropping down and so by the end of this fourth interval you should be completely drained but this is designed for a person with a hundred and ninety three what you know FTP or critical power and a fourteen kilojoule w prime if this is not you let's just say you have a 300 watt FTP at a 14 watt kilojoule now this workout is incredibly hard you will you will it you can't even finish the third repetition of this right because it's too hard for you now if you're you know kilojoules are higher let's say 20 again then it's perfect for you and so it totally depends on what your actual FTP are and how many kilojoules you have right or how much your W prime Bala your W prime is it you know how many kilojoules do you have in your W prime so let's just say that you you know have a twenty kilojoule two hundred watt let's just do two hundred 120 kilojoules now this is an easy workout for you it's a moderately easy it's not too hard so what do you do you make it harder right so so maybe you need a hundred and sixty percent right or 165 right so then you can see now it's getting close to failure again so you adjust your workouts to make them so that you're getting close to failure right you know you don't have to go all the way to failure right you know what you may want to do and and what marked from golden cheetah recommended to me is that you may want you know you may be a writer that going to failure is fine you like FTP tests you like going as hard and you it like hitting the end other writers don't like that so much and so you may want to do more reps let's just let's add a rep in here I'm gonna move this one down a row and I'm gonna add another rep like this and and I'm gonna make this just one of these and I'm going to lower the intensity in this one 150 oops so 160 and 140 130 so so now you can see we actually have to close to failure points but not complete failure so your motivation level might be higher too to get too close to failures than rather than one total failure so you you want to kind of play around with this and see what's better for you to close to failures might produce better results or similar results as one total failure and it mentally might be easier and less challenging for you so you want to find out what works for you and you want to optimize it and ultimately go try this work out go try this for intervals you know let me refresh the page let's just say it's this workout 20 let's change it back to 14 you know get it optimized for you go close the failure and see can you go could you have gone farther could I do more than these four you know was it too hard for me if if it's too hard then you're this your W prime is probably a little bit too high right it's possible your your FTP or critical power is off also but let's just say you have an established critical power you feel comfortable that it's your or your FTP that it's it's correct or close to correct and probably your w prime is a little bit off right if you can't finish this or if it's too easy so so you want to adjust that and and the next time you can make it a little bit harder anyway this is the value of W prime I an or W prime bowel and ultimately you know hard an aerobic workouts for a lot of people are not the most important thing or for most people I would say you know you're really more focused on your aerobic workout so something like this and so if you're focused on your aerobic workouts which you should be and most of the time then then W Prime Valley isn't such a useful feature right then it's more about intensity factor you know how hard do you want to ride you know there's different theories some people like these threshold you know let's say sweet spot or threshold level rides others feel that you know other styles of training are more important anyway if you're short on time a lot of people feel that these these Tabata style workouts are actually you know a 30 minute workout can give you a lot of let's say boost even to your aerobic power even though you're doing an anaerobic workout in a very short amount of time so anyway thank you very much that's it",
