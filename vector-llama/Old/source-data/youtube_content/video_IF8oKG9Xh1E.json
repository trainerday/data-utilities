    "full_text": "hello this is alex from trainer day i'm going to show you our new workout search features so as you can see here we now have got these three buttons as well as some minutes between stress between and intensity between many of our users have got large libraries 300 plus workouts in their libraries and trying to find the workout you're looking for or the perfect workout is a little bit difficult so being able to only search your library with let's just say every every 60-minute workout or every workout in your library that's between 40 and 45 and 60 minutes just gives you a more options for for finding it when you have large libraries so that is a probably a feature that the large library people will love text descriptions i'll show you let's click on one so this particular workout here is 240 minutes or four hours that is a very long workout and so it's definitely a workout that's better for outdoors than indoors i not many people like to do 4 hours indoors but 60 minutes at 70% for a warm up let's say and then there's 4 10 intervals at 93% or 35 minutes in between and the rest so so anyway so this text description is great for outdoors if you want to send it to yourself write it down do whatever it makes it much easier to follow this I mean this one you can fairly easily memorize but some are a little bit more difficult you might want to write them down so that's what text descriptions are good for then author description is let's click on show you that's easier so authors put some some great descriptions today you'll write in easy 30 minutes you know whatever so you just keep going and you can find some really good descriptions describing what what may be the benefits are for you or you know when to use this workout or whatever so so because we have 5000 workouts being able to find ones that are more relevant to what you're looking for is a you know is a great benefit and I am using this a lot now so we've also got minutes between stress between so as we said we could do at 45 minutes to 60 minutes and we can find more detailed so you could search up here before for kind of 60 minute workouts but if you want something more granular or more perfect this is just a better way to be able to do that and stress between so that's the total training stress if you are following kind of the training Peaks model of training finding the perfect stress level based on your weekly targeted stress and especially when creating a training plan you can create you know you can ultimately search for all of the really hard workouts let's just say 0.92 to 1 oh not stress sorry you could search for yeah I want a 100 TSS to 150 TSS or whatever so then intensity is the intensity and that's where you put this point 9 versus 1 if you were looking for really hard workouts with probably a minimum warm up and cool down this would this would provide those workouts and so this is obviously a very hard workout and as you approach this 1.04 intensity that's you know the hardest that you can have handle and you can also sort by you know by default we sort by date but you can sort by all of these different sort by field so that's the strip that's the workout feature we hope it's great we hope many people love that those feature I know I do and I know many people have requested this so hopefully hopefully you do thank you",
