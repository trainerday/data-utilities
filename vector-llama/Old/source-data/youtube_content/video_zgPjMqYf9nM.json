    "full_text": "hello this is alex from trainer day i'm now going to show you one of our more advanced features of the app i call it hot swap and basically it lets you change out workouts so let's just say i started this workout it's got a five minute threshold followed by a three minute followed by a two minute and you know i go ahead and start pedaling and i'm pedaling along and then i start thinking about it and i goes oh this is the same workout i did last week i was actually supposed to do something a little bit harder this week so i made a mistake right so so i'm in my warm up you know uh and i decided i'm gonna go find the workout i was supposed to do so then i go look there it is it's instead of number zero it's number one i grab it and now it just swapped out that workout and this one has got instead of a five minute threshold it's got a five and a half minute threshold and so it's a sequence let's just say it's a sequence of workouts that i'm doing in a row and i didn't have a you know good training plan or i'm kind of doing a dynamic training plan or you know not a real structured training plan so this just lets me have a progression within there and then say i changed my mind again or you know i had an idea that i want to do some blocks instead i realized oh i want to do some blocks so here's a block an interval set that i could just throw in anything i want right so i can grab this one you know four interval set of looks like a hundred and ten percent or something throw it in there and i'm doing this instead you know and then i could switch back to that other one obviously doing a warm-up for two minutes or a minute and a half and then switching to uh switching to 110 that's not a good idea but the point is is you can just switch things out whenever you want you can even go to the website create a new workout or a new block of a block is really an interval set and i could just throw it in there dynamically so if you're doing a longer session you can now ride by feel you know you can you can do whatever you want right you can you can create create a workout on the fly as you're riding and you know and do some really interesting stuff i think people should ride by feel more often and so this gives you that chance to do this you know if you're on a strict training plan obviously this doesn't make as much sense right unless you know sometimes for example maybe today was supposed to be a harder workout and you just realized you just are not going to do it right it's just like you're not going to be able to do you know what last week's was super hard and you know you just don't feel well enough to do it so you didn't get enough sleep last night or something else so you go ahead and just pick something easier and switch to a you know a less demanding workout right or just take a recovery day if you're not if you're not meddling into it you know an active recovery day so that's the feature that's how it works um i think people have a lot of fun with that and uh and it's something interesting that nobody else is doing so enjoy it thanks have a great day",
