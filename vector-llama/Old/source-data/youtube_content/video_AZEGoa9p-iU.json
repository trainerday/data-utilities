    "full_text": "hello here's a quick video showing you how the coach jack plans module works if you went through the recommended process these values will all be set for you he will jack will choose a plan for you set your start hours do a suggested ramp rate what we'll look at here is we'll change our start hours to let's say 4.3 first thing to start out with is make sure your start hours are approximately what you're doing today could be a little more could be a little less you don't want to make a huge jump at least up because your your training stress will be too high now if you're more than four months out from your peak period generally it's recommended to maybe take a a base period or take an easy period or you know but if you really want a hard winter or you know you just you're coming in here and wanted to do something hard then you can treat it more as a build period and during a build period you're one you're increasing the intensity of your workouts you're doing harder and harder workouts as well as increasing the time and that will maximize your your performance at the end of that four months let's say and that's approximately four months some people might hit a peak in five months most would be between three and four months so so you have your start hours set and then you do your ramp rate slider so like i said if you want to do a build period and you're ready to increase your hours a lot for a lot of people that's best to start in mid to late january but if you really want to start it now you can if you're not ready to then you can keep this ramp rate slider at more around three so that you just have kind of weekly variations and these weekly variations actually create stimulus in themselves and will actually create improvement without increasing your hours and without increasing your stress a lot but if you're ready to do a build period then you probably want that up but somewhere between a four a five um and different people can handle different amounts of ramp if you ramp up too much if you ramp up to an eight or something that's more than almost all writers can handle maybe if you're 20 you don't have a job you're genetically gifted then maybe an eight is okay but for most people a five or a six is really is really an optimum number and that and that comes from the concept of of something that joe fryle presented and training peaks presented our ramp rate isn't exactly like theirs but it's it's it's very close and it aligns fairly it let's just say right now at 3.9 we we end up at 8.5 at the end um you know then you're going to hit your peak period and you really want to kind of dedicate these last two months it's like okay this is the period of the year that i'm really gonna do the most i possibly can to to maximize my benefits so once we have those set we make sure that we've got the right plan you can kind of click around see which one makes the most sense to you if you really want to get faster we're recommending the serious italian and i'll go into more details into that later you can also set your plan length make sure your training days are optimized for you if you're doing four days a week this tends to be a good pattern for people tuesday wednesday saturday sunday especially if you've got weekends to do longer rides so you can see here it says best days for long rides and then you can see down here you can see your workouts and you can change anything in real time and just see how it affects your plan you can increase these sliders so if i increase my so here i start with a 35 minute and a 32 minute you know one hour and 30 minute but if i increase those hours you can see that it goes from 56 to you know it it it increases those hours right so so you can see that all in real time you can change your days in real time you know i took off the long ride so this day just shortened now i could take it off completely and you know and you can see it disappeared um and let's see so and then the final value is this starting intensity level generally we recommend everybody if you haven't been doing a lot of intervals lately or you're you're kind of starting your a build period we recommend everybody starting at one that doesn't matter if you're a pro or you're uh or you're a beginner you know you can start at one and it's going to feel easy our plans are different than other people's and again i'm going to create another video to explain the benefits there as well as do an interview with the top coach that will explain the concept behind that and and then once you know but you can increase it and when you increase it you can see here that let's shorten this a little bit and it makes it more obvious so when we calling this a threshold really this first threshold series is uh is actually just one this is a warm up with like a 30 second and then there's actually just a one minute threshold effort which is easy for basically everybody and it's comfortable and it's let's say reasonably enjoyable i mean if you're like killing yourself it's probably maybe not that fun and then as you get towards the end you can see then you have more and more and if we get you know if we get up here to 15 um let's go even farther so let's increase create this starting at four if we let's go back to here now you can see we actually have like a three minute interval so um that starts at like three minute threshold and i know for many people they'll think what this isn't even training but but trust me there is a different philosophy out there that you can get as much benefit and potentially even more benefit by doing shorter shorter sessions but doing the right sessions right and again i'll go into that in a later video so but then we get up here and we get into number 18 and and these get into you know i think it's two four-minute intervals so you get you end up with eight minutes of threshold which starts to be you know if you've gone through all 16 weeks it's not too bad i mean it's still intense you know threshold is threshold and it's always it's not especially indoors is not particularly always enjoyable but it gets into something more reasonable and there is kind of a progression it's a z2 z3 z you know z4 progression to get to that threshold so now we've got our our plan and we click on send weeks one to four to trainer day so this is much faster the other benefit is is that you can do the first four weeks try it out see how you like it and if you need to you can come back for the next four weeks and if you have to you can increase the intensity a little bit or modify your days or whatever and then you're not dealing with moving those workouts all around if you've got to move 16 workouts you know so 16 weeks of workouts around that's a huge amount of work and so dealing with one you know four weeks at a time or one month at a time you just come in you click four four weeks then you can come back in here and i can show you that later you can come back and create the next four weeks and and you can do that and we'll even start doing that automatically very soon creating that if you do one through four it will ask send you an email and ask you if you want to create the next one so so i'll go ahead and create weeks one through four here so here i have weeks one through four now they are in the trainer day plan editor now you can move works at workouts around you can do whatever you want with it you know you've got your basic structure down one thing i didn't show them the last one is the fourth week is always a is always a recovery week so we drop the threshold we reduce the intensity of the stress and the and the hours a little bit but you can move anything around you can do what you want with it and the other thing you can do is then you can send it somewhere you can use it so you can send it to training piece you can send it to garmin to intervals you can set the schedule at which you where where you want it to start in that place plan and it's something reusable if you want although with coach jack you can always you know come in and generate a new one and we're going to keep enhancing this so so next year i'm sure that jack will be even better than he is this year we're quite happy with it though so you can send it or you can download it if you want to manually load those workouts into another training platform you can or you can click on edit plan and you can and you can say add it to my mobile app and so then when you log into our mobile app you'll actually have this plan available for you to use you also can send it to training peaks and if you want to manage a calendar there and use it inside of our app still or send it to intervals icu and use it inside our app still so anyway so that's if that's if you want to send it inside use it insert our app and that's it thank you very much",
