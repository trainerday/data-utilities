I could just copy and paste each of these in here like this and then when I change this first 130 to 140 it changes all of them to 140 and you can see my average watch just went to to 260 or if I go 115 I can see my average Watts just went to 225 and then I can just copy and paste this these three rows it ignores kind of that middle row so I just copy and paste these three rows they're all 115s in here I've got my new workout and I can save it and I know my average thanks",

I did a work out today that was: 5 minutes warm up @ 40% in ERG 10 minutes @ 135 HR The graph output from this is: image1144\u00d7493 44.7 KB My HR was low after the warm up was ~ 103 BPM. It took about 8:46 to get close to the 135 BPM target at 132 BPM and then it controlled at about 124-131 BPM for the next minute plus until the interval ended. Is the ramp up supposed to happen at this speed? Should have I given a higher wattage in ERG mode so it wasn\u2019t so far away and could control sooner? If HR is set to 135 BPM what is it actually attempting to control to? ~ 130 BPM? I tried to merge a different work out at this point and ended up aborting. I imagine the 10 minutes I had here is not what it was designed to support. Is it really supposed to work with intervals that last 30+ minutes? Dave\nContext: User describes a specific workout setup and issues with heart rate control.\nUser Problem: Difficulty in achieving and maintaining target heart rate during intervals.\nAnswer: Hi if you do 5 minutes ERG warmup 1 minute ERG at 70% and then 9 minutes at HR target it will ramp up instantly. Right now by default HR does slow adjustments to get you to your target. Having a starting higher power average (from ERG) will start HR from that point. Make sense? You might want to go, 5% under target to give a small ramp like below. image1016\u00d7290 21.5 KB\nSolution: Adjust the workout to include a higher power average to improve heart rate ramp-up.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I thought the BPM target would be the heart rate, but you have 70, which is more like an ERG target. Am I not understanding how to make a HR based workout?\nContext: User is confused about the relationship between BPM target and ERG target.\nUser Problem: Misunderstanding of how to set up a heart rate-based workout.\nAnswer: My example is confusing. I should show 70% FTP and 145BPM as better example\nSolution: Clarification on using 70% FTP and a higher BPM for better understanding.",

        "text": "Forum Q&A: Optimal Zone2 HR Target\nCategory: Training Theory\nTopic Type: Training Execution\n\nQ&A 1:\nQuestion: Anybody has recommendations on an optimal zone2 training. Let me make the question more specific. I\u2019m using the HR function to do indoor zone2 training. But zone2 is a band, with lower and upper limits. To make it worse : to define zone2 \u2018exactly\u2019, one would need a lab test with lactate (and even then there\u2019s still debate where exactly it is). My question is : I worked out that my zone2 must be somewhere between 100bpm and 128bpm. With some room for an error margin in it. What would now be the HR target with the \u201cbest\u201d expected adaptions? Is it something like 120bpm, or rather 110\u2026 110 is clearly much \u201ceasier\u201d.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about the optimal heart rate target for Zone 2 training.\nAnswer: It\u2019s all debatable but I would say up to 120, so in our app just setting 120 should rarely go over 120. It\u2019s better to be a little under than over (in theory and according to Maffetone).\nSolution: Set HR target to 120 bpm.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: How was your 128 calculated? I\u2019m in this zone 2 discovery process too and my resting HR is 53 and max after 20min threshold test was 178. Only percentage of max HR way of calculating would take my zone 2 limit as low as 123bpm. Most of the other ways of calculating I have found (karvonen, HRR, British cycling method) Z2 limit is anywhere from 139 to 155 bpm. I think I\u2019m just going with the perceived exertion breathing test now.\nUser Problem: Confusion about how to calculate Zone 2 limits.\nAnswer: Threshold shouldn\u2019t have you hitting your max HR. You max should be higher. 20 minute warmup followed by 3 sprints with 2nd and 3rd being all out for a minute or so will. Slope mode is good for the 2nd and 3rd. I have a workout that is a test for max HR.\nSolution: Use a specific warmup and sprint method to determine max HR.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: I did the threshold test recommended on the British cycling method. Warm up 20 min, ride at a sustainable pace for 30 min then take the BPM average of last 20 min. I didn\u2019t look at my HR numbers during the test just did it on feel and checked after. Was this not the right way? Edit. I did sprint at the end.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about the validity of the threshold test method used.\nAnswer: Oh sorry, I did not clearly look at your numbers. I see you are using thresholdHR to determine zone 2, not max HR, so that is fine it might even be better.\nSolution: Using threshold HR for determining zone 2 is acceptable.",

        "text": "Post 16 by Alex:\nI just lowered that bottom number to 130 for the test.\n\nPost 17 by Sport_IT_Diederik:\nThe Maffetone calculation method. After that the breathing validation. That brough me to 128. So I put the HR target at 120 (usually). This means it sometimes jumps to 123-124, which is not a problem. I now started putting it at 110, just playing around a bit. It\u2019s all not very scientific, but I\u2019m not training to beat Pogacar Part of it is fun to see what happens over a 4 weeks period. If I would want a more accurate number, I would need to go to a lab to do lactate tests. Which I can\u2019t be bothered with to be honest. Last winter I did almost exclusively Zone2. Not yet using HR, since Trainerday didn\u2019t have that functionality yet. I managed to do the Gran Fondo of the Col de la Loze this summer while \u201cenjoying\u201d the experience. Which is good enough for me. This winter I\u2019m making a change. I\u2019m pretty much riding 6 days out of 7. 4 days Zone2, 2 days some sort of SST or HIIT (or an ad hoc combination). Started doing that beginning of October when the weather turned bad. It\u2019s a game changer. Looking forward to the summer for a lot of reasons now\n\nPost 18 by MedTechCD:\nI would recommend starting with the basic Maffetone calculation and use that as a HR cap. Set your target about 5 bpm lower and allow +/- 5bpm as a zone. While becoming more experienced at training in this zone, pay attention to your breathing. If the target is correct you will start to notice, after several weeks, that you can distinct two breathing patterns within that zone. In the lower region, you will feel very comfortable and breathing will be 95% steady. In the higher region you will notice some small irregularities in your breathing pattern. Every now and then, a deeper breath, especially when breathing out. That\u2019s the point where you need to blow off some more CO2. It\u2019s really subtle and you will not notice if you don\u2019t pay attention. But if you do pay attention, you will be able to guess your HR, without looking at your device, within 1 or 2 bpm. It takes some time but being able to workout almost purely based on \u2018feel\u2019 makes it even more enjoyable. You get the feeling that YOU are in control of your work and not your device. The feeling of freedom and not needing to do what anyone or anything is telling you to do is, at least for me, even more relaxing.\n\nPost 19 by Sport_IT_Diederik:\nWhich one do you take as your 'target\" ? The \u201ceasy breathing\u201d one or the \u201cirregular\u201d one? That was exactly my initial point : when I put my target at 110, I\u2019m in the easy, enjoyable zone. When It put it at 120, it\u2019s EXACTLY like you describe. I\u2019m curious for your opinion !\n\nPost 20 by MedTechCD:\nZone2 training is exactly what it says, it\u2019s a zone. I do have my HR limits on my device set at 180 - age - 10 to 180 - age. The breathing pattern is sort of a double check. When breathing becomes \u2018irregular\u2019 I back off a bit on longer Z2 workouts. On shorter onces I may allow more time at that \u2018higher\u2019 limit. But it is important to work the whole zone. That will make you more efficient over the entire zone. It may sound somewhat surprising but even heartrates around 100 can be very effective, if they are long enough.",

        "text": "Of course, when you start a new activity, you need to build up strength and stamina for that particular activity, but once you get to a basic level, it really doesn\u2019t matter. Sometimes, a different activity can even be more beneficial. For instance, riding your bike stiffens your back or shoulder muscles. In that case, I would recommend going swimming or rowing so these muscles are stretched and the metabolism inside these muscles is stimulated to help recover. Finally, it can be really refreshing for the mind to do something else. Listen to your body, your mind, and your ambition, and decide how you want to spend your recovery time. Have fun, Coach Robert\n\nPost 3 by Bobinski:\nRobert, Thank you for your kind words and helpful response. I will try rowing instead of the Monday recovery ride. The latter varies between 45 and 60 minutes. I have often rowed for an hour. I may start with 30-45 minutes though unless consensus is stick to the recovery time ride equivalent time. One further question. Normally i wouldn\u2019t do a leg workout after a recovery ride, but I am wondering if there might be some value doing post row because of the different muscle groups used? eg. full leg extension. What do you think?\n\nPost 4 by Robert_UCL:\nYou\u2019re welcome. you have a good base in rowing so, there is no problem with the recovery time on the row ergometer. There is no point in doing extra work on a recovery day. In the end, you can train all day, every day, as long as you start your workout fit. The working out part of a training schedule is overrated. The resting and recovery part of that schedule defines how much work you can do and, therefore, how much progress you can make. So relax and take time to recover.",

I\u2019m trying something new now as the title suggests, running cycling and rowing, mainly to reduce the amount of running injuries i get, and I think it is a good plan as I am not getting any younger. I was happily surprised to find rowing workouts now available here and i look forward to trying them. Just trying t get everything synced at the moment. Has anyone tried the 3 disciplines together any ideas for how to plan them all together? (to start with i\u2019m going to do 2 days a week on each sport\u2026mainly endurance and VO2 max workouts.)\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nSweet, I love to see people return and for sure remember your username I have a online friend that has been doing this for many years and it works very well for him. I also believe in this same strategy and have a rowing machine but after years of doing the bare minimum I am just ramping up my cycling but would love to do all 3 + weight training. I think it is a very good strategy especially if you can get the right recovery in and dial in the intensity. If you want, let me know and I can ask him to share his experience here. He seems happy to share knowledge. He does serious multi-day across Africa bike trips and stuff but he considers rowing his primary sport. Not sure if he profile is public.

And when you get to top coaches they suggest intervals and training with power but most fitness rowers focus on extremely constant top pace\u2026 Anyway happy to see you again.",

I would like to see this study with 1 4s sprint per hour\n\nPost 13 by Retsam:\nI did not ask authors yet about their study design (why just 4s x 5 x 8), but followed one of the references, by same texan team and the same 4 seconds mantra. It is a 2021 study: Inertial Load Power Cycling Training Increases Muscle Mass and Aerobic Power in Older Adults From \u2018results\u2019: Cardio-ankle vascular index was significantly decreased \u22122.3% \u00b1 1.1% (P < 0.05), indicating reduced arterial stiffness. Then one hour spent on re-reading discussion sections from those three documents \u2018saved my day\u2019.\n\nPost 14 by Alex:\nYes, I think you can do very minimal high intensity and get significant results. I would guess a person could do 2 X 5 minutes a week of strength and 2X10 minutes a week of high intensity cardio (5 minutes warmup, maybe something like 10 X 4s with rests) + 2m cool down and get most of the health benefits. Obviously this is not scientific, but just an opinion but after lots of reading and talking to people such as Andrea I believe it is likely. These guys message is mostly marketing but they make lots of claims about the most minimal type of training. carolbike.com The Bike That Gets You Fittest, Fastest\u2014With Workouts Backed by Science |...

However suggesting that Carol ergo is necessary is a marketing trick for public. By chance (thank you Alex for Trainerday) I can use your super easy slope setting and with appropriate tuning generate huge power spike from low RPM to high RPM in 4-5 seconds. Protocol is not set in stone (I see it from cited studies) and connecting HR monitor (and my old Track + Elite TUO) is largely enough.

Power is not held to the power prescribed in the workout. Also, the power readings seem to be completely off. My Garmin Edge 530 controls the trainer just fine. What could be the problem? (assuming it\u2019s on my side, since I don\u2019t see others complaining of similar issues)\nContext: User mentions a specific timeframe when the issue started.\nUser Problem: The TD app cannot control the trainer and power readings are inaccurate.\nAnswer: If you are connecting Garmin edge at the same time it will take over. Turn the Garmin off and see if that helps. If not try restarting your phone. There is a way to fix this garmin issue by connecting to your edge as a power source not as a trainer.\nSolution: Turn off the Garmin Edge and restart the phone; connect Garmin as a power source.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I usually control the trainer with the app. it\u2019s not even setup on my Edge (I obviously connected it to do a couple of workouts, but it wasn\u2019t connected before). just to make sure, I again removed the connection to the trainer from the Edge, and when controlled by the app on my phone the trainer still behaved the same (power was not kept constant, but I do see power readings. don\u2019t know how accurate they are). am I maybe missing a step somewhere along the way? any suggestions?\nContext: User clarifies that the trainer is usually controlled by the app and has removed the Edge connection.\nUser Problem: Power is not kept constant when using the app.\nAnswer: Bronek, your user name sounds Polish (if it is I live in Lodz but my Polish is niedobre\u2026, or maybe not\u2026 just thought I would say hi if it was.) Your trainer really should work. You do have to make sure your gearing is right (more in a middle gear usually) on your bike and obviously you have the wheel tightened down correctly. You also should do the wahoo spin down process using their app. If you have done all that and you want to send me a video to support@trainerday.com or screen shots here or to my email of your connections popup and what it looks like on the workout screen maybe it will point out the problem.\nSolution: Check gearing, ensure wheel is tightened, perform Wahoo spin down process, and send video/screenshots if issues persist.",

I like the app a lot and I\u2019m months away from getting even a modest smart trainer.\nUser Problem: Higher wattage readings on non-smart trainer compared to other apps.\nAnswer: Yes, your actual watts are not so important, especially since what ever estimate it is is fairly inaccurate. If you take an ftp test in our app it\u2019s fine for doing the workouts. If you want to get more watts you just need to pick a trainer that shows more watts for a given speed. You can see all our curves here. shared-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com virtual%20power.pdf 471.72 KB I also lived somewhere, that I was the only person with a bike so I understand this remoteness.\nSolution: Take an FTP test in the app; choose a trainer that shows more watts for a given speed.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: The trainer on this bike (Giant Cyclotron Mag) has no smarts at all. It is set to position 4 as per Zwift. Systm does not support this trainer so I have set it to Kurt Kinetic which gave me the virtual power which I believe to be correct. I was hoping that I could specify the trainer in Trainer Day. I\u2019m a long time Zwifter looking to escape the gaming environment and am trialing several other apps. I\u2019m very grateful for any and all help.\nContext: User is transitioning from Zwift to TrainerDay.\nUser Problem: Inability to specify the trainer in TrainerDay.\nAnswer: I tried searching online. I don\u2019t see any way to specify the trainer settings that Zwift would use. (You say you/zwift chose Kurt Kinetic?) I also tried searching in TD app, but since I don\u2019t have any sensors (speed) connected, I don\u2019t see a way to select trainers as well. Finally - power data in this way (via speed) is pretty inaccurate. It won\u2019t really matter much which trainer you use I would think. Additionally, since you\u2019re moving from zwift to other apps, and since zwift uses simulated speed from diff terrains, it really won\u2019t be the same at all when u move to other platforms.\nSolution: No specific trainer settings available; power data via speed is inaccurate.",

I noticed a certain irregularity, namely the undulation of the trainer load. This is visible in the training graph. You can also see how the cadence changes under the load. I\u2019ve brought the training to the end (HR mode). Then I changed the connection to BLE and there was a significant improvement. Power control is as expected.

It is a great complementary application to my training. I like to use progressions in my training over time. For example: a four x five minute block with two minutes of rest will be changed to a one minute rest. Once adapted to it, I will add another block of five minutes. I see there is an ability to add time, 10 seconds, to an interval, or increase/decrease power. What I am looking for is the ability to modify a workout, that I have created. I may be missing it, but once saved, except for what I mentioned above, I cannot find a more robust means to modify my workout, and re-save with changes. Such as reopening the workout in workout creation mode where I make a few modifications and get back to training. I am trying to avoid creating multiple workouts for with slight structural changes, like an added interval, or changing the finish of a workout. Thanks\nContext: User is new to TrainerDay and is looking for ways to modify workouts.\nUser Problem: Cannot find a robust means to modify saved workouts.\nAnswer: I assume you mean this? image2864\u00d71298 360 KB\nSolution: Clarification on the edit function.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thank you for the quick reply Yes\u2026that would be one workout IMG_1349828\u00d71792 115 KB IMG_1350828\u00d71792 86.8 KB I tried to upload two other screenshots, and that did seem to work. One was a 5 x 5\u2019 workout with 1\u2019 rest between. That was a workout I did today. Today, I did it with Z2 watts. If I was to that workout with sweet spot watts at this time of the year, I may want to increase the rest to 3 minutes. If I used Z2 watts again, I would use 8\u2019 blocks, which would increase the length of the workout at the same time. Ideally, if under an \u201cedit mode\u201d it brought me back to the original creation screen on the web application, I could quickly make my edits, save the changes, and get to work. I may be asking too much. In a usual week, I train intervals on Tuesday and Thursday. One day use short intervals, the other day is long intervals. I was hoping to have a workout template for each day. Modify it as appropriate for the time of season, or area of training I am focusing on, like 5 x 5\u2019s. I believe more experienced riders train this way. Plus, it saves on storage Just trying to keep it simple. Nothing fancy. Over the years I find simple works best. I do look at other workouts for ideas, and like the search capabilities of TrainerDay. Hopefully, this explains my question better!\nContext: User elaborates on their training routine and needs.\nUser Problem: Wants to modify workouts easily without creating multiple versions.\nAnswer: As R2Tom points out edit mode let\u2019s you edit it with original data. So I am confused. But maybe you are saying you would like to be able to edit in the app or at least click edit in the mobile app and open the web app? My guess is this would save about 10 seconds of time but maybe I am not understanding. Or maybe this 10-seconds is important\nSolution: Clarification on the user's needs regarding editing.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: @Alex BTW, we spoke once about editing a workout straight in calendar, any plans on it? My typical routine is that I copy a whole week in TP, paste it to the next and modify them exactly as @Oldmanbiker described. At TD I need to copy workouts, modify and paste new versions of them which takes longer. Rigid training plan is kinda inflexible.\nContext: User is asking about future features related to editing workouts in the calendar.\nUser Problem: Current process of modifying workouts is time-consuming.\nAnswer: Sorry some how this fell off my radar. That seems like a pretty reasonable request. What is the source of these workouts? Ones you create yourself, or clone from others or coach jack?\nSolution: Asking for more details on the user's workflow.",

I\u2019m a 50+ working cycling enthousiast, enjoying cycling, but with one big goal : an Alpine event this summer. I\u2019m usually doing my \u201ctough day\u201d on a Wednesday. As probably a lot of us recognize, one Wednesday is not the other. For pro racers, a fixed workout makes perfect sense : this is what you have to do (unless you are sick). For us, working class cyclists, it doesn\u2019t work like that. Which is where THE top feature of Trainer Day comes in. My point is : I can take a schedule with 3x10 HIIT repeats. One week it can work, the other \u2026 not really. Of course you can always stop a session and scroll forward, but I hate doing that. Or the other way round, sometimes I feel really good and I would like to add another block (I realise pro cyclists are not supposed to do that, they have to follow the exact schedule, but again, I\u2019m just a working guy). So what did I do : I created \u201cHIIT blocks\u201d (Trainer Day - Workout: Sport IT HIIT Block 10). From 10 repeats, over 8-6-4-2. I start with a workout plan I think I can do. Or with no plan at all. Do my warmup and then take a 10 block to start. After that, I add whatever I think works that day. It\u2019s one of the stunning features of Trainer Day which totally works for me!\nContext: User shares personal experience with HIIT training and how Trainer Day features help him adapt workouts.\nUser Problem: Difficulty in sticking to a fixed workout schedule due to varying daily conditions.\nAnswer: You are doing it perfect, in our opinion!!! Even pros should be training by feel. I am working on a video right now talking about this. We would love to have the ability to \u201cadd an an interval set work/rest\u201d with 1 click which would even simplify that farther, but I do the same as you so I know it\u2019s not that bad other than in the middle of something hard fiddling around kind sucks. Really happy, this is working for you though!!!\nSolution: Encouragement and acknowledgment of user\u2019s approach; mention of a potential feature for easier interval management.",

I\u2019ve tried to create one of these in my own workouts, but haven\u2019t tested it yet. I tried this the last time I did a ramp test but I couldn\u2019t even get the HR+ feature to drop the erg low enough. I think I had a pairing issue which I think won\u2019t be a problem going forward. Not sure if you can see my privately created workouts. If not I can share it and you can provide feedback on how to create it better.\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nYou can create your own workout. You could search for and clone our Automatic workout and just modify the first segment to automatically be HR+ mode and the switch to ERG. Just make sure the title contains \u201cRamp Test\u201d and it should automatically calculate your FTP\u2026 It\u2019s an interesting thought.\n\nPost 5 by Quinnrm:\nIn general I like the idea of being able to have a work out in the queue that would start immediately (or at least pop up with the option to start) after the first is finished. It would make it easy to use the same warmup with various workouts and tests without need to create a ton of workouts.\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nYes it works that way now. Meaning you can start one workout and when you start your last interval just go to your favorites and click ride now and it will insert it at the end of the current warmup you are doing.\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nI should also say on the workouts/plan tab you should see recent workouts so you can always do more than one.",

They have prescribed zbit training programs that I\u2019m wondering if anyone has made TrainerDay programs for (they are various 60 on 10 off etc) I find it hard to figure out how to pedal to keep up with the changes in the program and before trying to crate the workouts myself wondering if they exist. Thank you\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nThat\u2019s an interesting product. I just did a brief look. It\u2019s a cool idea in general but I need to look at it more. So when you say program in I assume you mean program in HR targets? Right now I want to remove all public workouts (I don\u2019t think there are very many public ones now) with HR targets since we use specific HR not % of threshold or something else. Our workout creator is super fast and you could even use ChatGPT to generate excel spreadsheets possibly and then copy and paste the workouts into our editor (just an idea).\n\nPost 3 by Bdo811:\nThey have a set of workouts for the zone 2 recovery part. They look like this IMG_84091290\u00d72573 126 KB IMG_84101290\u00d72569 226 KB\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nOh that\u2019s a unusual prescription of intervals when talking about heart rate 5-10 second intervals all out. So you should use our slope mode intervals not HR intervals but then you could do ERG to drop the power and then do HR intervals for the recovery and press + button to extend the workout. This is interesting and hard but unusual use of HR. This might require more explanation on how to create this workout as prescribed in TrainerDay but I think you can do a good job of it\u2026 Let me know.\n\nPost 5 by Bdo811:\nIs there a way to program that so that TD mirrors what their app is trying to get you to do?\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nYes but realize for example \u201call out\u201d or as hard as you can is not something you can program, it\u2019s something you must do. You can program very hard in ERG but any particular day you can be stronger or weaker. I will post an example of how to program this.\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nSo there are multiple approaches to how to solve this problem. One is the \u201cperfect\u201d way from a TrainerDay workout creation standpoint which is design the workout exactly true to what they are saying. Like this image image2464\u00d71884 412 KB For the 2 minute HR segment press >> button to extend 2 minutes to what you need it to be during the workout until you get to z2/blue zone (turn on our zones in settings). Next time you can set this to the time you actually need, some people might be 2 minutes some might be 5 minutes. I feel that is a bit complex, I would do it simpler (I can explain a simple workout if you need) Another final way is do it more like outdoors and do it all manually. And just not program it Click on quick start and click slope mode for 1% Warmup watch your HR so it gets to the top of zone 2 Increase slope to about 4-6% Shift gears and go as hard as you can for 10-15 seconds lower slope to 1% or shift down and watch your HR until it gets back to Zone 2,6) Repeat step 3,4,5 - 10+ times cool down\n\nPost 8 by Norsemanfit:\nI found these two workouts worked well with my Morpheus HR targets. 1st one called ( there is no try ) IMG_05401125\u00d72436 175 KB",

A sorting filter would be much useful where we can sort authors along their proficiency and qualifications as professional trainers or coaches.\nContext: Discussion about the quality of workouts available on the platform.\nUser Problem: Difficulty in identifying qualified workout authors.\nAnswer: Hi, you are correct. Anyone can create workouts. Actually due to an individuals physiology, recovery state and propensity for suffering, the right workout at the right time is highly individual. We would argue that it\u2019s better to start under your current intensity threshold and slowly build up to reach and increase that workout intensity threshold. This is our belief which including my partner a world tour coach (Andrea Morelli) that is in a unique space so he has also coached many amateurs for the last 30+ years. Many coaches are almost like spin bike leaders and prefer to just making your start suffering from day one. While this can produce more rapid results it is much more risky and is not the best for longevity of training. Coach Chad at TrainerRoad used to preach \u201cminimum effective dose.\u201d I don\u2019t believe the TrainerRoad platform delivers on this idea but this message resonates with me and I have a lot of respect for Chad as well. Do just enough to get the adaption you need. So this said, I think without a coach it\u2019s a bit of trial and error to find what works for you. There are a lot of classic workouts that are very, very hard 4X8min @ nearly VO2max, 2X20min @ threshold. These are painful and I suggest gradually working your way up to them but in reality we don\u2019t even think you need to go that far. So all this said, I would say creating a workout is a neophyte process because finding the right workout for you is a bit of trial and error. This is the beauty of Coach Jack based workouts, as they start easy and build to hard and very much follow a pattern of progressive overload that anyone can follow. If you don\u2019t want to follow a strict calendar and are training indoors you can create a coach jack plan and push it to \u201cmy plans\u201d make that plan active in our app and then you can just follow the plan one workout after the next as you have time to do them. All this said, I would love to have workout authors fill out their bio\u2019s but most of the popular workouts here are actually just long running ideas of workouts coaches and platforms have suggested over a long period of time. Many coaches use our platform but coaches have always used their own personal workouts as \u201csecret weapons\u201d although most top coaches actually agree the workouts themselves are not the secret but the specific plan including the right volume patterns for the right athlete are 80-90% and the workouts are secondary to this. FYI: I used to try to get authors to give bios, but it was not working. So I fully agree/agreed with your thinking here If you need more explanation in simple terms. Use coach jack or just ask and I can give you a few ideas on the basics. We have similar beliefs to Joe Friel, author of the cyclists training bible.\nSolution: Use Coach Jack based workouts for progressive overload.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: If I find favorite authors, that would be nice to be able to download their workouts in batch instead of one at a time.\nContext: Follow-up on the discussion about workout authors.\nUser Problem: Inconvenience of downloading workouts one at a time.\nAnswer:",

Tanya\n\nPost 2 by Cesar_Nunez:\nYes, you can copy your workout. Go to your workouts and click on the 3 dots at thebupper right corner, then select copy workout. A new workout will be in the same list with the same workout name you copied and a dash after the name and the word copy. That\u2019ll be your workout clone. Then click again the 3 dots at the upper right corner and select edit workout From there you can modify all the parameters on each interval, delete or add more intervals as well After all your changes, just click save button at the right end.

I accept advice, thanks\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nIf you are not over doing it all the time, I see no problem with this. If you are tired or run down then maybe not the best idea.\n\nPost 3 by LunethG:\nAlong these lines, is it possible to create a MAF test that goes right into the TD Ramp test (automatic)? I\u2019ve tried to create one of these in my own workouts, but haven\u2019t tested it yet. I tried this the last time I did a ramp test but I couldn\u2019t even get the HR+ feature to drop the erg low enough. I think I had a pairing issue which I think won\u2019t be a problem going forward. Not sure if you can see my privately created workouts. If not I can share it and you can provide feedback on how to create it better.\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nYou can create your own workout. You could search for and clone our Automatic workout and just modify the first segment to automatically be HR+ mode and the switch to ERG. Just make sure the title contains \u201cRamp Test\u201d and it should automatically calculate your FTP\u2026 It\u2019s an interesting thought.\n\nPost 5 by Quinnrm:\nIn general I like the idea of being able to have a work out in the queue that would start immediately (or at least pop up with the option to start) after the first is finished. It would make it easy to use the same warmup with various workouts and tests without need to create a ton of workouts.\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nYes it works that way now. Meaning you can start one workout and when you start your last interval just go to your favorites and click ride now and it will insert it at the end of the current warmup you are doing.\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nI should also say on the workouts/plan tab you should see recent workouts so you can always do more than one.",

We know if someone cloned a workout, we could remove the clones that are similar, that\u2019s a good idea. TrainerDay does not create workouts except when it is dynamically generated as part of a Coach Jack plan (other than the 20 free workouts and a few random ones). So all workouts are user generated.

It\u2019s a pain to get hundreds and hundreds of workouts with similar names with just a character changed and similar things\u2026 Or maybe there is a way to get as result only original workouts of Trainerday app?\n\nPost 2 by Alex:\nYes, good point. We know if someone cloned a workout, we could remove the clones that are similar, that\u2019s a good idea. TrainerDay does not create workouts except when it is dynamically generated as part of a Coach Jack plan (other than the 20 free workouts and a few random ones). So all workouts are user generated. But I recently recognized that we need to start doing more cleaning of these public workouts. Or somehow make it more clear what public means because people create too many public workouts these days In the beginning we wanted more and more but now we want less So you saying this helps keep it prioritized on my list.\n\nPost 3 by Alex:\nCan you also give me an example of what you are searching and seeing duplicates?

Then I have already a Polar H10 which is connected to both TD and to my garmin What I dont get is how to know if the polar is connected through the Bluetooth or ANT+. Could you help me on this pls? I never heard about alpha1 (incredibile how many thigs there are out there ahah). Do you have any articles or something to suggest to read? Is there any application to be installed on the garmin? Thank you\n\nPost 13 by dduffey:\nOn your garmin watch, go into the \u201csensors & accessories\u201d menu, you will see your sensors. You can click on one of your connected sensors (like your Polar) and then \u201cAbout\u201d, it will list \u201cTech: BLE | ANT+\u201d. Note that the \u201cAbout\u201d sub menu only works if the sensors is currently connected. That will let you know if it is connected via BLE or ANT+. For the Polar, you can connect to both at the same time from the watch, therefore I added them both as sensors and appended \u201c-a\u201d for ant and \u201c-b\u201d for BLE on the sensor name, I then turn \u201coff\u201d the \u201c-a\u201d sensor so it doesn\u2019t auto connect and only the BLE sensor connects. If you find it\u2019s connected via ANT+, just turn it \u201coff\u201d in the watch and then do a \u201cAdd New\u201d under sensors. Sometimes after it searches there is another submenu item like \u201cSearch Bluetooth\u201d as well. This I think happens if it finds ANT+ devices first, you need to tell the watch to keep searching for BLE as well. Then for other sensors (like cadence) I tend to use ANT+ for garmin, leaving the BLE for trainerday. I also found I can add my smart trainer to my garmin via ANT+ to capture power data, etc., and as BLE to TD (to control the power). Just make sure you\u2019re only running a workout on TD to avoid conflicts and then use the garmin just for recording (the garmin will not control the smart trainer via ANT+ if you don\u2019t run a workout and just use it for recording). Here is the alphahrv app: Connect IQ Store | Free Watch Faces and Apps | Garmin I honestly don\u2019t have enough data or types of rides yet to say if it has value or not. The author of that app is active on intervals.icu, so if you search that forum for \u201calphahrv\u201d and \u201crr/a1\u201d you\u2019ll find a lot of discussion and links to other articles.\n\nPost 14 by Mark9:\nThank you very much for the info.

Are all of the features such as HR targets, slope, etc, primarily oriented to utilizing the TrainerDay app to perform workouts? Anjother way of asking this is what features in the TrainerDay Builder will function in TrainingPeaks and Indoor training with a Smart Trainer? These workouts would be done on Zwift, primarily.\nContext: User is transitioning to using TrainerDay with TrainingPeaks and Zwift.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about feature compatibility between TrainerDay and other platforms.\nAnswer: No Zwift nor TrainingPeaks supports HR targets or slope targets like our app does. You can create HR workouts that go to TrainingPeaks but not auto HR like we have, and that won\u2019t work in Zwift as far as I know. You can use our app to control the trainer and still ride in Zwift if you have Ant+ with Zwift.

        "text": "In that software, we work with FTP, and for this exercise, during the BASE building phase, we will treat Critical Aerobic Power as FTP as displayed in those apps. Start with a Traditional base plan that is a low-volume or mid-volume plan in said software. One that\u2019s 100% endurance riding with recovery weeks. Watch out for things that claim to be traditional-based but have tempo and other work in them for \u201cvariety\u201d. Also, an Endurance ride is always >= 90 minutes. You will have to delete tempo work and find endurance work from prebuilt plans. (If you have a training-peaks account, you can get me to build your plans, and I\u2019ll load one of many combinations for you, but really anyone can do it). If you are off the couch, guess your FTP and enter it into the software. If you are ending the season and rebuilding, take your current FTP and use FTP-15. If you are in Ego group 3, then just use your FTP and follow the rest of the rules and put the ego in the garage. Begin riding your first endurance ride. Complete the warm-up. Then 5 minutes after the warmup, If your measured HR is below MAF_TE, then increase the difficulty of the workout using the percentage gauge or equivalent mechanism. If your measure HR at any time is close to going over MAF_TE, then decrease difficulty. During the Peak parts of the workout, you want to be in the range of MAF_TE - 10 <= Measured HR <= MAF_TE -5 That\u2019s the sweet spot for the peak of the workout. When building the workouts, we want at least 30 minutes total to be that intense. Never less that that; and sometimes a lot more minutes to put cardiac drift strain on the athlete. A workout that forces the person to keep lowering the difficulting to keep the HR in the zone; is not a bad workout; it\u2019s an Endurance building workout. (((Important not to see those as failing because it\u2019s not))) Overshooting MAF_TE is to be avoided at all costs. One minute over can derate the workout about 80% so don\u2019t do it. Re-read this until you understand it Cardicate drift is going to happen lower the difficulty is HR training; it\u2019s not a failure\u2026 Continue to adjust throughout the workout. After the workout is done, consider what your average % adjustment was that kept you just under MAF_TE Adjust your FTP estimate by that %. If step 6 felt like +6% then increase FTP +6% if step six felt like -20%, then set FTP to FTP_estimate * .8 repeat starting at step 3 on the next ride. By the end of 2 weeks, you should find that you have to do little to no adjustment, and you\u2019ll be pretty close to an FTP that complies with your current Critical Aerobic Power base. Finish the rest of the six to ten weeks on a traditional base. Six weeks if you are resetting after a season. Eight weeks if you are a recovering FTP junky, and ten if you are off the couch or trying to lose weight. During this time frame, you adhere to: MAF_TE - 10 <= Measured HR <= MAF_TE -5 If you have the time, you can loop through the base phase for as long as you like. Each loop-through will build more and more CAP. This is great for older folks or injury recovery. With the traditional software, you can watch your progress via CAP expressed as FTP. When FTP stops going up for an entire loop, then it\u2019s time to move to Polarized no matter what. Now credit where credit is due.",

My fear is if you add the classic climbs your distance will be really low and I think most people want longer distances.\n\nPost 4 by Postmeister:\nI know it\u2018s weird, but I do like the maps If you could include them in dropbox it would be great. Currently I have Fun Routes, Climbs and Interesting Places turned on and today it was a relatively flat course with 69 m elevation gain. So it\u2018s not always the big climbs. But generally you\u2018re right, I\u2018d prefer more distance over more elevation gain.\n\nPost 5 by Cyclopaat:\nIf I compare my \u2018flat\u2019 Tacx recorded (via the Tacx app) rides, to the virtual ones I do on BigRingVR or Tacx TDA/TTS, I\u2019d probably have easily passed the 25-27.5K km mark for this year already, instead of the 20K where I am now\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nCool, I am really happy you like them. I like them too. I am not so worried about distance so the map is cool. You can turn off climbs and you will only get flat routes and get more distance that way.\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nYes this could be a service, a virtual ride route flattner we kind of like Tapiirik with a flattner service to give you more distance.\n\nPost 8 by Cyclopaat:\nI already have that. This from the Tacx app controlling the Neo, while I was virtually riding Eikedalen on BigRingVR. This is a relatively minor distance deficit, but on long climbs, it can be 25 km climb - 65 km \u2018flat\u2019, or something like that. Screenshot 2020-11-23 at 16.58.383496\u00d7200 48.8 KB On Strava, I only log the virtual rides, also because they have segments. Well, you can\u2019t make those anymore on new rides (or at least only private ones), but I hope they will reinstate that feature for parties like BigRingVR to create official segments and no \u2018Your Mom Smells Like Donuts\u2019 crap.\n\nPost 9 by Postmeister:\nPostmeister: It would be great to have an integration with runalyze in the app, so that the rides will automatically upload (like Strava and TP). This request was solved this week, when runalyze.com added automatic dropbox imports. Now my rides are automatically imported to runalyze.com from the TD dropbox folder. Currently it\u2019s in beta for supporters and premium users only, but I think it will be available shortly also for free users. Finally I no longer need Strava for anything",
