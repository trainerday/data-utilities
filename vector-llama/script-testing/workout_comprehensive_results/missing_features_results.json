A month ago, with this workout, i used to get a training effect of 3 or 3.1. Now i am getting 2.8. My body adapted i guess. I need to increase the watts. Instead of re creating a new workout or editing the current one, Can i just increase my ftp ? would that increase the watts? Not sure on how much i should increase though. Advice ?\nContext: User is tracking training effect using Garmin and has noticed a decrease.\nUser Problem: Need to increase training effect without recreating workouts.\nAnswer: Yes, just increase FTP. Looks like 10% improvement but pretty hard to say for sure. I would probably increase FTP 5% and see how it goes.\nSolution: Increase FTP by 5%",

I did when the zone 2 was introduced with TrainerDay. I rode 5 times a week around 3-40 mn each times. After a few weeks my Vo2max had decreased. I use a garmin that gives me a aerobic and anaerobic training effect to see if the workout was effecting improving my cardio vascular fitness. This is really my main goal with cycling. I alternate with strength training when i do not cycle. During these workouts at zone 2, my training effect was low and had no impact on my aerobic fitness. I decided to do 75 mn this morning and got a training effect of 2.3 that is giving me maintaining status. To impact my aerobic fitness, i need to reach a score of 3.0. I assume that i would have to ride 60 more mn to get to that. I do not have the time to ride 2 and half hour every morning. I guess this is great if you are a full time athlete and ride for living.\nContext: User is reflecting on their experience with Zone 2 workouts and the impact on their VO2max.\nUser Problem: VO2max decreased despite regular Zone 2 workouts.\nAnswer: Garmin status is the worst place to look for this stuff. Their advice is terrible in general. You should measure something that is much more accurate for example HR/power ratio over a longer period of time. Their VO2max estimate is very dependent on your exact target power / hr again not accurate for fine tuning. For sure if you do pure low heart rate for a longer period of time you won\u2019t feel super strong and \u201cready to race.\u201d It won\u2019t get you in top shape quickly. It\u2019s really meant to be a part of a seasonal periodization plan. It has some strong health components but if all you care about is current fitness level then for sure it is not what you want to do. I saw significant measured benefit doing 20 minutes a day 7 days a week. Each person is unique. If you read Maffetone you realize making aerobic gains from strict zone 2 frequently requires a very focused effort. For example he points out that many people combining weight training with low heart rate endurance work will completely stop any aerobic progress. So as you point out it is not for everyone. It tends to be best for people that want to hit a peak outdoor spring time with a lot of high volume, hard cycling, people that seem to get sick often, people with high stress lives and people with a tendency to overtrain. Also people that put health at much higher priority than fitness should take a closer look at more zone 2 work. For a person that just wants a smart simple year round pattern, polarized training year round at 6+ hours a week is a good choice and proven effective.\nSolution: Consider HR/power ratio over Garmin's metrics and focus on a seasonal periodization plan.",

I hope my question is not dumb\u2026\nContext: User is utilizing a Garmin Fenix for tracking workouts.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about whether to focus on stress or intensity for aerobic training.\nAnswer: Great question! In general, for aerobic training, you want to focus on higher intensity rather than just higher stress. Higher intensity workouts will typically yield better aerobic adaptations. However, it's also important to manage your overall training load to avoid burnout. Keep an eye on your EPOC values as they can give you insights into your training effect.\nSolution: Focus on higher intensity for better aerobic adaptations while managing overall training load.",

You\u2019re Right at the Edge of Your Current Capacity If your legs were close to cramping, and your HR climbed that much, you\u2019re at the limit of what you can absorb and recover from in a single session. That makes this a perfect training stimulus, but also confirms that doing more would likely push you past optimal and into burnout. Final Verdict: Your heart rate response was healthy, appropriate, and a strong indicator that you\u2019re training in a smart and effective way.

I know Joe Friel suggests < 5% decoupling is good. I am not sure how much heat is affecting you, because if you are heating up I would also consider this good. If do happen to be well ventilated, at a reasonably low temperature, I think either you have room for aerobic improvement or you also could try the same test with 130bpm and see what happens. What was your breathing like? How easy did it feel compared to going on a walk? If you were really following Maffetone\u2019s suggestions then it feels too easy for most people when they start doing efforts like this. Also focus on deep breadths and you will see your power go up\u2026 but most important from test to test is consistency. So just from a test perspective to compare to the future this seems good.\n\nPost 20 by BlackTek:\nThank you @Alex ! yes, <5% is good (source) Heat was ok, temperatura in the room with HT is 15\u00b0. I forgot to switch on the second fan, I did at the start of the third segment, and you see that power went up. I\u2019ve drunk water every 2 intervals (every 10 minutes) The breathing was not like walking, it was ok, I surely was able to talk, but surely not like resting / easy walking. It was harder to keep 180w steady on the HT, the thing I dislike is that you never rest/pause/coast like on a real bike But it was ok. Yes, I focused on deep breadths, and tried to be constand with rpm (but not a perfect job with rpm). I did the test without breakfast, and I also forgot my espresso I think that at 130bpm is not taxing enough, and the stimolous is not very good (in terms of training). But this is still unknown territory for me. In terms of power it was low-Z3 for me. How to understand/decide if it\u2019s better to ride at lower/higher bpm to train aerobic endurance? The decoupling was good, so surely it was exclusively aerobic work. Right?",

This work makes up the base of a pyramid, a base that will be so strong that you can build high peaks on it later on. So continue to have fun and \u2018Smell the roses\u2019!\n\nPost 3 by Sport_IT_Diederik:\nAgree with all of the points made. 2 additional remarks: HR is indeed variable, can be different from day to day. With Trainerday, the +/- is what it takes to tune it. It\u2019s HR before Power. I had a conversation on it with the GCN guys and they actually asked the question on one of the videos of Dr. Inego San Milan. HR is closer to representing what it\u2019s all about : what energy system you are using. And that\u2019s what you need to train, not the power as such. I\u2019m currently looking into non invasive lactate measuring devices. Unfortunately one of them was too early on the market and the company from Texas is no longer around. There\u2019s another one I\u2019m looking into, but it\u2019s quite expensive. Don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s not used more often. But that\u2019s another story in itself. When doing Zone2 work outside, you need to look at a combination of power and heartrate. For the simple reason that heartrate is dragging. Especially on climbs, look at your power of which you know it\u2019s your zone2 ceiling. Don\u2019t go over it (which means : switch back to real low gearing and have the willpower to drive so slow uphill). The heartrate will catchup and you stay in the zone. What I did since end of september is zone2 all week indoors. Saturday going out for a ride without looking at numbers. Like somebody on a diet with one day of \u201cno diet\u201d. On Sunday I do a zone2 ride outside. Since this week I started to do one HIIT session indoors in the middle of the week. Taking the advice of somebody else on this forum : first a good portion of Zone2, the HIIT at the end, and not the other way round. It\u2019s all big fun to work with, and the results are stunning\n\nPost 4 by MedTechCD:\nYou are on your way to make good progress for years to come You already understand when to prioritize power and when HR is more important. As I said, HR gives a picture of the internal load and is what you should follow for endurance rides. Never compare from one ride to another, average over multiple weeks and compare periods to see progress. Power is external load and gives a better picture on performance improvements, especially in the higher intensity zones, where HR becomes unusable due to the lag.\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nAs a low HR focused guy for last 12+ years. I love to hear peoples success. I have not been consistent enough to get fast but my aerobic engine significantly improved.\n\nPost 6 by inuitive:\nIs the heart rate that good at estimating whether am I working in zone 2? Currently I feel like to be below or around VT1 could be a better \u201cmetric\u201d perhaps? My subjective example experience from today\u2019s workout on a trainer indoor was that I was at VT1 (nose inhale, longer mouth exhale) but heart rate was creeping above the zone 2 rate and I was sweating. Then a cold wind gust came through the room (felt really nice) and the heart rate jumped down by 3-5bpm. This repeated every time another gust came in. At that point I realized that I\u2019m seeing higher heart rates at similar wattages than 2-3 weeks ago due to being overheated (it was freezing outside weeks ago, impacting room temperature). However, I\u2019m also seeing that the wattage wher I\u2019m able to be still at VT1 is getting higher as well. Working at zone 2 power, VT1 but higher heart rate diminishes aerobic adaptations? Anyone with any experience and / or thoughts about this?",

I\u2019ve been a part of this community for just a week, and until tonight, I faced challenges managing the ERG mode. In other words, to stay in line with the target power during a workout, I always struggled to find the right balance between cadence and gear. Adjusting the power, whether increasing or decreasing, didn\u2019t always yield the desired results, the same as when switching from ERG to SLOPE and vice versa. I was on the verge of giving up on our app, I even purchased an Ant+ dongle, but nothing seemed to work. (Elite Direto X + Samsung A52S 5G) However, tonight, I discovered that riding with a lighter gear (primarily in the cassette) makes the trainer\u2019s reaction almost immediate. The resistance increases or decreases in sync with the app. It might sound like a stupid solution, and perhaps you were already aware of it, but it works, \u201crepetita juvant\u201d.

For the Cooldown, I switched back to ERG, but the trainer continued to act as if it were in SLOPE mode. I stopped and restarted a few times to no avail. This is a ZWIFT Hub trainer, and works great in every other respect. See image of the end of the workout below:\nContext: User describes a specific workout scenario with a ZWIFT Hub trainer.\nUser Problem: The trainer does not switch back to ERG mode after using SLOPE mode.\nAnswer: Thank you for reporting this one. When I\u2019ve tried to reproduce this bug it was working correctly in in the vast majority of tries but indeed not in all of them. Is it this issue occurring for all slope -> erg changes, or it\u2019s more random? Best regards, Marek from TrainerDay\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: I had same issue today when switching to slope for sprint efforts then back to ERG for z2. I could only get it to re-engage by stopping completely then switching to ERG and increasing and decreasing the effort % I was following Hit a#6 workout using Android app and Series H2 trainer.\nContext: User describes a similar issue with a different workout and trainer.\nUser Problem: Difficulty re-engaging ERG mode after using SLOPE mode.\nAnswer: Are you guys using Android or iOS?\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: I am using a H3 with an iPhone. I had the same thing yesterday after switching to slope to do VO2 intervals the. switching back to erg to do sweet spot. Had to close out the app and restart the workout to get erg back\nContext: User provides details about their device and workout experience.\nUser Problem: Inability to switch back to ERG mode after using SLOPE mode.\nAnswer: Ok we are working on one potential solution now.\nSolution: Working on a potential solution.\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: We are able to reproduce this, but it seems really random. We are still trying to figure out how to reproduce it regularly so my developer can fix this.\nContext: Alex provides an update on the issue.\nUser Problem: Randomness of the issue makes it hard to reproduce for a fix.\nAnswer: We are able to reproduce this, but it seems really random. We are still trying to figure out how to reproduce it regularly so my developer can fix this.\nSolution: Working on understanding the issue better.",

Also there is some variability here. Here is the basic idea below with similar torque levels and approximate mid-point of RPM target. So yes around 47-48 as a mid point depending on actual % of FTP you are targeting. image2284\u00d7874 55.7 KB Below you can see the formula = (30 * B4) / (PI() * C4) image2098\u00d7810 52.3 KB\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nHere is ChatGPT\u2019s response, which usually is looking at a large body of evidence. Yes, there is evidence suggesting that low-cadence training may have specific benefits, particularly for cyclists seeking to improve muscular strength and torque production. Here\u2019s a summary of what the research and practical experience indicate: Improved Neuromuscular Adaptation: Low-cadence training (e.g., 40\u201370 rpm) at higher resistance increases neuromuscular activation, mimicking strength training principles on the bike. It helps in recruiting more muscle fibers, particularly fast-twitch fibers, which are important for explosive efforts and hill climbing. Increased Muscular Endurance: Sustained low-cadence efforts can increase the muscles\u2019 ability to resist fatigue under higher loads, benefiting performance during steep climbs or time trials where torque is essential. Better Torque and Power Output: By training at low cadences, cyclists can improve their ability to generate higher torque, which translates to better performance in low-speed, high-force situations like climbing or accelerating from a stop. Simulation of Strength Training: Low-cadence, high-resistance intervals on the bike can serve as an alternative or complement to gym-based strength training for improving cycling-specific strength. Cardiovascular Efficiency at Low RPMs: Some evidence suggests that low-cadence work at sub-threshold power outputs can result in lower heart rates for the same power, potentially enhancing long-term aerobic efficiency. Practical Application Structured Workouts: Low-cadence intervals (e.g., 3-5 minutes at 50-60 rpm with high resistance at 85-95% FTP) are a common way to integrate this type of training. Focus on Form: Maintaining proper pedaling technique and avoiding undue stress on the knees is critical during low-cadence training. Periodization: Incorporate low-cadence training into the offseason or base phase to build strength before transitioning to higher-cadence, race-specific training. Caveats Joint Stress: Excessive low-cadence training can strain the knees, so careful monitoring is essential. Specificity: The benefits of low-cadence training are context-dependent and might may not always directly transfer to high-cadence racing efforts. Low-cadence training can be a valuable tool in a cyclist\u2019s training arsenal but should be used strategically and in combination with other types of training for balanced development.\n\nPost 8 by Alex:\nSo I guess my final thoughts are, it\u2019s pretty fun, feels like it provides benefit, many pros do it. If you are careful and provide safe progressive overload it should make your knees stronger. Additionally there are studies that suggest it can be effective and should be especially valuable for stuff like mountain biking, sprinting and/or for people that don\u2019t like going to the gym. Likely less useful for someone that does high quality consistent leg weight training year round (it still likely is useful or at least might be useful but it\u2019s not as clear how valuable).\n\nPost 9 by LunethG:\nI have Dynamic Force workouts coming up in a few weeks. I previewed the workouts and notice the Watts in absolute terms, aren\u2019t really that hard. So I\u2019ll be turning the cranks at 50-60 rpm for 30 seconds at a wattage that I can easily hold for 60 seconds at 90 rpm (based on my 1 minute power).",

Besides the knees, which seem to be fine.\nContext: I enjoy doing some of my interval work at low cadences. A common workout I have built is 8-10min sweet spot intervals broken into alternating 2mins 90+ cadence and 2 mins 50-60 cadence.\nUser Problem: Concern about potential downsides of low cadence work.\nAnswer: Really, I think almost all coaches agree with doing various types of training and this falls far into the various category... If you do VO2max or HIIT workouts they still don\u2019t produce enough...

        "text": "Researh shows that, in general, adjusting your cadence to produce a certain power is not beneficial for amatures in terms of getting the best fitness effect from that interval. You\u2019re own prefered candene is far more effective. That doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t train cadence. I use the warm up to do cadence sessions. They don\u2019t have to be long. You can do 30 second intervals, starting at 80rpm and add 10 rpm every 30 seconds until you are bouncing on your saddle. Take one minute rest and repeat. Important is that you don\u2019t gear up. Choose a low gear and keep it there. Yes, it looks ridiculous, but it is very effective. The blocks you are doing are good to do too. I suggest you save these blocks for when you have reached a basic level of fitness that you are happy with. Use the same principle I just gave you for the high cadence, instead of gearing up, gear down and keep the speed the same so you have to use a higher cadence. The benefit of these workouts is that you will be more comfortable with different cadences. Keep up the good work. Have fun, Coach Robert\n\nPost 4 by Quinnrm:\nThanks for the helpful replies. I do believe in the usefulness of low cadence, largely because it seems like lots of top WT pros do it and I\u2019m doubt their teams would waste their time and resources on something that doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s more that I\u2019d like to hedge my bet in case it doesn\u2019t actually do anything. As in, even if it\u2019s not helping, there is no reason it\u2019s making my intervals worse. Alex: Really in the 55 range Andrea would suggest doing Z5\u2026 which is way more stressful Would you suggest a lower cadence for tempo/sweet spot? I also do some 2x15 at 80% usually around 40-45 rpm. I did build up to it, my approach was to do an outdoor ride at around Z2 on a route filled with steep punch hills about 1-2 min long (which is all we have), and do all the hills at 60-70% of ftp at around 40 rpm. After awhile I started doing the Dynamic Force intervals, which I enjoyed and thought I saw benefit from.\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nAs you know you have to always take \u201cresearch\u201d with a grain of salt as there is frequently opposing research but for sure it should be part of the conversation.

I used Erg mode but it seemeed too hard when lowering my cadence. at one point i went too low with cadence, about 25, and the resistance went so hard that i had to shift to \u201cresistance mode\u201d. Also, using resistance mode with same cadence and more wattage seemed easier than erg. I\u2019m using an Elite suito as trainer, is there something i\u2019m missing?\nContext: User is experiencing difficulty with Erg mode at low cadences.\nUser Problem: Resistance becomes too hard at low cadences in Erg mode.\nAnswer: Some trainers work better with low RPM than others, you also can try shifting to an easier gear to see if it helps a bit but if it is too easy then you wont be able hit the target watts. You just need to be very steady at these low RPMs to make sure it does not go too low as you pointed out it can become impossibly high resistance.\nSolution: Try shifting to an easier gear and maintain steady RPMs.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: That\u2019s called ERG spiral of death or lockdown. As you lower your cadence, the trainer continually adds resistance, until the force becomes so large that you cannot overcome it. 40 rpm is very low for ERG and as you say it\u2019s easy to go too low and get locked out. It\u2019s expected behaviour. If you want to do that kind of training, resistance mode is your friend indeed.\nContext: User is explaining the phenomenon of resistance increase at low cadences.\nUser Problem: Understanding the behavior of Erg mode at low cadences.\nAnswer: Some trainers work better with low RPM than others, you also can try shifting to an easier gear to see if it helps a bit but if it is too easy then you wont be able hit the target watts.

So I\u2019ll be turning the cranks at 50-60 rpm for 30 seconds at a wattage that I can easily hold for 60 seconds at 90 rpm (based on my 1 minute power). My question is do I just trust the process or is it ok to tinker with the power output for the Dynamic Force intervals and bump it up? Maybe I\u2019m getting ahead of myself and the workouts will be much harder than I imagine right now. Also, I\u2019ve noticed there are no Threshold style workouts in the plan. Which I think is a bit odd since my 2 big events that I\u2019m targeting in September are a 20 mile hill climb event and a 40k TT. I probably should\u2019ve looked deeper into the plan when CJ built it but I decided I would just trust the process and stick to it. Coming off a recovery week I decided to do both a TD Ramp test and then later in the week throw in a 4DP workout outdoors to see where I stood. What I found out most was that pacing the 20 minute effort was a challenge. Heading into a TT I should know how to pace it but with no workouts on the plan like it would be a challenge. What I\u2019m planning to do is replace my Saturday Z2/3 outdoor rides with a block of 3x10\u2019s, 3x12\u2019s, or over-unders, sandwiched between an hour-ish of Zone 2 depending on the length of the ride. It will be outdoors and I have a good area to do this. Any feedback would be appreciated.\n\nPost 10 by Alex:\nGood questions. Dynamic force is not about hard efforts they are about sustained higher torque. I would say the bigger factor if you should adjust them to be harder is how strong you are and how strong your tendons and ligaments are. If you can squat 2X your body weight then you aer very strong for example and they will be very low risk for you. If you are hard core MTBer going up steep stuff with high watts and low cadence then yes crank it up. If you are not a strength guy or MTB hill climber then you are probably better off starting with a few of these first. After the first two see how it feels. You can go to your calendar at the top and edit the plan and just change it and it will automatically update the calendar. You are absolutely correct for 40k TTer you should be doing threshold. Long ride is usually something very beneficial in general for aerobic improvement but for the last month of your peak period focusing on specificity becomes ultra important. What you can do is click on the custom plan type and select the sequences you want and replace your long ride with our threshold blocks\u2026 For this peak period consider cranking up the intensity. We still believe more in progression then doing the same super hard workouts each week but they can start your peak period as hard and move to super hard right be fore your main event.\n\nPost 11 by Robert_UCL:\nI agree with Alex. The Dynamic force should never wear you out during the training. It is just not that type of workout. You could feel it the day after, though. But different workouts wear you out in different ways. I wouldn\u2019t put the thresholds in between your zone 2. That basically destroys your zone 2 work. First, it takes a while for zone 2 to get truly effective.",

I asked a top science based cycling Coach Andrea Morelli what he thinks. His response was, \u201cIn the human body, everything is trainable. So yes, recovery should be trainable.\u201d I don\u2019t mean recovering faster. This is a different focus. This means training my body to require less recovery. It\u2019s hard to differentiate the two, but the way you approach them is very different.\n\nSo what am I saying here? Recovery adaption training is an uncharted territory but stands to provide significant benefits for us non-elite athletes. Beginners and masters athlete likely stand the most to gain.\n\n**Your Recovery Adaption Training Plan**\n\nBefore embarking on this journey, I suggest you make sure you have high-quality processes and self-awareness to know if you when you are heading down the ***over training*** path.\n\nThe point may be rather than total relaxation after a hard workout, you might get more benefit by some additional light exercise and possibly even learn how to get to the point of medium light (z2). We could call this active recovery, but the mindset of this is not to recover more/faster, you want to do that too, but the thinking behind this plan is to require less recovery. Ultimately recovering faster or requiring less recovery might end up at the same destination. A stronger better you.\n\nNext, I will create a follow-up article on ideas of how to kick start your recovery adaption training program.

I agree with @MedTechCD I would lower the intensity rather than make longer rests, but really longer rests are ok too. This is easy in our app but I not sure how you do that in Zwift or others. You can use our app to control the trainer and Zwift (or others) to ride in assuming you can connect Zwift to Ant+. In our app just press the - button to get to 110%. Also our VO2max intervals might be a bit easier at 110% in the crunched version.\n\nPost 14 by Bad_Santa:\nThanks everyone for the help, you are so great!",

        "text": "Blog Article: Your Recovery Adaption Plan\n\nIf you are the type to go out do some hard training and then think, ok now I really need to recover. I am not going to do any yard work, or take the stairs and maybe I will just sit around and watch TV or the computer/phone to recover this article is for you.\n\n![Recover faster. Mow your lawn.](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1buEm22l1iqB7MhS0qRxhWA.jpg)\n\nThe endurance world has for the most part accepted the idea of managing training stress. This is important if you are serious about performance, health and/or over-training.\n\nAdvanced endurance athletes use the TrainingPeaks PMC chart, a Whoop device or possibly heart rate variability (HRV) to manage their recovery. The problem is all these methods are very hit or miss for most people. I would argue managing training stress is more art than science.\n\nMath based training stress such as PMC can get you in the ball park especially if you are doing high volume training and that is the main stress factor in your life. Most people that get a Whoop and are serious about training ignore when it tells them not to train.\n\nI would argue that when you train hard you should recover, but I would also argue that if you want to recover better, forcing your body to recover following less optimum than optimum recovery practices can bring large benefits when done right. The problem is that for many people doing it right is likely a razors edge.\n\n**Meet Recovery Adaption Training\u200a\u2014**\u200aThe idea is move more to train more. There are a few key target audiences for this\n\n*   I don\u2019t have time to do a proper build phase and increase my training hours gradually before my target event or season. In many cases this means late winter / spring.\n*   I don\u2019t like to do lots of hours on an indoor trainer but when outdoor season comes I want to immediately ride as much as possible.\n*   Even when I build slowly once I get to X hours per week or Y days per week I start to fall apart.\n*   I want to get bad ass and I willing to be a little risky\n\n* * *\n\nBecause we are advocating training more to push the limits on your training, instead of more recovery this requires very tight control and/or self awareness.\n\nMowing the lawn is stress, digging is lots of stress, cross training is stress, even walking is low grade stress. Because the science has not caught up with this idea yet there are no studies comparing the efficiency of this but we all know the best athletes tend to train a lot. They recover in adverse cases. For the most part they do put sleep as a very, very high priority. If you can sleep a lot, eat reasonable most of the time, you have the core of recovery handled. Now you need to make burning other calories a part of both building endurance as well as recovering.\n\nYou need to experiment on your own. Try slowly doing, more and more. Count steps if you need to. Stop sitting as much as possible. Break up sitting by moving as often as you can. On a side note sit with good posture (neutral spine).\n\nIf you take this on and start to see patterns like waking in the night and having trouble sleeping, irritability, bad Whoop/HRV readings, your training performance declines. Pay close attention. If you can become good at high volumes of work, even if it is not on the bike, your body is stronger. Count calorie expenditure. Whoop seems pretty good at this. Build up to 6,000 calories a day 4/5 days a week. Even if that is only 6-hours a week of actual training. Variety helps. Weight training, rowing, other cross training. Yoga\u2026. Move more. Require less recovery. Get strong, and skinny (if you need to).",

But generally, you want to start with something that feels hard and end with something that feels very hard. just be careful and pay attention to signs of any kind of over training.\n\nPost 18 by Trx:\nI understand you for the 8-12 weeks but the race is in 5 weeks so what do you recommend for this short period? but in these months I have already done several v02max workouts this year here let\u2019s say that I\u2019m not a beginner, but now I want to try to do the 1 minute repetitions at 150% ftp and see what happens\n\nPost 19 by Trx:\nScreenshot_20250529_120412_Chrome1080\u00d7656 86.4 KB\n\nPost 20 by Alex:\nLooks good.

I\u2019m looking simple how-to guide for those of use that have a fixed gear bike and how to get things setup and working correctly. I think I need a method to set the cadence without gear shifting. Is there a control within the app to do this? For example if I want to train at 125w with a cadence of 60rpm can I adjust things to allow? Thanks for any help\nContext: New user with a fixed gear bike looking for setup guidance\nUser Problem: Unclear how to set cadence without gear shifting\nAnswer: This is how ERG mode works, it automatically controls effort/power based on your target, so you can pedal any cadence you want and the effort will either be easy or hard. Now that said it\u2019s possible that your fixie is not the perfect gearing so you can\u2019t go easy enough but if you are reasonably strong then it\u2019s unlikely that is a problem. Just notice if you have an easy target and it won\u2019t go as easy as prescribed automatically then that could be the reason. I have never done the math and don\u2019t know your exact gearing but I would not be surpirized if 50watts or something is not the easiest but for most, this is fine. I am not sure how this works from a cassette standpoint meaning you need a cassette that will mount to your Saris but also has the same tooth size as the chain on your bike. Maybe this is not a problem in general. I know Zwift Ride solves this problem at some level but I don\u2019t know if that works on the Saris.\nSolution: Use ERG mode to control effort/power based on target\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thank you Alex, I will give the ERG mode a try. The difficulty I am having with the workouts is mostly in the warmup mode. It gives me a very light target like 50w in my case. The result is hard to describe, almost like the flywheel is running too fast for the load and I get a \u201cclunk clunk\u201d as the pedal force engages the load, almost impossible to avoid even with very careful smooth pedaling. Not sure if i succeeded in describing? Mechanically, connecting the Saris to the bike its just a matter of alignment with spacers, and using the same size cog as you suggest.

Anyway, I can\u2019t say how much better TR adaptive is then their old plans. Coach Jack old school actually requires less adaptivity. Also I think self managment of adaptivity is totally reasonable and approachable. If you feel like you have a demanding life and need more flexibity rather than using our calendar, push a CJ plan to \u201cMy Plans\u201d and activate it there. Then it is a sequence of workouts. Once a sequence of workouts on an off day you can grab another workout from your library, like a recovery ride and just keep working through the sequence to the end. CJ workouts start at a very manageble level and you can use our ride feel to further adjust the intensity.

You can move intensity slider up manually and adjust ride feel up, but unless you really tweak these up we attempt to start easy and by the end it can get reasonably hard or very hard depending on how much tweaking you do.

        "text": "Blog Article: Improving FTP\n\nYou can search the internet and find lots of reasons why focusing on improving your FTP is a bad idea. I should say it\u2019s not the worst thing but frequently it drives the wrong behavior and can take the fun out of cycling.\n\nFor many of us seeing progress is inspirational and keeps us motivated. That is one big benefit of FTP improvements. We think being motivated or at least consistent is the most important factor in performance cycling and health in general.\n\nThe bad part of putting so much focus on FTP is a few things. When you start to see FTP based progress, you think this is the best training there is. Hard/long sweet spot training can show some great results in short term FTP improvements for example. The problem is FTP is just a test, although in general your FTP or FTP watts per kilogram does relate to performance, specific goal based training and a wide variety of training produces better overall seasonal results. Also it\u2019s very important to look at seasonal improvements not just short term FTP boosts. If you are continuously trying to boost your FTP, it will flatline. I think almost everyone realizes that periodization is important but then many don\u2019t do a very good job of seasonal variety. Your FTP should drop down a bit and then build back up to new highs.\n\nAlso FTP tests have an anaerobic contribution so even short term sprint work will improve a ramp test for example but is likely not doing that much for your aerobic system. Aerobic changes come slowly over a long period of time.\n\nAlso when people are focused on FTP improvement, doing Zone 2 heart rate is very scary. They can feel they are not as strong and trying to do sustained threshold feels painful, oh my I am losing everything. But those that have the mental power to make it through a late fall / early winter of Zone 2 come out in peak form in the late spring with tons of motivation and realize this is the way forward.\n\nAnyway, this is all very personal and depends on your circumstances and goals. FTP focused improvements can make sense.\n\nTaking the cycling camp approach of a short 10 day boot camp period with doing cycling workouts everyday can cause some rapid boosts but this approach is not sustainable long term.",

        "text": "Forum Q&A: Question about FTP\nCategory: Training Execution\nTopic Type: Training Execution\n\nQ&A 1:\nQuestion: Hi all, I\u2019m a new Trainer Day user and I usually train with FulGaz. I did the FulGaz FTP Test some weeks ago with a result of 193. FulGaz considers the 95% of it (183). That\u2019s the value (183) I entered yesterday to create a 12 Weeks Training Plan. Should I keep it during the all 12 weeks or should I do more FTP Tests after some weeks?\nContext: User is new to Trainer Day and has experience with FulGaz.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about whether to retest FTP during the training plan.\nAnswer: If you are fairly new to riding and feel like you are improving significantly you can test again each month or 6 weeks but in most cases you could wait to the end without a problem.\nSolution: Test again each month or 6 weeks if improving significantly; otherwise, wait until the end.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thanks a lot. If I decide to do another test in one or two months and get a higher value, what should I do with the training plan?\nContext: User is considering retesting FTP in the future.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about how to adjust the training plan based on a new FTP value.\nAnswer: Nothing. If you are using our app to train with it will automatically scale when you update your FTP.\nSolution: The app will automatically scale when FTP is updated.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: I was trying to upload my plan to TrainingPeaks in order to automatically see the Workout of the day in Fulgaz but\u2026I think I made a mess. Right now all my workouts are in TrainingPeaks but all of them are scheduled in the same day (Nov 25) and there\u2019s nothing in FulGaz. I also manually uploaded the zwo files to FG but they seems \u201cempty\u201d.\nContext: User is experiencing issues with syncing workouts to FulGaz.\nUser Problem: Workouts not appearing correctly in FulGaz after uploading to TrainingPeaks.\nAnswer: Yes you need to use our calendar not use upload to TP. You must have paid TP account to upload to TP and have them show up on the right day. It should show up in Fullgaz pretty quick but if you have all workouts on one day that might be a problem. You should just have one workout on today\u2019s calendar and then check in fullgaz after some time.\nSolution: Use TrainerDay's calendar instead of uploading to TrainingPeaks.\n\nQ&A 4:\nQuestion: It sounds good! Thank you. What happens to an uploaded workout if I can\u2019t do it the scheduled day? Can I postpone it to the next day?\nContext: User is inquiring about rescheduling workouts.\nUser Problem: Concern about missing scheduled workouts.\nAnswer: Yes you can\nSolution: You can postpone the workout to the next day.\n\nQ&A 5:\nQuestion: Which FTP value do you recommend that I enter in TD? The actual one I got with the test (193) or 95% (183) as FulGaz requested?\nContext: User is unsure about which FTP value to use.\nUser Problem: Confusion about which FTP value to enter in TrainerDay.\nAnswer: It\u2019s not important from a Coach Jack or our platform perspective. It matters more in what you set your FTP at in FulGaz. I am installing it now to test how FulGaz works in ERG mode since I can\u2019t seem to find the answer. I am sure it works based on percent so if you increase your FTP in FulGaz it will increase your target watts for your workout. You can test this also. Just start a workout, see the target watts. Stop, Increase your FTP a lot and then start the same workout again and see if the watts went up. If you are doing Coach Jack workouts they start out easy enough and build in a fashion that either FTP is fine.",

        "text": "Blog Article: Designing The Perfect Interval Workout Using W'bal\n\n#### Starting with Progressive Overload\n\nAs most of you likely know, one of the key fundamentals of exercise is progressive overload. This means if you want to get stronger you need to go to failure or at least close to failure to tell your body it needs to repair itself and get stronger so next time this same exercise is easy.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0xYyOCvibyEmEczap.jpg)\n\n### How many intervals should I be\u00a0doing?\n\nEveryone knows that they have a limited amount of time, that they can sustain a hard-effort. We can clarify hard-effort as anything above your FTP. But how much time is that exactly? Meaning should I do four 2-minutes intervals @ 120% or maybe they should be 2:15 not 2-minutes. Since each athlete has a unique amount of anaerobic capacity (W\u2019). You should train with custom intervals matched to your personal W\u2019. You can hunt by trial and error, or you can use this cool TrainerDay feature called W\u2019 Balance (W\u2019Bal). This same feature has been in GoldenCheetah for a long time, but we feel we simplified it.\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0ysY46bOrDhfas0UX.jpg)\n\n### Finding the perfect interval\u00a0workouts\n\nThis is a fairly deep subject but just starting with the basics is a huge step forward and something that many workout authors overlook. So for this article we are talking about intervals above your FTP. You want to tax your anaerobic system with just the right stimulus.\n\nThe basic idea is when you are above FTP your anaerobic work capacity (AWC or W\u2019) diminishes. Many people also call this \u201cburning matches.\u201d You only have so many matches to burn. Although when you drop below your FTP your W\u2019 recovers, or the match book fills back up, slowly. The great news is we have added W\u2019Bal to our workout creator.\n\n### 5000+ Is Too Many\u00a0Choices\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0WVmL4pI8fTbu_xpU.jpg)\n\n![](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-0aQCWEwrcemsHW-_X.png)\n\nI would like to point out, I don\u2019t feel a 10-minute warm-up is enough, it should be closer to 20. It just improved the visibility in this example.\n\n### How to use the W\u2019Bal Calculator\n\nTurn on the W\u2019Bal feature. Enter your FTP or if you know it your CP in the CP box. Enter your W\u2019 ([how to calculate](https://trainerday.com/how-to-calculate-your-critical-power-cp-and-w/)) and you are good to go.\n\nThe red line shows you\u2019re predicted remaining energy and you can see at the end of this set of intervals your remaining energy is at the bottom this W\u2019Bal predicts you are completly fatigued at the end of the intervals. Perfect.\n\nMany scientific studies have proven the validity of these formulas.\n\nIn this example on the left, if you have a W\u2019 of 20kJ, and a FTP of 200, with those intervals, you will burn all your matches. The interesting thing is if you had a 300w FTP, you could not complete this workout (read [[2023-01-01-why-ftp-based-training-is-half-wrong-cdc48b62baeb.md|this article]] to find out why).

        "text": "Forum Q&A: Z2 base++ plan - why is it so difficult!\nCategory: Training Execution\nTopic Type: Training Execution\n\nQ&A 1:\nQuestion: So I just completed a 4 week Base++ plan and almost every single ride was quite tough (a different kind of tough from sweet spot training that I did on trainerroad before), I was surprised as I thought the idea was it would be easy to build my base/foundation but perhaps that was a misnomer? After completing my sweet spot program on trainerroad and seeing a raise in my FTP, I moved over to trainerday and did the base++ as mentioned. I find that while I do sit in the z2 heart rate zones, when doing the longer and \u201charder\u201d intervals (13 minutes sometimes!!!) that I am on the upper end of Z2 HR and maybe ~65-75% FTP. Is this\u2026 Normal? I find it very difficult to push through some of the intervals without taking a break and I am not even riding that long\u2026 60-75 minute rides.\nContext: User transitioned from TrainerRoad to TrainerDay and is comparing experiences.\nUser Problem: Difficulty in completing intervals and unexpected intensity of the Base++ plan.\nAnswer: This is not normal. Maybe you increased the intensity a lot and did not realize it? Here is what base++ should look like at the default intensity level image2412\u00d71084 243 KB Most of it is 60% other than the short HIIT. Some times it gets up to 70%. Your ride feel/intensity should look like this by default unless you changed it. image1396\u00d71438 266 KB\nSolution: Check the intensity settings and adjust if necessary.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: So the program does look like that, except the fact that I split the rides to 4 days/week and only have 4 hours a week since being on the saddle is just absolute torture at my current fitness. It does seem the intensity was adjusted, I take it this was something I did myself (I don\u2019t remember) as I was likely trying to emulate the feeling from what I was doing on trainerroad (albeit it was a different type of training program altogether)? I should also note that it is true that the majority of the ride is lower than 60% of FTP but even for the long intervals at that FTP, the fatiguing does kick in (burn and wanting to stop but very different from I have nothing left to give \u2018e.g. doing an FTP test\u2019). I was always under the impression that with Z2 training I could just spin indefinitely but I am always more than happy to finish a one hour Z2 ride from the base++ program every single time!\nContext: User is adjusting their training schedule and reflecting on their experience.\nUser Problem: Struggling with the intensity and duration of the Base++ plan.\nAnswer: Yes you chose a bit tired but do-able and you chose base++ which is the hardest base plan\u2026 that combination makes it not easy. And as you said, you are a bit tired but do-able. It\u2019s closer to true zone 2 if you change that down to the lowest setting. People are different also. One time a guy came here that could ride sweet spot all day long because he had a strange case that sweet spot for him was zone 2 heart rate. So based on how you are are sounding I think it should be set to \u201cI feel like I could do more than that.\u201d True zone 2 and base should be able to be done all day, but in that case it would be better to use our HR+ mode and set it to about 65-70% of max HR (Find your AeT)\u2026 then you are doing real zone 2.\nSolution: Adjust the intensity settings and consider using HR+ mode.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Thank you for your response! It makes sense. I will look into doing the zone test but can you please advise which test that is to make sure I\u2019m doing it correctly.\nContext: User is seeking clarification on the zone test.",

And I don\u2019t know if we have advanced that much since 2015 in lab testing of LT1, VT1, and RQ. I realize home tests have advanced infinitely. I also realize you are thinking (and others are saying) lactate aligns with VT1 which means either that Maffetone was just wrong, or his lactate tests were inaccurate. I just have not been able to find clear evidence of what you are saying is true but maybe it exists (you got anything?) I see evidence indicating it for lt2/vt2 accuracy. I have no idea if Maffetone is right or not it just the data dispelling his suggestion looks pretty fuzzy to me at this point. I have also seen many graphs like this below. Which it would be pretty hard to say 2.0 is the actual turn point. Really in this example it more clearly starts going up either at 1.9 or 2.2 not 2.0. image717\u00d7452 23.7 KB Just search google images and you see all kinds of different graphs and each look enough different that while 2.0 might be an average and semi reasonable predictor, it might be likely saying 220-age is a reasonable predictor. I don\u2019t know if what I am saying is true. I just threw this idea out there as a discussion point. I know you have researched this more than me. I am just presenting what I see. I am trying to meet with Andrea on this too. I pretty sure at Mapei they test all 3 markers on the pros and have been for 20+ years so he might have some additional insight. I am not sure if they actually cared that much about LT1 / VT1 though but he might have some additional graphs or thoughts on this.\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nNot to throw any other wrench in this but Coggan says in recent interview it is all BS and their is no LT1 turn point it\u2019s just a continuum. He talks very good but I think he can come to the wrong conclusion at times\u2026 (can\u2019t we all) After what I call his TSS/sweet spot failure, in general don\u2019t use his advice for the most part but I am sure he is right in many things. He seemed to be dispelling this Zone 2 training at some level or that was my interpretation of what he was saying. But I say TSS failure, I think it was a success really but it just turned the wrong way.\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nNow I have no idea if SMO2 means anything, but the guys at Moxy thinks it really can be accurate for VT1 (in some individuals). And I can say the first turn point is incredibly obvious in my testing. Here is an example. You can see oxygen levels dropping like a rock at ~130bpm. image912\u00d7818 97.2 KB So at least their is no question where the turn point is.\n\nPost 6 by MedTechCD:\nTo be clear, I am 100% in agreement that the most exact way of identifying the fat-burn zone is with RQ. But I mentioned quite some disadvantages like cost and knowledge of protocol to use. Let\u2019s face it, if you go to a lab for sports oriented testing, the N\u00b0 1 priority for the testing facility is sadly still to make money with it\u2026 I am in hospitals daily as a service technician for diagnostic equipment and the most important thing is that the device \u2018functions\u2019, as in \u2018spitting out a document\u2019 that proofs that the exam was done.

It seems like i was able to talk the same at 131. Anyway, garmin zone 2 is 128-143. so right now TD is giving me zone 1. now if i look at the zone with Whoop, i am in zone 2 (60-69%). Is garmin computing zone 2 wrong ? which data should i follow ?\nContext: User is comparing heart rate data from TrainerDay, Garmin, and Whoop.\nUser Problem: Confusion about which heart rate data to trust for zone training.\nAnswer: It\u2019s not \u201cbe able to talk\u201d it\u2019s notice a small change in the way you talk or the way you breath from absolutely normal conversation to slightly more effort. It\u2019s definitely closer to 126. Glad you like the feature.\nSolution: Clarified the definition of zone 2 and confirmed the user's target HR.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: What about the zone discrepancy with garmin ? It tells me that zone 2 starts at 128 when 65% of my max hr is 126. Are garmin zone wrong ?\nContext: User is questioning the accuracy of Garmin's zone calculations.\nUser Problem: Discrepancy in heart rate zones between TrainerDay and Garmin.\nAnswer: Maffetone is 180-age \u00b1 extras not max hr-age. So this makes them exactly the same.\nSolution: Provided clarification on the Maffetone formula and its relation to heart rate zones.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Thanks Alex. Got the info. The thing is i am not sure it will work for me. I also need to check my max HR again. Right now, if i use his method, i would get 193-59+5 =139. 65% of 193 is 126. so there is a big difference. I think 139 may be too much if i am supposed to stay in a low intensity workout.\nContext: User is expressing uncertainty about the applicability of the Maffetone method to their situation.\nUser Problem: Concern about the appropriateness of the calculated target HR for low-intensity workouts.\nAnswer: So my suggestion is to go \u201cdeep Maffetone\u201d which means 4/5 days a week or more of 100% zone 2, even 7 days a week is good. Do this for 60-100 workouts.\nSolution: Recommended a consistent training approach using the Maffetone method.",

You can just search Maffetone 180 or ask chatGPT to understand his test.\n\nPost 9 by MedTechCD:\nRobert_UCL: However, if your Threshold is already 146, you have a good aerobic base. Keep that up. I was going to say the exact same thing. If the lab test was done correctly and the measuring devices were calibrated, the test results should be trusted. VT1 sits at an RER of ~0.80 and VT2 at RER=1. And RER (respiratory exchange rate = respiratory quotient = VCO2/VO2) is much more reliable then lactate testing (if the MET cart is functioning correctly). But I am surprised that an LT1 at 146 comes out with a HRmax at 184. Or is this 184, the max during the test and not your true max HR? Elite riders can have a VT1 that is very close to VT2 (only about 10-15bpm separate), but that is the result of many years of consistent training and a volume that you can only get to if you are a pro. If you are in that case, training at VT1 is clearly hard work. Your cardiovascular system has been trained to achieve that result, but the strain on the muscle system is high at such an output. If you want AeT efficiency, and decoupling calculated for you, use Intervals.icu. It has those parameters by default analysed. The Power/HR quotient is something you can use for the entire aerobic zone as a \u2018sub-max\u2019 test. It allows to follow up progress without doing an all out FTP test. Check decoupling for the duration of the events you\u2019re targeting. If you have significant decoupling after 2 hours, you\u2019re not ready to go ride a Grand Fondo of 5-6 hours. Check both efficiency and decoupling at different intensities below VT2.\n\nPost 10 by BlackTek:\nThank you @Robert_UCL and @Alex - I really appreciate your feedbacks. I\u2019ll do the test tomorrow early morning (wake-up at 04:15 am to finish by 7am and bring kids at school :)) I\u2019ll do the test like this: I\u2019ve verified from past the last workout that my bpm is normally quite low until I start going above 70% FTP. Last Saturday it was 130bpm at 78% ftp (over 5 minutes after 15 minutes warm-up) After the AeT I\u2019ll do my next workout from CJ (I\u2019ll just skip first cooldown and second warmup to stay in more or less 2 hours): image812\u00d7424 20 KB I\u2019ll share the results, perhaps a nice discussion to elaborate the results will start. Probably this weekend I\u2019ll do another FTP test after the first 2 months of training. Thank you again!\n\nPost 11 by BlackTek:\ndo you think it\u2019s ok to do the test without breakfast and just an espresso coffee? Coffee might impact HR a bit, but I take 6-7 per day, so it\u2019s part of my regular schedule. Probably better to don\u2019t ingest carbs or other things. For me it\u2019s fine to do like that for all AeT tests (and in the end it\u2019s better to avoid sugars around, to give a stronger signal to the body to use fat, despite 80\u2019 test is really short)\n\nPost 12 by Alex:\nIt\u2019s sounding like you have a very good aerobic base 5-time Ironman winner Mark Allen followed low hr training and when his base was very strong he would do intervals at AeT because it was not easy. I experienced this to some degree as well about 12 years ago. Would love to hear your test results but if you have a very optimized aerobic system you may not see a ton of progress.

I forgot to switch on the second fan, I did at the start of the third segment, and you see that power went up. I\u2019ve drunk water every 2 intervals (every 10 minutes) The breathing was not like walking, it was ok, I surely was able to talk, but surely not like resting / easy walking. It was harder to keep 180w steady on the HT, the thing I dislike is that you never rest/pause/coast like on a real bike But it was ok. Yes, I focused on deep breadths, and tried to be constand with rpm (but not a perfect job with rpm). I did the test without breakfast, and I also forgot my espresso I think that at 130bpm is not taxing enough, and the stimolous is not very good (in terms of training). But this is still unknown territory for me. In terms of power it was low-Z3 for me. How to understand/decide if it\u2019s better to ride at lower/higher bpm to train aerobic endurance? The decoupling was good, so surely it was exclusively aerobic work. Right?",

My assumption is that, in a loop, it increases HT resistence by few points and wait something like 30 seconds to see the delayed effects on the HR - is it more or less like that? If it\u2019s like that I expect to arrive in Z3/Z4 before seeing my HR at 135, and after that it will lower the resistence. Never used such mode, just guessing Moreover if I set hr target in a shorter interval it will increase the HT resistence more aggressively/quickly, right?\n\nPost 15 by Alex:\nYes basically as you describe but for many people to when the get on the bike and just have 135 set for example it takes about 10 minutes to get them to 135 so it is pretty slow\u2026 It changes a small amount every 30 seconds\u2026 I don\u2019t remember the exact rules but that is the concept. But what it does it take your previous 30 seconds power level and adjust from there so if you do ERG warmup, you can get your HR to build up faster and then it will just start from the last ERG power\u2026 So in reality you could just click on quick start and click on HR+ and set to 135\u2026 you don\u2019t even need a workout. It should remember this 135 but right now that when you restart the app it forgets but we will fix that soon. But no short intervals it will not more aggressively increase, it is always slow so ERG is the way to get it to move faster.\n\nPost 16 by BlackTek:\nok clear; tnx. I thought it was more or less like that, for this reason I put an initial interval in erg mode. Maybe it\u2019s an idea/suggestion to take into account the interval duration and the distance from the current HR to the target HR and increase the resistence slower/faster - basically calculating a gradient\n\nPost 17 by Alex:\nYes and soon it will put you target watts at 1200w to get your hr up 40 bpm in 5 minutes\u2026 no I prefer the safe route and let users do their own custom erg ramps.\n\nPost 18 by BlackTek:\nHello AeT test made!

Because accuracy **does NOT affect your training** it does not need to be perfectly accurate but will improve your experience a little by setting the right scaling in our app. Also at the bottom we show your target % of threshold rather than your target of maximum heart rate. If you have your threshold heart rate set accurately. You can just set your target to 80% and that should be a reasonable Zone 2 target as well.\n\n**The best way to determine your target Zone 2 heart rate**\n\n![Zone 2 Heart Rate test using ERG mode on a smart trainer](https://shared-web.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/images/2024-03-1lwv9_NqmII0sExACjPhegA.png)\n\nHere is a link to that workout.

        "text": "Forum Discussion: Some boring Coach Jack Z2 workouts :-(\nCategory: Category 9\nTopic Type: Training Execution\nPosts: 16\n\nPost 1 by framgn:\nIt\u2019s probably my fault because I set Coach Jack up wrong, but the plan he created for me has too many boring workouts. Today, for example, it was a long flat endless 60 minutes ride, which I spent playing with my smartphone. I felt like I wasted 75 minutes doing nothing, for the fourth week in a row. I have to create a new plan in the hope of better understanding how it works. 7 min @ 40% 3 min @ 60% 5 min @ 60% 5 min @ 66% 5 min @ 67% 2 min @ 65% 5 min @ 66% 1 min @ 72% 5 min @ 65% 1 min @ 70% 5 min @ 60% 5 min @ 66% 5 min @ 67% 2 min @ 65% 5 min @ 66% 1 min @ 72% 5 min @ 65% 1 min @ 70% 2 min @ 50% What is the purpose or benefit of doing 3 minutes at 60% followed by 5 minutes at 60% again? Or 5 minutes at 66% then 5 minutes at 67% and again 2 minutes at 66%?\n\nPost 2 by dthrog00:\nIf I understand correctly the zone 2 rides are randomly assigned to different structures (Kerfuffle, Collywobbles, Fard, etc\u2026). I think these are done so a 60 minute zone 2 ride isn\u2019t a 7 minute warmup followed by 48 minutes at 65% and then a 5 minute cool down. You may want a custom CJ plan that doesn\u2019t have zone 2 rides or to change the ride feel to make it harder. Dave\n\nPost 3 by Alex:\nYep this is typical endurance rides from a power perspective. We are not pure polarized believers but follow a similar belief system that most of your rides should be easy. But yes you should be able to tweak CJ to get it exactly like you like it. Like stated create a custom plan with 3 workouts of your choice and don\u2019t put them 2 days in a row and you won\u2019t get any zone 2 if you don\u2019t want it. If you need harder just crank up the intensity slider. Just remember hard winters followed by hard springs and summers usually lead to burn out. So in a typical racer periodization fashion winter should be preparing you for a harder spring. Everything in training is very individual and requires some personal experimentation and adjustments to fully match your desires and life. We always suggest doing what is fun as long as it does not compromise your health (too much).\n\nPost 4 by framgn:\nI don\u2019t want 2-3 months of hard workouts, but I don\u2019t want 2-3 months of too easy workouts either. I think I\u2019ll do an intense month of January, followed by February in Z2 with maybe some peaks in Z3 or some hard reps. Then I\u2019ll have to think about what to do in March as the last month of indoor workouts. Maybe it\u2019ll be a mix.\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nYeah it\u2019s not traditional if you want a spring peak but at the same time, I like non-traditional It sounds like you are getting some recovery/base periods within the year so I think you are setting yourself up for fun and performance rather than burnout which is most important!\n\nPost 6 by framgn:\nI like working out without getting bored and hoping not to lose fitness\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nBored sucks!!! Have fun!!!\n\nPost 8 by Sport_IT_Diederik:\nLast winter I did mainly Z2 rides. Is it boring? well, Netflix helps.",

As an example - I run a custom warmup before doing any workouts. Immediately after I want to go into my main (separate) workout if I could queue them up. I currently finish my warmup \u201cworkout\u201d then start my main \u201cworkout\u201d. Is it possible to queue them up? As I currently run them, I get two Strava entries and have to go digging to find the workout after the warmup is done (I use iOS and if I have it scrolled down to the workout, once I go back after the warmup it\u2019ll lose my place on the workouts tab). Thanks!\nContext: User runs a custom warmup before main workouts.\nUser Problem: Having to start the main workout manually after the warmup and losing place in the app.\nAnswer: As @MedTechCD suggested. We have a merge feature, start one workout and while pedalling on the last segment just select the next work out and it will append it t the end of this right after the current segment. It will create 1 workout from as many as you want in Strava and everywhere.\nSolution: Use the merge feature to append workouts.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Because I slightly modulate endurance targets. In ERG mode, doing the exact same wattage for long periods is boring\u2026 I know, you will say that I could use slope mode and regulate myself, but I usually watch TV while doing this and I don\u2019t want to focus on my wattage.\nContext: User prefers to modulate endurance targets while watching TV.\nUser Problem: Boredom with constant wattage in ERG mode.\nAnswer: Nope, cool. Just making sure you were not missing something. All good. I think your plan is a good one. I think ERG is perfect in this case.\nSolution: Acknowledged the user's approach as valid.",

I\u2019m disappointed that there isn\u2019t more variety and that there are no cadence targets. I hope that I\u2019m missing something and that someone has a suggestion. Thanks!\nContext: User has experience with other training platforms and is looking for more engaging workouts.\nUser Problem: Boredom with workouts and lack of variety.\nAnswer: We have 38,000 workouts and you can\u2019t find any variety? You can also search by cadence targets. I realize you are probably referring to coach Jack. I would suggest you do a custom coach jack plan and use some of the block variants. But there is no reason you can throw in some variety from our workout database. With Coach Jack we focus more on the raw fundamentals of training rather than the entertainment value, and I realize that is not the most exciting. In reality higher intensity is more exciting, at least it does not give you time to get bored. So I guess this is the long answer to the fact that this is not as polished from an entertainment standpoint as those platforms are.\nSolution: Suggested using custom Coach Jack plans and exploring the workout database for variety.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Hi Alex, with all due respect, I disagree with your statement about \u201centertainment or exciting value\u201d of cadence targets. Very weird way of thinking and as a coach, never heard of it before. Actually, with power meters so popular, cadence drills are very neglected. The best performing cyclists are able to maintain high power AND high rpms. It is a FUNDAMENTAL training ability to work on and in development categories, it is absolutely necessary since gearing are limited. Also, able to use higher cadence means you solicit less muscular which brings less fatigue.\nContext: User is a coach and emphasizes the importance of cadence drills.\nUser Problem: Disagreement with Alex's view on cadence drills.\nAnswer: No problem I like the discussion. You are absolutely right that top pro and elite cyclists tend to have a higher cadence than average. Not universally true but on it\u2019s common in modern times. But\u2026 It has been shown that most people can sustain the most power for the longest period of time at their natural cadence. And never been proven that riding at higher than your natural cadence will produce better results (and to some degree the opposite has been \u201cproven\u201d). It\u2019s also shown that doing cadence drills tends to have a small impact on natural cadence unless done over a very long period of time. That said, if you are at the top of your performance level trying to squeeze out that last 2-5% out of your performance than cadence drills for sure can make a difference. So my entertainment statement is a bit of an exaggeration. But to my argument very few of us are at a level that this matters, so this is why I put cadence drills as entertainment or skills work not a critical performance enhancement. This is a good friend of mine and ex-pro cyclist and while his message is different than what I am suggesting if you read between the lines the message is similar. The point I take from his message is that for amateur cyclists improving their cardiovascular system which is likely best done via Zone 2 training (the general belief these days) and from that you may be in a better position to pedal a bit faster and take benefit from a little higher cadence especially in long events. So it\u2019s not that I am against cadence work for incremental improvement, it\u2019s just significantly more important to focus on training. So much so that it\u2019s very optional for anyone not at their personal peak performance but if you enjoy it, have fun. So I don\u2019t consider it a base level fundamental to performance but I do plan to add some cadence drills to Coach Jack in the future. For both entertainment and potential incremental gains. FYI - The woman that recently won the world record for 1 hour did it at something around 65 rpm.\nSolution: Plans to add cadence drills to Coach Jack in the future.",

FYI - The woman that recently won the world record for 1 hour did it at something around 65 rpm.\n\nPost 8 by Alex:\nIt\u2019s obvious the guy that rides 2 hours a week at 100rpm is very unlikely to beat a previously similar level rider that rides 8 hours a week at 60rpm. (extreme example) I would argue that for any individual if they do the right workouts, recovery and volume management, they will be significantly better off that if that same individual neglects one of those 3 and instead does lots of cadence work. Meaning it has a much smaller impact. I am not saying that it has no impact. Most people don\u2019t get those top 3 correct (pro cyclists do them right as much as possible within their crazy schedules). Again I am not arguing if it is valuable or not, more just that it is not a key fundamental to training and naturally most people are going to have some level of cadence variance in different types of training. So just randomly throwing in a bit of sustained cadence variance on your own would give most of us, \u201c80%\u201d of the benefit of specific cadence drills.\n\nPost 9 by Steve_sirico:\nCreate your own workouts. It\u2019s easy and you can set target range for cadence, watts and hr. I think it\u2019s supposed to be boring. Teaches discipline. It prepares you for riding on the road. I\u2019ve never seen it as an end unto itself. I enjoy finding my limits with my own workouts.",

It would seem it is something to do with your tablet is my guess but hard to say at this point. image960\u00d71280 258 KB\n\nPost 13 by Alex:\nSorry I see no one responded to you. Slope mode has a funny relationship to power just like outdoor slope to power. Generally people go harder up hill but it\u2019s not a clear relationship as to how much harder. If it is 60-minutes at 5% they will output different power than 30-seconds at 5%. So really it depends on your goals and how much you want to shift. If you want to try to hit your target watts in slope mode it depends on your gearing so it\u2019s a bit of trial and error. I would mostly play around with target slopes that are similar to outdoor slopes 2-8% range typically.\n\nPost 14 by HighSpeed:\nNever saw this post until now. SB20 Power Sources There are two ways to get power data from the SB20: \u201cStages Bike SB20\u201d Left Crank The left crank is the source for power data. The SB20 bike relays power data it gets from the left crank. Left crank is special: it also gets data from the right crank and sends combined L:R data with its power data updates. You should try connecting only to the SB20 Bike for both bike control and power. If you start having problems like missing data, you should connect the SB20 Bike for bike control and your left crank for power. Connection Restrictions You need to track how you connect to devices (Ant+ or Bluetooth) and how many times. In general, IOS and Android devices user Bluetooth. Bike computers, like Garmin, use Ant+. PCs and Mac use Bluetooth and occasionally Ant+ with a special dongle.",

Also now it easier for new coach jack users to realize they can control the hour limits on each day, just a bit faster and easier to set. See below.

Se vc fizer intervalos fortes nos primeiros 30 min e depois um bloco de 30 min em Z2 o resultado do IF ser\u00e1 distribu\u00eddo nos 60 min. Que seria o resultado do treino total. Mas seria interessante visualizar at\u00e9 onde foi o IF nos primeiros 30 min de treino intenso. TSS seria mais para acompanhar se est\u00e1 adequado a programa\u00e7\u00e3o do treino planejado. Com rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao TSS e IF x KJ e Calorias, sinceramente nunca vi um planejamento de treinos com foco em Calorias. O proprio CJ demonstra a intensidade dos treinos por IF e TSS e nem informa a KJ e Calorias de um planejamento completo de treino. Calorias \u00e9 o resultado de um treino com foco em ENDURANCE, THRESHOLD, ANAEROBIC, TEMPO, etc\u2026 que s\u00e3o diretamente vinculados a intensidade (IF) dos treinos. Mas fique a vontade de desenvolver como achar melhor. Isso \u00e9 somente minha vis\u00e3o e minha experi\u00eancia com v\u00e1rios treinadores que j\u00e1 tive. A tela do TD para PC atualmente me atende bem.\n\nPost 10 by Alex:\nI do TSS and IF in Coach Jack because this is what users expect But also as I said it makes sense for planning. It gives a way to modulate intensity and duration reasonably accurate enough. Calories and KJ are more something you monitor during a workout not when planning. That is why they make more sense on this screen. During the workout IF / TSS makes less sense. If a person is doing dynamic training and not following a plan and trying to know in real-time. Now that said like you are saying is each person is different. If you are closely following IF/TSS then having real time calculations might be something you like / appreciate. I am not completely against them even if I personally don\u2019t see as much value. Let\u2019s think about it longer\u2026 I appreciate you always giving feedback and so I am definitely listening\n\nPost 11 by Ekermann:\nA grande diferen\u00e7a do TD em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a outros software de treinamento \u00e9 a sua aten\u00e7\u00e3o e dedica\u00e7\u00e3o com todos os usu\u00e1rios.

I\u2019m deciding if I should cancel my TR subscription if this ever gets added. Looking to make a switch here for monthly subscription\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about the addition of the power curve affecting subscription decision\nAnswer: Oh sorry, I forgot to respond. Sure no problem. My developer is doing 1/2 vacation right now so not sure how quickly he can get to it but let me see if it can\u2019t be rather quickly. We have 2 that are kind of close now. If you are doing 300w+ then not ideal but up to about 250 the one on the right is probably accurate enough. Especially considering these conversions from speed to power with these trainers are not that accurate anyway. But still if you want to feel that it is closer to TR then having the same curve would help.\nSolution: Alex mentioned that the developer is working on it and provided a temporary solution with a similar curve.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Thanks @Alex , may I know the powercurve name that is similar? 250 watts is pretty much enough for me since I have a very low ftp and my vo2max would probably hover from there.

        "text": "Forum Discussion: Improved our FTP test + second subject of JetBlack Z1 Power curve\nCategory: Category 28\nTopic Type: Technical Issues\nPosts: 7\n\nPost 1 by Alex:\nSo previously we took the last minute of the test as the average. In some cases this would add part of the drop in power rather than the true 1 best minute of the ride. So if anyone takes an FTP test here they might see a bump in their FTP depending on how they were taking the test. If you just instantly stopped when you were done this should have little affect.\n\nPost 2 by clintbrimson:\nHello, I tried doing the FTP test before but my wahoo speed sensor drops out during my rides and therefore kept stopping the test early. Do you know if I\u2019m able to resolve this? I have wahoo speed + Pixel 4a\n\nPost 3 by Alex:\nOh, I see. Yes our FTP test has never been tested with virtual power. Sorry about that. This should be a pretty easy fix. We will try to have it done in the next week or so and I will update here and you should get a notification.\n\nPost 4 by clintbrimson:\nThanks! Is there anything I can do to stop it dropping in and out? Also, I have a Jetblack Z1 Pro Fluid trainer. Do you know what powercurve I should use?\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nOh good point. I should have asked about the drop outs Can you send me a link to your completed activity or even better a video of what looks like? support@trainerday.com is good\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nI will find the power curve.\n\nPost 7 by Alex:\nClint looking at power curves, the Minora V100 shoudl be very close to yours. See below. We can work on adding JB Z1. image2152\u00d72230 310 KB The top is from JB site, the bottom is ours curves. Our curve is in MPH and theirs is in KPH",

If your threshold is below or equal cp, than there won\u2019t be a W\u2018bal chart. On your screenshot, you see the red dotted line (above the workout) is constant.\nSolution: Ensure that your work is above the threshold to see the W'bal chart.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Got it, thanks so much for your help\nContext: Cesar acknowledges the help received regarding his issue.\nAnswer:",

It works fine for intervals with higher intensity but low intensity, like a recovery ride, will just appear as one big block. Check the Use Laps checkbox and Intervals will use the intervals from the workout. At least, if they are written to the activity file. I\u2019m not 100% sure if they are because I never use the TrainerDay file. I always dual record with my bike computer and use that file. It pairs with a planned workout file in Intervals and takes the Intervals from there. From your screenshot, it looks like the workout targets are in the file. You can see the blue line in the background of the power stream. Try to Re-Analyze from the Actions menu and select \u2018Use Laps iso detecting intervals\u2019. That should give you all intervals.\nSolution: Check the Use Laps checkbox and try to Re-Analyze from the Actions menu.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Worked like a charm, thank you so much!\nAnswer:",

        "text": "But if Trainerday isn\u2019t logging a step marker in the output file, that is wrong behaviour because it should. I suggest you check it out and add steps asap if they are not included.\n\nPost 7 by MedTechCD:\ndalex: Somehow, the TrainerDay .fit files require that \u201cKeep laps for intervals\u201d is also activated. That is how it should be and is clearly explained in my guide post on the Intervals forum. The option is \u2018Use laps for intervals\u2019 an not \u2018Keep laps\u2026\u2019 If this option isn\u2019t ticked, you instruct Intervals to detect intervals with its internal algorithm (detection on power/HR/Pace) and ignore the lap markers in the FIT. If it is ticked, Intervals will not detect by its algorithm and simply follow the lap markers in the file. PS: @Alex The OP\u2019s comment would imply that the TrainerDay output file has lap markers, as it should be.\n\nPost 8 by Alex:\nYes, I thought that was the case for our TCX files (lap markers) but was not so sure on the fit files but I agree sounds like the fit files have them as well. I also did not realize intervals had this lap to interval feature\u2026 learn something new every day\u2026 now let\u2019s see if I remember this Thanks for your help.",

        "text": "that that's the overview of the workout it will auto pause as I said if you have a power meter and you stop pedaling it will auto pause but you can also manual pause and manual start and you can stop a workout early so if you just hit stop button normally it would pop up with a popup do you want to save this workout because this is test mode it's not asking you if you want to do that so then when I when I stop the workout it actually goes back to what we called the warmup or a quick start so this is just a simple workout so we'll go ahead and select that workout again let's just say I or a different workout uh whatever yeah we'll take this workout so I'll go ahead and start again and show you some of the other features here which is for example we have this forward button so over right here you've got a forward button and when you click on it it skips to the end of your interval so if you want to shorten an interval at any point in time you can just you can just skip forward you know when you're when you're you're done with that interval the other thing you can do is you can extend an interval so over here on plus 10 seconds right now we've got 46 seconds remaining if I click on+ 10 now it's 42 I click on plus 10 now it's 51 I just added 10 seconds if you hold this button down for a while you get a popup and you can change that so if I want to ex automatically extend 1 minute now every time I I click on one minute or now every time I click on extend it it will extend it by 1 minute and so I can click on it 4:30 went to 5:30 so then I can go ahead and Skip I can skip again the other thing you can see is every time there's an interval change you can see the screen flash you can also turn up the volume on your phone and you can hear a little beep right before the interval changes either going up or going down right here you also see what is my next interval so my next interval is 2 minutes at 114 Watts so that's this little section right here if I'm adding new devices and if I don't have a smart trainer and maybe I have a Speed and Cadence Sensor for example you can you can go ahead and select your speed sensor and when you select your speed sensor it you get an option for virtual power so you can configure your power curve and so let's just say for one specific device if you're going 30 km per hour um you can translate that into Watts so each device has a a power curve and so let's just say 30 km per hour my on your device might be you know let's just say you know 150 watts or something so so we also support virtual power so now I'll go ahead and show you all the different setting options so you've got hour smoothing that will smooth that little line so the little white line that's going there uh let's go back to my training this this white line you can see the white line and the red line are right over the top of each other this is not normal this is just test mode but the white line is the power line and the red line is the is the heart rate line yours won't look like that your heart rate won't jump like that and follow the follow the power line perfectly but that white line when you some trainers have a very let's say bouncy white line or a very Jagged white line and so this power smoothing Smooths out that line we also have here power match if you have a a trainer and a separate power matter meter and the power meter is showing different values which it always does shows different values than your than your smart trainer let's say you can turn on power match and it will match the power in it will increase or decrease your target or your actual um what's sent to the trainer and so it will try to match the power of your of your trainer to your power meter and this doesn't work real good for short intervals but works good for more sustained efforts you also have a a dark theme and a light theme um we we do support different cycling different sports there's a a device called Swim ERG by Vasa that we support we also support uh rowing from concept 2 um but I won't go into those here you can change the device language we have different languages here and then in other options we have",

Plan B would be to improve the UI as follows to reduce the number of keystrokes necessary! Once you have imported the first ZWO file and assigned it to a list, it would be good if TD retained the list selection for subsequent imports. Once you have saved the imported workout, TD takes you to My Workouts filtered by the list you just assigned . If there was a button on this page to \" Create a workout from [ ZWO, ERG or MRC ]\", then it would save some keystrokes also",

        "text": "So if you want to start doing this, you need to do an initial test to have a baseline. Then after some period of training, do the test again and see if you have any performance differences. For example If I\u2019m doing a threshold block I\u2019ll usually do a 20 minute test around the start of the block, and then at the end I\u2019ll retest to see if I\u2019ve improved my threshold or time to exhaustion. Now the obvious drawback to these tests is that external factors could affect the test results. Things like how fresh you are feeling, the temperature of the environment you do the tests in, mental focus that day, nutrition before the test, and countless others. So do your best to try and replicate the scenario you took your baseline test in. Now after saying all of the above, I think it is also important to not overthink things. If you are feeling better (lower RPE) at a certain power, or if your HR is more stable or lower, or you are doing more distance/speed, trust that you are making improvements. Like Alex said though these things can vary greatly by the day. So just make sure to track trends over days/weeks rather than just looking at one day where you felt great or really bad. Hope this helps!\n\nPost 5 by Robert_UCL:\nThere are many ways to track progression. I always say you can measure anything with everything as long as you do it consistently. Every test has its pros and cons. Personally, I hate testing. It is boring, it takes time (with rest days and all), and it is limited, meaning most tests only measure a small part of your performance. That is why the pros test in the field. They often test the scenarios they will race. I am very happy with the new FTP test in Zwift. A track you can ride where they measure FTP. But normally, I use kom\u2019s to test myself. They are more of a challenge, and that brings out the best in me. I like to use the Three little sisters route. It has three kom\u2019s that test three different power zones over a longer track. That makes the whole test more realistic than one 20-minute effort. I use intervals.ICU, too, but that too has its limitations. However, I think it is complete, and the benefits of using these programs come over time. I have been using it for four years, and for my last race, I analyzed my best season and replicated that program with great results. For my next race, I will use the same program with some extras. After that race, I will look at the data on intervals. I will look for any signs that I have improved (like lower HR and/ or higher speed) and then look at the data intervals.ICU is giving me. That way I can easily translate how intervals.ICU portrays my progress. Creating progressive overload is a fine line between doing a little extra where you can. Most cyclists forget to rest. That is why I agree with Alex that chasing TSS is not the best way. A good example is happening right now. Over the last few weeks, my mother-in-law has been in the hospital. This means my wife and I have to visit her, make appointments with doctors, and bring her clothes and stuff. Besides these extra tasks, her health is uncertain, which also causes mental stress. My schedule is very hectic and full of stress. That means my body can handle less training load. If I keep pumping my usual or planned progressive overload, it could now easily take me over the edge and burn me out or make me sick. The smart thing to do is listen to my body and be flexible in my training schedule. Have fun, Coach Robert\n\nPost 6 by dthrog00:\nSorry to hear about your mother-in-law. I agree with Three LIttle Sisters, that is a great route.",

And a way to filter by tag.\n\nPost 2 by Kafka:\nSeconded. I\u2019m interested in Tags that carry over to Zwift, so that Workouts and Plans that I get from TD get grouped properly on Zwift, instead of ending in a never-ending default grouping as happens now. With the ability for us to edit, add, remove said Tags as we wish. Much appreciated.\n\nPost 3 by Alex:\nOh very interesting. I did not realize Zwift had tagging. How are you getting your workouts from TD to Zwift? I am sure TrainingPeaks does not support tagging so you would have to download ZWO (assuming zwo supports tagging). I really like this if it works as you suggest.\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nOh yes I see ZWO file supports tagging. github.com h4l/zwift-workout-file-reference/blob/master/zwift_workout_file_tag_reference.md # Zwift Workout File Reference This page describes the XML elements (tags) and attributes that can be used in [Zwift workout files][zwift-support-workouts]. It's automatically generated by analysing all of the workouts included with Zwift. It's intended to help people creating workouts by directly by writing XML, or people writing software to generate Zwift workouts. Some of the elements and attributes don't have any effect, even though they appear in the built-in workouts. The [Quantize](#attribute-quantize) attribute is such an example. [zwift-support-workouts]: https://support.zwift.com/en/-sharing-importing-custom-workouts-\\(.zwo-files\\)-\\(cycling\\)-r1IlCybrQ This is a work in progress. If you know about Zwift workouts, you can help by [contributing to this guide](./README.md#contributing). ## Structure Index This file has been truncated. show original\n\nPost 5 by Alex:\nSo we have added tagging (private and public tags) and that tagging is included in ZWO file exports and searchable image2688\u00d71658 350 KB A public tag is a tag that the original workout author adds when creating or editing a public workout. A private tag is a tag that anyone can add for their own personal use for any workout in our library. What we have not done yet is add a tag to Plans (including Coach Jack) ZWO files yet.\n\nPost 6 by Alex:\nCan you explain how you would like to tag a plan? When downloading the plan in ZWO format you can add a tag to all ZWO files indicating the plan name or month(s) or something, or individually tag each workout differently in a plan?\n\nPost 7 by Kafka:\nLooking at workouts on Zwift, it\u2019s able to hierarchically parse tags, so I have workouts that appear as: Workouts (click on) Back to Fitness -> (click on) Week {1,2,\u2026,12} then several workouts are listed for that particular week. Other workouts appear as (click on) Workout of the Week-> one or more workouts are listed. How is that being done? It would be ideal if an arbitrary depth of tags was supported by TrainerDay just like Zwift does. It makes multi-week workouts or plans appear in a very structured grouping, versus individually untagged workouts just appearing mixed with many other untagged workouts. For tags from a TD plan, at a minimum the top tag would be the title of the Plan, the 2nd level tag would be the week and you probably still would want workout names that imply an order to them (D1 or Day 1 abcd, D2 or Day 2 efgh, etc.)",

I don\u2019t know if that is why you chose a coach for example. I think the writing is on the wall for this. One value I see coaches providing is the deep understanding of the individual and their needs and making them feel confident they are understood and then putting them in a \u201ctraining/lifestyle bucket\u201d that they are comfortable with. Software will be able to do this, especially with all the wearable technlogy but still not there yet.

You can see below. https://blog.trainerday.com/a-cyclist-and-his-coach-2dd63b2dc453 But yes I do think you are right that Coaches could use Coach Jack to design their plans but I think most would not for one reason or the other.\n\nPost 3 by RyderDan:\nI decided to hire a coach because I had no experience with endurance sports and needed guidance in cycling training. I enjoy creating my own training programs, and I noticed that the programs provided by this coach were very similar to ones that I found online from Coach Jack. I opted for online coaching due to my shift work schedule, which didn\u2019t allow me to meet with a coach in person. I found it interesting that many coaches sell customized plans, asking all the fundamental questions that Coach Jack asks to tailor a plan. I probably didn\u2019t get as much benefit due to being a pretty motivated person coming from a powerlifting background, and willing to learn and then create my own plans.\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nExcellent feedback. Yeah, I think a coach can be very valuable, especially because humans are not very good about being objective/subjective when thinking about themselves. \u201cYeah, I am fine, just because increased my riding by 3X more hours, my knees really hurt and I am totally sick, I feel good enough for that hard workout.\u201d Or taking data and making poor choices because of data (trying to maximize CTL at all cost). I see the data problem mostly due to all the confusing information out there. But yes, many of us start with a coach and learn quickly and learn how to self coach, with the help of some tools like Coach Jack and can do a good job, especially after a few mistakes\u2026",

As Join is only a platform that creates workouts and can\u2019t be used to actually ride them, I\u2019m trying to figure out how I can easily ride them on Trainerday (paid account). I see several options, as in the Join app I can export workouts to: Trainingpeaks calendar fit. file .zwo file I can of course just download the .fit/.zwo and import it into trainerday as a workout and can then ride it on the app. But I\u2019m looking for a more convenient way. If I can get this workout into my trainingpeaks calendar for today, is there a way to then sync with Trainerday so that it also becomes available in the Calendar there? And would then be able to ride it in the Trainerday app? So without the manual import of the workout?\nContext: User is transitioning from Join to TrainerDay and looking for integration solutions.\nUser Problem: Need a convenient way to sync workouts from Join to TrainerDay without manual imports.\nAnswer: Looks like Join works with TrainingPeaks (I assume that means can sync your workouts there?) So you would need Join Premium TrainingPeaks Premium TrainerDay Premium (Turn on TP WOD feature in our apps and devices) and everything would work like you want it to. I could talk to join about a direct integration to simplify this.\nSolution: Need Join Premium, TrainingPeaks Premium, and TrainerDay Premium to sync workouts.\n\nQ&A 2:\nQuestion: Hi, would a Trainingpeaks premium account be necessary? As I won\u2019t use this at all. It would just be a necessary \u2018step\u2019 to get my workout from Join to TrainerDay\u2026 And yes, I can now sync my daily Join workout to TrainingPeaks Calendar Today. If I would use the non-premium Trainingpeaks, and use premium Join and Premium Trainerday. And I would manually sync my daily workout from Join to Trainingpeaks, and then manually sync Trainerday daily in the app. Would I then be able to do the workout in Trainerday? I assume I need to enable both the \u2018Workout of the Day (WOD)\u2019 and the \u2018Calendar Sync\u2019 settings under the trainingpeaks connection under Apps & Devices? A direct integration between TrainerDay and Join would of course in my case be the best solution! That would be great! I guess more Join users would be helped in this way\u2026\nContext: User is exploring options without needing a TrainingPeaks premium account.\nUser Problem: Uncertainty about the necessity of a TrainingPeaks premium account for syncing.\nAnswer: You would have to test it. I don\u2019t know how Join does this. If join will put your todays workout on your TP calendar then you can see the workout in our app. No you don\u2019t need calendar sync. I should make that more clear. I just sent join an email.\nSolution: Test if Join puts the workout on the TP calendar; no need for calendar sync.\n\nQ&A 3:\nQuestion: Was able to already test it! So I now have a premium account TrainerDay & Join. I synced my workout to Trainingpeaks, and it is in my trainingpeaks calendar for today. When opening TrainerDay and hitting the refresh button, it didn\u2019t sync my existing workout in TrainingPeaks. I tried multiple times. Then I tried deleting my workout in TrainingPeaks, and resending it from Join. This worked! It immediately was visible in Trainerday after a refresh! Great! It seems already existing workouts aren\u2019t synced.\nContext: User tested the integration and found issues with syncing existing workouts.\nUser Problem: Existing workouts not syncing properly between TrainerDay and TrainingPeaks.\nAnswer: Already existing should be synced too. Not sure why this would occur. Glad it worked!!!\nSolution: Existing workouts should sync; unclear why it didn't.",

Looking forward in learning more about TD and how it all works. I have also connected TD to Garmin, Training Peaks, Strava and Intervals.ICU. Is this what I was supposed to do? Regards, Adam.\n\nPost 2 by conti:\nWelcome to the community\n\nPost 3 by Alex:\nHi Adam, welcome, sure you can connect everything. It depends on what your needs are. In a way for some users TrainerDay can be like a toolbox that just simplifies tasks, but then other users use it like their central training platform.",

But it\u2019s not doable as not allowed by Strava. (Only the major players have an agreement with Strava) You can get the pic download from the TD website as your screenshot\n\nPost 3 by conti:\nI\u2019m just wondering if Strava, by creating itself as a big player, is him. According to my thinking, it has become such an FB. Nothing else.\n\nPost 4 by Alex:\nYeah and because they distribute data can be the middle man in cases but yeah, they want to be FB but not doing a very good job of it. Not that I love FB but strava social aspect is not so great.",
