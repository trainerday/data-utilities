# TrainerDay Workout Creation & Management Guide

This comprehensive guide covers TrainerDay's workout creation and management features, compiled from our knowledge base of user discussions, blog articles, and documented features.

## Visual Workout Editor

The visual workout editor provides a graphical interface for creating and modifying workouts. Users have shared their experiences with the editor's design features.

**Row Management**: One user noted: "I enjoy designing my own workouts which generally I keep private as they are designed specifically for me. However I do find the grid where you program the numbers a little frustrating as there doesn't appear to be a way that you can easily insert additional rows."

The editor allows for customization of workouts with various interval types and intensities, though some users have requested improvements to make row insertion and deletion easier.

## The Fastest Workout Editor

According to TrainerDay's blog: "**Designed for one thing. Speed.**"

The workout editor works just like Excel with copy and paste functionality and arrow keys for moving. This familiar interface allows experienced users to create complex workouts quickly.

**Key Features:**
- Excel-like copy and paste functionality
- Arrow key navigation
- Automatic switching between Slope and ERG or HR modes
- Keyboard shortcuts for efficiency

**Workout Duplication**: Users can duplicate workouts on the calendar by holding Option/Alt while dragging. As confirmed by TrainerDay support: "on mac or pc you can hold option/alt when dragging and it will duplicate."

## Sets and Reps Editor

The sets and reps functionality allows users to create structured interval workouts with repeating patterns.

**Known Issues and Solutions**: Some users have experienced issues where reps change when saving workouts. One user reported: "i made a workout, using sets and reps. I input 5 reps, with .1 minutes at a sprint wattage, and 1 minute rest... When I save the workout, it changes the 5 reps to 4 reps."

The TrainerDay team has addressed these technical issues to ensure workout integrity.

## Interval Comments

Interval comments allow coaches and athletes to add detailed instructions and notes to specific workout segments.

**Feature Enhancement Request**: A user suggested: "It would be great to be able to enter comments at the sets&reps line. If my workout is 5x1min catch up drill, then I would want my comment to be: 'catch up drill'. So it would be great to be able to type it once at sets and reps level and then it should be copied 5 times in the intervals tab."

**Swim Erg Specific Issues**: Users have reported that with swim erg workouts, rest interval comments sometimes get overwritten by the comment above. This has been identified as a specific issue that affects swim training.

## Workout Cloning and Duplication

TrainerDay provides multiple ways to clone and modify existing workouts for progressive training.

**User Question**: "Hi I just did a workout that I enjoyed but realised that it was too easy for my goals at the moment. Is there a way to “clone” the workout and then make the adjustments. Just raising it by 110-120% w"

**Methods for Cloning Workouts:**
- Use the 3-dot menu in the upper right corner of a workout
- Hold Option/Alt while dragging on the calendar to duplicate
- Clone workouts to create progressive variations

## Best Practices and Tips

Based on user experiences in our knowledge base:

1. **Speed is Key**: The workout editor is optimized for fast entry using keyboard shortcuts
2. **Use Templates**: Clone existing workouts and modify them rather than starting from scratch  
3. **Add Context**: Use interval comments to provide coaching cues and instructions
4. **Check Your Work**: Some users have reported minor issues with reps changing - always verify before saving
5. **Platform-Specific Features**: Remember that Alt/Option dragging works on desktop for quick duplication

## Conclusion

TrainerDay's workout creation tools balance speed and functionality, providing both visual and keyboard-driven interfaces. While users have identified areas for improvement (like easier row insertion and interval comment management), the platform continues to evolve based on user feedback.

The Excel-like editor remains the fastest way to create structured workouts, especially when combined with the cloning features for building progressive training plans.
