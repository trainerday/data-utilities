# TrainerDay Workout Creation & Management Features

TrainerDay provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating, editing, and managing cycling workouts. Based on actual user experiences and documentation from our knowledge base, here's what the platform offers:


## Visual Workout Editor

Users frequently ask about how to manipulate workouts in the editor. For example, one user asked about inserting and deleting rows in the middle of a workout, highlighting the need for flexible editing capabilities.


## Fastest Workout Editor

TrainerDay's workout editor is designed for one thing: **speed**. It works just like Excel with copy and paste functionality and arrow keys for navigation.

The editor allows you to quickly create workouts using familiar spreadsheet-like controls. You can automatically switch between Slope and ERG or HR modes as needed.


## Sets and Reps Editor


## Interval Comments

Interval comments allow users to add coaching notes and instructions to their workouts. Users have requested features like being able to enter comments at the sets & reps level that would then be copied to all intervals, saving time on repetitive entries.

Some users have experienced issues with interval comments, particularly with swim erg workouts where rest interval comments get overwritten. 
## Workout Cloning


## Summary

TrainerDay's workout creation tools focus on speed and efficiency, with an Excel-like editor that uses familiar keyboard shortcuts. The platform supports complex interval structures through sets and reps, allows for detailed coaching notes through interval comments, and provides workout cloning capabilities for progressive training plans.
