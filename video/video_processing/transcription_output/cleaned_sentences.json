  "Now, let's discuss the details of the training plans and community plans.",
  "I'm going to backtrack slightly and go back to premium plans.",
  "We'll do a green screen here.",
  "This premium plan should probably be included with the previous premium plans descriptions, but it could be broken.",
  "I'm on this page and now I click view the plan.",
  "It shows me a similar view to the community plans details.",
  "It shows you how much work it is, how intense it is, and all the different workouts.",
  "You can even add days to it to make it your own.",
  "You have the same features as my plans here that you can drag workouts onto it, add workouts to the plan, and then send it to your calendar.",
  "When you click send calendar, it pops up and it shows you that you can change the days.",
  "You can do all this stuff, same features that we had on the other community plans.",
  "Now, let's go to my plans.",
  "My plans are either I could create my own plan from scratch, which I'll click on that just to show you.",
  "It's eight weeks long, click done, now it created a blank plan.",
  "It created a unique URL for this plan and I can once again drag and drop workouts onto the calendar.",
  "These workouts are from my workout library list.",
  "Any lists that you create, you generate all these lists and then you can create plans from those lists.",
  "If you drag it over this list, it then has a trash can and you can delete it or remove it from the calendar.",
  "When you have this plan, you can edit the plan details, clone the plan, or delete the plan.",
  "I think you have to put one workout on every day.",
  "I think you have to have at least one workout a week.",
  "Once I put workouts on the plan, I save it, then I can send or download.",
  "You can send to TrainingPeaks, to Garmin, to intervals, to Google Calendar, to my calendar.",
  "You can decide which weeks to send and when it starts.",
  "All of our weeks start on a Monday, so we always start all the plans on a Monday.",
  "With regards to TrainingPeaks, it says this is for premium users of TrainingPeaks.",
  "If you send a whole calendar to TrainingPeaks, for example, it will put them all on today if you are a free user of TrainingPeaks.",
  "If you're a TrainingPeaks premium user, then you can send a whole plan there and it will show up on your calendar normally.",
  "You can also send it to intervals, Google Calendar, or my calendar.",
  "You can download the format MRC, ZWR, or ERG, but it will also create it all as a zip.",
  "It will add a calendar ICS file and a CSV overview of what all the workouts are in your plan.",
  "For your downloaded plan, you can use it how you want.",
  "You've also got the option to share here, copy a shareable link, and you can make it a public plan.",
  "If you are creating a plan, you can share it with other people and you can just click on public plan and then it's available to everybody else.",
  "That's an overview of creating a plan.",
  "Now I'm back to my plans and I'm just showing you we've got this feature activate in mobile app.",
  "Right now our mobile app has one active plan at a time.",
  "You can only have one plan and that plan can be your calendar or your trainer day calendar.",
  "That plan can come from TrainingPeaks.",
  "It can come from intervals ICU WOD.",
  "You can use different calendar sources.",
  "If you say activate in mobile app, you can see here that it will deactivate your calendar or you can use the plan directly.",
  "If you use the plan directly in our training app, it will automatically move from one workout to the next as you complete them and say that you've completed.",
  "This makes it highly flexible that you can follow a plan without having to do it on certain days.",
  "If you've got a four day a week plan and you only get to do two of those workouts, you just do two of those workouts and move to the next.",
  "This one says by coach Jack and it's in bold and it's got the little icon that this actually changes.",
  "On a normal my plans or something I created or copied from somewhere else, view and edit are a single one.",
  "If it's a coach Jack plan, I can view or edit and it's separate view.",
  "View looks like what I showed you from the other my plans page but edit actually takes you to the coach Jack plan builder.",
  "You can delete or send or download.",
  "Now, let's move to the coach Jack plan builder and we'll go to create a new plan.",
  "As a first time user, it shows up like this.",
  "You see this analyze Strava or skip Strava.",
  "You can look at the Strava data, it will collect some of your data from there and help you pick a plan from Strava.",
  "It's not super advanced analytics, it's just basics.",
  "It looks for it tries to find help you find a plan that works for you.",
  "You can say skip Strava and it asks you your name and your FTP.",
  "Then it asks you a bunch of questions.",
  "Once you've answered all the questions, you say take me to my personalized plan and now I get the coach Jack plan builder.",
  "I can set how long it is.",
  "I can either say it's an event and it's a specific date or I can just say hey I want 16 weeks or six months or 12 weeks.",
  "You can decide which makes sense.",
  "In this case, because it's 32 weeks out, it creates three blocks: a base block, a build block, and a peak block.",
  "You can see here it sets intensity level, it sets the type of plan that it suggests you start with.",
  "Each of these details down here depends on which block you're in.",
  "Now I'll click on the build block and you can see that the serious Italian is selected.",
  "It's a different block type.",
  "It started with a base block, a build block, and then a peak block.",
  "It has hours and duration for each block.",
  "We're in the process of changing that so I'm not going to go into a lot of details right now.",
  "I'll create a new video that updates the coach Jack plan builder soon.",
  "You do have a start date here that's important.",
  "It should normally be next week if you're creating a new plan.",
  "If you're editing a plan, maybe it already had a start date.",
  "You can use the same features, you can have a plan on your calendar, you can click on edit your plan from the calendar or from the my plans.",
  "When you click edit, all this data is filled out, it takes you directly to this page and you can make a modification and it will update your calendar automatically.",
  "You can add days off, you can add events.",
  "Rather than having to recreate your plan as things change, you can actually just recreate modify the plan builder to match your new needs or dates or anything else.",
  "It's not full AI training plans, but it's plans that are easy to adjust to your changes.",
  "You've got initial plan questions here which takes you back to the plans.",
  "When you click save or next, you can then send it to your calendar, download it, or whatever.",
  "You may not want it on your calendar now, you may just want it to go to my plans.",
  "That's the general basis of coach Jack plan builder.",
  "I'll create a separate video for that.",
  "Now, let's go back to this home page.",
  "I will go to create workout.",
  "Create workout has a complex editor.",
  "It's got a lot of features but it's fairly simple because it operates kind of like Excel.",
  "When you click on one of these, you can see down here it turns red for whichever row you're on.",
  "You can name it.",
  "You can turn on slope, cadence type, warm up, cool down, HR.",
  "You can set it to 120.",
  "Now this middle one is actually 120 BPM target rather than ERG.",
  "In our workout, we have something called HR plus.",
  "If you have a smart trainer that automatically controls, this will do is it will automatically control the smart trainer to automatically go to your heart rate being 120%.",
  "Obviously, you have to have a heart rate meter and a smart trainer to make that work.",
  "You can design custom workouts that switch in and out from HR to slope.",
  "Slope mode is and then we can say it's a 1% slope",
  "Let's begin with the new video where we discuss the menu that includes App Plan Source Profile Settings.",
  "The App Plan Source is where the app gets its plan, and there are many different places on the site where you can access this.",
  "Profile Settings can be accessed either from this menu or by clicking on your FTP, where you can view all of these profile settings.",
  "These settings include your FTP, your time zone, your heart rates, your threshold heart rate, the sports you're using in our app, your weight, and your drag coefficient.",
  "The drag coefficient and bike weight are used to help approximate speed and distance.",
  "If you're indoors, the bike weight doesn't matter as it is only used to approximate speed and distance.",
  "The conversion from power to speed is generally controlled by your weight, the weight of your bike, and your aerodynamic drag.",
  "We tend to use a 0.5% slope all the time, which is generally fairly accurate.",
  "The average rider's drag coefficient is about 0.6, although super TT guys can be 0.2 and pros might be around 0.28 on a regular bike.",
  "Normal riders are around 0.5, but if you're a skinny, small guy on a road bike with your back at more than 45 degrees, then you're probably down in the 0.35 to 0.45 range.",
  "Each person is different, and indoors, speed and distance don't really mean anything.",
  "However, many of us like to estimate how far we went, and this feature lets you adjust that so that your indoor intensity matches your outdoor speed.",
  "This method is much more accurate than taking the speed from the smart trainer itself.",
  "We also have heart rate zones that can be adjusted when we convert a power workout to a heart rate workout.",
  "Different people have different relationships between their heart rate and their power, so we took the averages here, which I believe are the Coggen averages.",
  "You can change how that conversion happens, and when we send heart rate zones to Garmin or TrainingPeaks, it's actually sending the whole zone.",
  "It's converting the workout from power to HR%, and then it's taking the HR% and converting that to a Coggen zone and sending that zone to TrainingPeaks and Garmin.",
  "In TrainingPeaks and Garmin, the way you have your zone set there is going to control what you see on your bike computer.",
  "We don't support simple HR workouts in our app; you must have a smart trainer and use HR+, which sets the power intensity for you.",
  "The profile settings are more comprehensive here than in the app, and there are a lot more features.",
  "We also have notifications about new features that come from our forum.",
  "If you click on that, it will take you to our forum.",
  "We also have a feature to search workouts.",
  "From many pages, such as the calendar or the search workouts page, you can click on the workout and go to workout details.",
  "Each workout has a unique URL that's shareable with your friends.",
  "Public workouts can be shared with anyone, but private workouts can only be shared with your friends if they are also a paid member.",
  "Each workout has different descriptions, including an indoor description and an outdoor description.",
  "There's also an author's description and interval comments.",
  "I still need to do a deep dive into the create workouts page.",
  "Each workout also includes information on stress, intensity, popularity, and time.",
  "We also have share features and the ride now feature, which you've already seen.",
  "We also have a copy workout feature, which is the same as it is on the other page.",
  "We also have a calculator on this page and on the workout creator page.",
  "You can use this calculator to estimate your critical power and your W prime.",
  "Critical power is like FTP, but it's a little different as it's a bit shorter, usually around a 20-minute timeframe.",
  "FTP probably more closely aligns theoretically at 60 minutes, but in most people's case, it's probably closer to 40 minutes.",
  "Based on a three-minute duration, I can do 240 Watts, and based on doing 20 minutes for 200 Watts, this is my critical power.",
  "When we apply these things and click on this little switch, I now see these little red dotted lines on the workout.",
  "These lines indicate that this workout is probably harder than I can complete, especially since it's repeated so many times.",
  "If I was a stronger writer and had a higher W prime, this workout would still be extremely difficult because it's repeated so many times.",
  "If I happen to be a 25 kilojoule writer, this would equate to a moderately hard workout.",
  "Any activity performed over FTP reduces the amount of anaerobic power you have remaining.",
  "As you rest, your anaerobic power begins to build back up again, increasing your capacity.",
  "If you have longer rest periods, you will have more capacity.",
  "This is a feature of the W prime balance in Trainer Day.",
  "This video is now coming to an end.",
  "You can access Trainer Day, all its pages, the blog, and the forums.",
  "The option to log out is available here.",
  "The process of logging in and out was not demonstrated in this video, but will be covered in a separate video."
