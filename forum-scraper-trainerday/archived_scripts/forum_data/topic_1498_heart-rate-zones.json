      "cooked": "<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>I would like to see my heart rate with color (blue = warm up, green = fat burning, yellow = aerobic, orange = anaerobic, red = extreme) depending on zone I am in. The gauge would also show current percentage of the zone like it is shown on the tiny bar in the power values.</p>\n<p>Why? For example when trying to lose weight, it is recommended to train in the 65-75% of HRmax. And where from should we get the current heart zones? Either by calculating them from well-known formula based on gender, weight, age but tha would mean additional data in user profile. Or better, set the zones (HR from A to B = Zone 1, from C to D = Zone 2 and so on) so every one would calculate/set them individually by own favorite calculation method.</p>",
