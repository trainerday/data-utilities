It seems like i.e. the KickrBike only has one of those two modes\u2026</p>\n<p>So you are right, I think the important point is the automatic switch between the modes (with dialed in level/slope) would be the novelty.</p>\n<p>Use case example:  SIT training, say 5min@FatMax followed by 30sec@AllOut.  There is no good way to do this in ERG.  Probably still best done (for now) like on a \u201cdumb\u201d trainer against a fixed curve, so without ERG altogether.  I think most trainers don\u2019t yet leverage what could be done instead:  Do the recovery in ERG, and the all out bit in SLOPE/RESISTANCE.  Whatever mode chosen, the important part of that would be to choose a curve that requires little shifting. With the right preset this can be done with fewer shifts in the work portion while still allowing to fade towards the later intervals (with maybe a downshift or two)\u2026</p>",

We have no control over shifting in either mode I don\u2019t think.  The initial gear you start in might affect it but I don\u2019t have much knowlege on this.  You can do exactly what you want no in our app, you just have to click the free-ride switch before starting your intervals or keep it in free ride the whole time.</p>\n<p>Let me know how it goes.</p>",

My developer uses a kickr core and does not see this problem.  You can change the setting to 5% in our app too, only press it one time and wait about 5 seconds.  It\u2019s also a good idea to make sure you have the latest firmware.  Really resestance changes should work fine but a little slow in Wahoo.  Yes Slope mode should be a lot better though.  I am hoping we will start this in the next 3-months.</p>",
