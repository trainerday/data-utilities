How much power for how long?  I assume this power is greater than your FTP and in which case you have a very limited amount of anaerobic energy, which depends on your W\u2019.  But generally lets say that is about 6 minutes at 120% of FTP approximately\u2026 Once you do 6-12 weeks of this anaerobic training you will reach your peak W\u2019, and just won\u2019t go any more without increasing your FTP which takes a long time once you are in good cycling shape\u2026  Still even during this 6-12 weeks you might increase it from 3 minutes to 6 minutes and that\u2019s the end of it\u2026  So the numbers matter.  Once you know it should be possible then training something like you suggested sounds fine.  Shorter intervals, longer rests to longer and longer intervals with shorter rests.</p>",

I am assuming you are going low RPM in this climb, so being able to decrease RPM even more, lowers the watts you need to produce to climb it (going slower).  So yes being able to sustain low RPM makes sense, increase duration of low RPM slowly over many weeks.  You can do the calculations, but if you can lower your RPM by 10% (lower your watts by 10%) then you could change your climbing from 120% to 110%\u2026 so the odds of being able to do that quickly are much more likely then trying to increase your FTP quickly.

I actually try to balance these two in gravel riding (long distance mostly) so I can get soreness in either front or back of legs.  It\u2019s possible you could produce more power with your posterior chain then your quads so getting the optimum seat position might give you a little more power or you switch from seated (hamstrings) to standing (quads)\u2026 As I said I don\u2019t know much about this.  Takes more research if their is any value here, I was just surprised how easy it is to dial in muscle usage and how many road bikers all recommend high seats but I am not so convinced that is best for everyone, especially us amateurs.  Not sure how this applies to MTB at all.   Generally I like my seat a bit lower and farther back.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Couple of things considering seat height:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower seat encourages higher cadence. That\u2019s because you become more fluent at the lower point of the pedal stroke, you don\u2019t have to \u2018reach\u2019 by toe pointing or rocking in the saddle. Unless you\u2019re too low which causes difficulties to get over the top of the pedal stroke. But that is very rarely the case. Most people have their seat too high, point their toes and by doing this, fatigue calve muscles. The calve muscle should only be used to stabilize the foot and not to produce more leverage because it is the smallest muscle in the chain from hip to ankle. Setting cleats more to the middle of the foot also reduces calve strain. If you are a natural toe pointer, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that if your toe pointing is very similar over the complete pedal stroke. It is the point/straighten action that fatigues the calve muscle.</li>\n<li>Lowering your seat by 2-3cm, also moves you further forward by quit a bit, result of the seat tube angle. On a MTB with dropper post, you can adjust your dropper/seat lower (and further forward) on the steep climbs while having it higher (and more backward) to adapt to terrain conditions elsewhere. The advantage is clear. While a climb by nature changes your position over the bottom bracket more rearwards, you can compensate and still get enough pressure on the front to avoid lifting the front wheel by pulling on the handlebar. A lower seat also facilitates going out of the saddle and alternate stand-up/seated riding.</li>\n</ul>",

      "cooked": "<p>Somehow I missed this post, so sorry to tune in late.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/blacktek\">@BlackTek</a>: Your question is a typical one. You think you have a short-term goal. As Alex pointed out, you can gain much more over the long term. Your schedule should always be focused on what you can achieve over the following years. In a long-term goal, you can make significant changes and focus on every aspect\u2014gear, nutrition, training, and recovery.</p>\n<p>The gearing you have is actually fine for this purpose. I use a 36-36 for climbing, and that gets me up to 16%. Steeper will make me grind. I did the Scanuppia in Italy. It is 45%, with an average of 22% over the first 4km. It is insane. The next 4 km are steep too, but normal. I did this on an mtb (an old giant cadex mcm from the \u201890 \u2018s <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/see_no_evil.png?v=12\" title=\":see_no_evil:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":see_no_evil:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">), because there is no way you/ I can do this on a race bike with standard gearing. If I ever do this again, I would use a 29\u2019 mtb with a 27,5\u2019 front wheel. Seriously <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/upside_down_face.png?v=12\" title=\":upside_down_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":upside_down_face:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>From the training perspective, you could not do this anaerobically. As Alex points out, your max lies at 8 minutes, and even that is a stretch for amateurs like us. But at 20%, you have no choice. What I do for my clients is that I calculate how much power it will cost them to get up a certain gradient. I find the best climbing profile I can get and split it out for them.</p>\n<p>At 20% you can also zig-zag to make it easier.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/medtechcd\">@MedTechCD</a>: The main function of a dropper post is to get down safely without the saddle hindering you from positioning your body over the back wheel and moving the mtb and/ or your body sideways.</p>\n<p>In general, an mtb seat is positioned just a little bit lower.</p>\n<p>Keep on building that Athlete Lifestyle with consistent training, recovery and nutrition and you can have all the fun you need.</p>\n<p>Coach Robert</p>\n<p>PS: the Scanuppia was so steep (and my bike so old), that I got to a stand regularly. One time I couldn\u2019t get my foot out of the pedal fast enough, lost my balance, and fell sideways. My wrist and ribs hit the fence, my bottle fell out, rolled into the ravine, and I slid down two meters over the \u201croad\u201d (It wasn\u2019t really a road, more a pouring of concrete). I cut my arm, which was bleeding, broke two ribs, and still had to climb 5km\u2019s. <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/rofl.png?v=12\" title=\":rofl:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":rofl:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> But I finished the ride.<br>\nThere where only two kinds of vehicles on that road. 4x4\u2019s and Fiat Panda\u2019s. I got a whole new respect for Fiat. <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/upside_down_face.png?v=12\" title=\":upside_down_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":upside_down_face:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>And now I\u2019ll be in front of the tv, watching Paris-Roubaix. I\u2019d say this will be an epic one.
