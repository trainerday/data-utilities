Really the low targets like this of 50% are meant as low stress recovery parts so you can just ride them at something that feels very easy.  You don\u2019t need to exactly target what it says.  Personally I would not do these workouts on a spin bike <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  I created that plan but it is really for someone using a smart bike that is just starting riding and wants a very low intensity i.e. safe starting point for a plan.</p>\n<p>So I am not sure how long you have been exercising or riding a bike or what your goals are.  Personally if you are just getting started in Zwift I would not do workouts, I would just ride around and have fun <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  If you are new to cycling then try to keep most of your training below about 70% of your max heart rate but at the end of the day if you goal is to get in shape doing what ever is the most fun and keeps you consistent is goal <span class=\"hashtag\">#1</span>.  Once you have been consistent for a while then you can branch out to more structure.  Now if following a structured plan is what you consider fun then please tell me more about your fitness history and goals.</p>",

Yeah, I\u2019m beginning to realise the limitations of no auto resistance.<br>\nTo fill you in I am looking to improve fitness and leg strength from a fairly poor starting point, especially now I am in my early 40\u2019s.  I started using Zwift and the spin bike at the start of September and sessions have been no more than 30mins long.<br>\nI have no prior history of cycling so very much a beginner there.</p>\n<p>I was searching for zone 2 workouts and I though the plan might fit but perhaps it is a bit too easy going for what I need.</p>\n<p>I must admit that I was finding it more fun riding around than the workouts as I could spend more time looking at the visuals than worrying about settings, I was just worried that  I wouldn\u2019t make improvements without having some structure.</p>\n<p>That said, I\u2019ve been reading up and watching videos on the zone 2 HR stuff and that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to focus on, though I\u2019m concerned that 15-30mins isn\u2019t going to be enough to make it useful.  I can\u2019t see me ever doing hours on the bike but I do want to achieve some real improvements in my fitness so I can climb hills.</p>\n<p>I think I\u2019m not really sure how best to get the most out of the bike and how to use the resistance effectively.</p>",

Efficieny in general will give you like and extra 5% but consistency can be 300% or let\u2019s say infinitely more <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">    Only do what is fun.  Get a pattern of high consistency.  Forget about zone 2.  Since you are just starting out, just make sure it feels moderate and you are not breathing hard.  Once you have been going a few months you can start doing once a week of a little more intensity where you are breathing harder.  If easy all the time is not fun then do a bit more.  If you are riding 3 days week you can do anything you want (I would still avoid too much intensity) of you are going 6 or 7 days a week then you need to really focus on keeping almost all days easy.</p>\n<p>Zone 2 is great and very healthy and for that reason you can just try to keep your intensity lower based on heart rate.  Or as I said an easy way is to just make sure can have long conversations without struggling while on the bike and all is good.</p>\n<p>In a year or two get a new bike and trainer and come back to TrainerDay for more structured workouts. <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>It depends on how the spin bike works. What\u2019s the exact model of your bike? I will try to dig up how it works internally.<br>\n99% of all indoor trainers have no power meter. All they do is convert flywheel speed to power with an offset depending on the resistance level. You can very easily check that by accelerating to a higher speed and then stop pedaling. If there is a power meter in the trainer, power will be 0 within a couple seconds. If you see a gradual decline of power while spinning down, it\u2019s as said above, speed converted to power.<br>\nIf the spin bike does the same, your easiest way to follow up on progress, is to take some parts of your ride where you ride at constant speed/rpm. Divide flywheel speed (from the bike, not from Zwift) by average HR for that part and you have a perfect metric to spot progress. More speed for the same HR means that you are getting better.</p>",

I was torn between the Sole and the Schwinn IC4/IC8.  The Schwinn does show resistance on the screen but was put off by having to plug it in and reliability issues.   Perhaps I can upgrade in the future.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this is what I got back from HQ this morning: <em>Please see below response from HQ:</em><br>\n<em>The computer system works that transmitter sends the RPM signal to the console for the calculation.</em><br>\n<em>Then the console displays the relevant readings which request the RPM value to show speed distance, calories\u2026etc.</em><br>\n<em>The resistant system of SB900 is controlled by the magnetic system.</em><br>\n<em>The magnet set is controlled by the adjustable knob to increase or decrease the resistance.</em><br>\n<em>But it is not equipped with the dynamometric device or the additional sensor for the resistant calculation.</em><br>\n<em>The Watt on the console will be only referred to the reading of the speed changes, it can\u2019t perform according to the resistance changes.</em></p>\n<p>Okay, so I could perhaps record laps to get an accurate HR for a given period.  I got the qdomyos-zwift app which I thought would help with accuracy for Zwift but I\u2019m not sure it makes any difference as I would rather use the bike that will be the same across any app.<br>\nIt does give me various metrics though for the ride and can do laps.</p>",
