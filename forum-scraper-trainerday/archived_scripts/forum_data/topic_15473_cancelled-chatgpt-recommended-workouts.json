To start with it will be fairly basic and focused more on WOD but hopefully in the next month, it will at least look at the last 7 days and give you workouts with more variety, and based on your feed back maybe it can lower and increase intensity.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>So Andrea has created word tour winners using progressive adaption but the difference is you start at a very low level and build up slowly so that it never feels super hard until maybe the very end of a training block.   It\u2019s a bit more like strength trainers that don\u2019t go to failure but still get stronger.</p>\n<p>So I would say it\u2019s not that this is required but slight increases intensity cause you the least amount of damage / i.e. recovery,  lowers your risk and keeps you safer/healthier and you are ready sooner to create more adaption.  Obviously you are not going to raise your FTP by 50% in one week.  It\u2019s going to be lots of small 1% increases\u2026 and at the beginning of the season very small amounts of intensity can cause that small X.X% change.</p>\n<p>Chad at TrainerRoad uses the term/idea minimum effective dose.  Even though TR does not follow this from a tool perspective, this terminology resonates with me.  You are only going to increase by a small percent each week and you should do the minimum required to cause that adaption. Andrea, says it does not concept resonate with him <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  but ultimately that is what his training suggestion is (in my terminology).</p>\n<p>Regarding your 7X3 vs 4X30, I would say it depends on the period of your season.  So after a base period a 4X30 could be fine and you build to 7X3 for example.  Even though you could do more then 4X30 even at the start of the year, it might be enough to cause adaption.  But yes if you are in the middle of a training block then dropping a lot likely does not make sense (I never confirmed that with Andrea, but I agree with you).</p>\n<p>Sorry to hear about your agoraphobia.  When I first moved to Poland I actually would say I was feeling something like that.  I never wanted to leave the apartment and the farther I would get from it the more stressed and unhappy I would feel.  But that only lasted a few months for me.</p>",

It\u2019s static at the moment but the way it works it easy to modify your original plan builder plans to give in a sense more dynamic but still not dynamic.  We also just launched the ability to add multiple events to your plan but I would say it is very beta and does not target specific race categories.  Each race does nave a priority A/B/C and has an approximate duration.</p>\n<p>As you read here Coach Andrea Morelli is my primary reference source for designing Coach Jack and even though he is 30 year pro-coach he thinks very different than other coaches including the join team.  I would say Andrea is more simplistic in nature.  We focus on getting you in the right shape for your first A race and then that starts you \u201crace season\u201d where we spend more time focusing on holding on to that peak performance.  A new version of our pre-race taper is coming out next week but still it will likely take a few months before we consider multiple races a great feature.</p>\n<p>I am very curious about join.  They don\u2019t publish much information on how it works and their podcasts are all in Dutch which I only know a few words <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">   We are launching a new product that is dynamic jack with Coach Robert (a human coach) and the beta version of that will be in the next month or so but it will require some heavy Coach Robert in the beginning.  Robert is Dutch so he is trying to find more information about how join works for me.  Mostly just out of curiosity, not trying to copy them as I can see fundamentally we think differently.</p>\n<p>I guess you being a join user understand it <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi, thanks for the elaborate reply!<br>\nOne of the neat features join has, is that it is very dynamic in its 10-day schedule. You are also not able to look further in the future to see what it has planned for you.<br>\nSo basically every week you provide it with you availability, and then it starts calculating. If you on a day don\u2019t have time, you can mark a workout as skipped (for whatever reason), but the plan will then automatically recalculate the coming workouts to make up for the missed workout. Also if you prefer to ride outside, and not follow the workout 100%, it will take up the workout based on strava data in its plan, and will update the coming workouts taking into account the stress from that training. It will also take up any other strava activities and estimate the amount of training stress it took, for instance if you went for a run, it will also recalculate your upcoming trainings based on the intensity of that run.</p>\n<p>In that sense, its easy for a user to not really have to shuffle any workouts manually, as it will always recalculate for you if you missed a workout or did something else.</p>\n<p>I have now played around with the Jack workout editor for a bit. I am actually suprised of the many features already existing! I will definitely give it a try! Only thing I\u2019m a bit stuck on is with off-days, for instance I know I will not be able to do a long workout in a specific week, I see I can add it as an off-day, but after doing that I do not see the other workouts around the off-day changing to more \u2018stressfull\u2019 workouts.</p>\n<p>Anyways, if you have more questions you can always send me a message! <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",
