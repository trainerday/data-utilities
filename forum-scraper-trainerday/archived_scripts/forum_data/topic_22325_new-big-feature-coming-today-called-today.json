We are fixing that.</p>\n<p>This feature is not very advanced now but we just wanted to get V1 out there and will continue to enhance it.  First next steps will be increasing the accuracy of the suggested workouts chosen based on past activities (right now it is primarily looking at intensity factor, desired length and popularity) but as you say looking at this weeks calendar/plan and giving alternatives might be a simple additional win.  We also need to look at recent Strava history not just what you do in our app.</p>\n<p>Yes, I was thinking just like you.  Using PMC based on TSB to decide if someone should have more intense or less intense today.  And if TSB is too deep, it could say \u201cConsider a day off :)\u201d  Probably should get feedback after they do Today\u2019s based workouts and adjust based on feedback as well.</p>\n<p>So we have been trying to do \u201cDynamic Jack\u201d for years now and struggle to implement what we feel is an optimal solution although we have a working prototype now that is a starting point.</p>\n<p>But you are right, as an alternative or as part of this it could be a gradual entry way into Dynamic Jack, or as you say just look at their plan even if it is not Coach Jack based and give alternative choices ultimately leading them towards their target date.</p>\n<p>The key seems to be some how understanding user preference and knowledge, the periodization blocks that lead to that next event and slowly increasing intensity and specificity to the event.</p>\n<p>Some users want it \u201ctheir way\u201d and some users want \u201cjust give me something reasonable.\u201d</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Yes, this is for sure the direction of dynamic jack.  As I mentioned this is two different paths ultimately heading towards the same goal of giving you a good workout for today.  TODAY is the more simple version that will continue to get smarter and smarter.  So we have these two paths that might some how eventually be merged, which is dynamic training.</p>\n<p>Just to give some background.  Coach Jack dynamic will still be a while. We are launching a prototype/beta project soon that is called DCS (Dynamic Coaching System).  It is a dynamic version of jack but also includes a human coach (Coach Robert).</p>\n<p>Because Robert is involved and monitoring the students and providing help it puts less reliance on having all cases covered for Coach Jack dynamic.  Robert is super great and has the same basic philosophies as we do.  So DCS is more like his product when it launches, that we provide the technology for but it is very connected to TrainerDay and Coach Jack as well.</p>\n<p>As DCS improves and stabilizes and we feel it is ready then we can launch dynamic Coach Jack without Robert.  It\u2019s likely obvious but since it includes a human coach it\u2019s in between product pricing and coach pricing.</p>\n<p>Robert has a semi-scalable coaching business now but DCS allows him to take his business to the next level of scalability as in general as the dynamic part gets perfected, he should not need to be involved with daily/weekly workout and calendar adjustments and just focus on communication, guidance and big picture as well as motivating his DCS students.</p>\n<p>So I guess in the depths of this thread I am talking about something coming up <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  I will announce it for beta users in the next couple months.</p>",

It\u2019s fairly basic now but we will keep working on it.  We look at your hardest 2 workouts of the 14 days and suggest something slightly harder (greater IF).  It picks something random within time and IF range constraints.  If you keep pressing refresh it gets harder and harder limit on randomization (not necessarily harder workout because there is some randomization) and after 6 refreshes will reset back .  We put some caps on it to try not to kill people <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>It still needs some improvements as it goes a bit too extreme but it\u2019s more designed right now for someone to find something they like for how they feel today.</p>\n<p>The left 2 workouts in the TODAY feature are usually a bit harder than Coach Jack would recommend. This is more in line with the TrainerRoad approach.  It\u2019s for sure not AI, although personally I think a large set of rules could be just as good or better than AI in most cases (or in reality might be the same thing :)).  This is simple for now.  The idea of IF progressions is not a perfect concept but it\u2019s not too bad until you get to really hard stuff.  Then progressive intervals like Coach Jack are much better from our perspective.  But some people like harder and more \u201cfun\u201d this helps satisfy that need.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t use stress as stress will be connected to duration but if you did the same duration every workout stress should increase over time as well while IF increases.  Now if you do 90 minutes this week and 45 next week your TSS will drop and we will not increase IF.</p>\n<p>With randomization it is not guaranteed that one workout is greater than the last but really one workout with IF=.8 could be super hard and another of .8 might be fine depending on the specifics.</p>\n<p>Anyway I would love feed back and suggestions for improvement <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  for sure we have to get it to better align with what people like.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>I answered this some where else in great depth but there is nothing special to creating a workout.  One workout is good for someone and not the best for someone else, it does not matter who uploaded it (best coach in the world or a beginner with an idea).  If it is popular chances are it\u2019s reasonable for some guys.</p>\n<p>Coaches and platforms have tried to make their workouts seems special but this is not true.  Plans can be more special but a specific workout can not.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all about providing a reasonable workout for the right person at the right time. This will have a benefit.  The wrong workout is more about way too intense or way too easy.   You can see this clearly in TrainerRoad forums talking about workouts.  One person thinks something is fine the other thinks it is way too hard. They were all created by a coach.</p>\n<p>Most important for most users is staying consistent and not digging themselves in too deep of hole.   The perfect workout vs an ok workout probably changes the effectiveness of the workout by less than 5% and affects your overall performance by .001%.   The major big picture of volume and consistency make a big difference (like 90% of your results).</p>\n<p>Doing mostly easy and some hard can produce good results for the majority of people.  All moderately hard workouts is more risky but might work for some, especially in the short term.  Even though I recommend against all moderately hard, in reality if you don\u2019t burn out or get hurt and it it keeps you consistent then all moderately hard can be reasonable.</p>\n<p>If you want a well tailored plan that takes this into account then Coach Jack is better.  Our plan is to better integrate Coach Jack logic into Today but that will still be a while.  I believe our Today is closer to TrainerRoad than to Coach Jack but I am not claiming it is as smart as TrainNow.  Today recommended workouts should be reviewed and given some thought.   \u201cLooks fun and my level, lets try it.\u201d Looks too hard\u2026  We are changing the logic everyday to improve it.  New version is there today and new one coming tomorrow.  Tomorrow\u2019s version should be much better than the one that is there now.</p>\n<p>One problem with TODAY, and my guess is TrainNow in TrainerRoad is that it does not incorporate quality periodization.   Training consistently year in and year out without periodization probably has a negative hit of reaching 10-20% more than with quality periodization (guess, no science to back this up).  Again consistency and volume matter even more than periodization if someone is inconsistent (years of training 48+ weeks a year a few times a week).  So if you are 100% consistent, you could likely do better with a plan.  You could use TODAY and easily incorporate periodization.  Part of the year do mostly easy, and keep picking more and more of the hard workouts as you get towards peak season.  Dr Seiler thinks that all year long of 80/20 with no periodization works ok as well.  It might but we don\u2019t have any proof of that.  We just have a study to show it  is effective for 9 weeks.  Even all year round I think it is reasonable.</p>\n<p>Today tries to always recommend a workout you should be able to do but that is not guaranteed. It can be on the harder side.  Coach Jack\u2019s recommendation everyone should be able to complete because it is a plan and starts easy.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>",
