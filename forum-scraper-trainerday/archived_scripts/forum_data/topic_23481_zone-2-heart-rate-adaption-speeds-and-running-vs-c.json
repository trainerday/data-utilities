Just an extension to app4g statement \u201cper-person dependent situation due to how HR lags vs power\u201d.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I haven\u2019t found any posts regarding HR for cycling from Maffetone himself.</p>\n<p>My two sons drive a small SW company which provides apps for hospitals. One son has a masters degree in Computer Science the other a master in Medicine. Since more than 15 years they are using AI , they have some expertise. E.g. they say that the application from TR could be easily done with algorithmic programming. I\u2019m not sure if XERT uses AI - probably it\u2019s just an adaptive algorithm and it works fine. Based on this I don\u2019t think AI isn\u2019t the way to go, as well for TODAY TD functionality. The current algorithmic implementation is sufficient from my point of view.</p>\n<p>When I am re-thinking, probably a simple approach would be sufficient for TD. Just the two user-parameters for HR up and HR down: currently Prod is 60sec up and 30sec down (Beta 120sec and 60sec down?). The user can figure out what suites him best, regardless what his genetic, his age, his fitness level is, \u2026</p>\n<p>This are only my irrelevant thoughts. We may finish this discussion as I don\u2019t want wasting your valuable time for TD development.</p>\n<p>Regards<br>\nRolf</p>",

Anyway.  I agree 100% with your sons.  Nate has a video describing how they use AI, it\u2019s machine learning. That is not a real time activity and it\u2019s not fast.  My guess is they use AI to get some ideas and everything is programmed with rules/algorithms.  Xert is all rules as far as I know.  I have given it a lot of consideration and testing and I don\u2019t really see a clear place for AI in training other than translating human questions to answers but those answers still driven from rules or data.   I am sure the day will come that AI can play a deeper role but we are not there today.  Just ask chatGPT any question about something you are a true expert and dig in deeper.  It\u2019s just wrong 1/2 the time when it gets to the details.</p>\n<p>So yes your thinking about 30/60 vs other is exactly what I was thinking but I just tested 120/120 with a user and it did not solve his problem so I think something else is going on.  I do think this still might be the solution after I figure out his issue.</p>\n<p>Please always contribute your thoughts.  It really helps.

This would indicate their is potential that cycling AeT is different than running and additional reading that AeT might increase faster for cyclists.  Hence if you have been cycling a while then it could be above this 65% Maffetone limit.  I would still use Mafftetone as the start point, see improvement and experiment.</p>",

I think this 2.0 figure is just a rough estimate for simplicity and it\u2019s really the lactate deflection point.  Talking to the guys at Moxy, that\u2019s how they see it from an SMO2 perspective and this is clear in SMO2.</p>\n<p>You research this stuff more than me so might know better.  But that deflection point could be a different lactate levels also for different sports making it even more complex but regardless what you are saying makes sense and seems reasonable.  I think of AeT being HR related (ventilatory seems related to HR\u2026) but really I guess lactate is the more accurate definition?<br>\nAssuming it is, it seems logical that you could have different AeT for different sports.   I just wonder how much?  I would guess people that run a lot and ride a lot it\u2019s likely closer than people that are much strong at one than the other.  But it\u2019s all just a guess.  Maybe cycling is just higher than running.</p>\n<p>Here he defines AeT as the deflection point in lactate and not strict 2.0 also.</p><aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4f702d167e43d695f0fe6943f1cb46b8ccfb694e.png\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.highnorth.co.uk/articles/aerobic-threshold-cycling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">High North Performance</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/458;\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c7a7dba15eeed1b4c448bbb8f87136e66dd9923a_2_690x458.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"690\" height=\"458\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c7a7dba15eeed1b4c448bbb8f87136e66dd9923a_2_690x458.jpeg, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c7a7dba15eeed1b4c448bbb8f87136e66dd9923a_2_1035x687.jpeg 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c7a7dba15eeed1b4c448bbb8f87136e66dd9923a.jpeg 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c7a7dba15eeed1b4c448bbb8f87136e66dd9923a_2_10x10.png\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.highnorth.co.uk/articles/aerobic-threshold-cycling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The \u201cAerobic Threshold\u201d (AeT) Explained For Cyclists \u2014  High North Performance</a></h3>\n\n<p>In this post, we\u2019ll look to understand what the term aerobic threshold (AeT) means in the context of cycling.

If AeT is lower then 85-87% of AT, it will be more efficient (performance wise) to train your aerobic base. When you get up to 90%, VO2max training will be beneficial for performance. Then again, go back to aerobic.<br>\nNow, let\u2019s be clear, this is a point that will be very hard to accomplish by the average recreational athlete. And you need a met-cart to measure both points with that precision. That\u2019s more for the pro\u2019s, but an interesting approach.</p>",

So trying to say Maffetone is only good for runners and San Milan\u2019s higher numbers make sense for cycling seems like it is not likely correct.  It would seem more likely that the difference is based on the caliber of athlete rather than the sport.  I know you are using Maffetone for cycling but this would be an argument as to why everyone should consider using these lower numbers for cycling.</p>\n<p>I would guess there is some difference between running and cycling AeT but that is more for the advanced athlete that is really trying to optimize Z2 and doing very precise testing.</p>\n<p>Do you agree with my thinking here?</p>",

Then, all over sudden, performance gains kick in and a steady raise is noted for the next 3/4 weeks. Got a light cold then (2) and stopped training for 4/5 days, that\u2019s the short dip. And when I was healthy again, continued the normal training process and I\u2019m very happy to see that the gains keep evolving.<br>\nOver the period of 17 weeks, my Z2 running GAP is about 1 min/km faster and the total distance per week of 60-70km can easily be handled. Even on longer runs around 15km, there is no significantly reduced speed at the end and decoupling for HR/Power is minimal. I do 2-3 MTB and/or indoor cycling sessions on top of the 6-7 running sessions per week. Coping very well with that load. That\u2019s confirmed by HRV and HRrest, which remain almost stable.<br>\nI\u2019m now focussing on increasing cadence some more, still within the MAF HR range. That should be beneficial to even more Z2 speed. I don\u2019t plan to change a lot in my training regime as long as the gains keep coming at the same rate. During all those weeks, only 4 sessions have been done on higher intensity. One run, just because I felt like doing it that day. One MTB ride, plenty of mud, where it is basically impossible to stay in LIT and 2 indoor \u2018tempo\u2019 interval rides.</p>",
