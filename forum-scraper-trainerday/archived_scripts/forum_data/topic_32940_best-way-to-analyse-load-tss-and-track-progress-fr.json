I\u2019m already down with Strava and Garmin at this point, but still at the start of my understanding with TD (which is clearly a really powerful and effective platform, the more you get to understand it). The thought of having to get my head around <em>another</em> platform isn\u2019t something I\u2019m relishing, but I would like to start tracking my fitness progress in a bit more detail, so if I have to start getting up to speed with intervals.icu, then I will.</p>\n<p>Appreciate advice from other TD friends on how they best achieve this aim.

We don\u2019t have anything now.  We will very slowly introduce small and simple enhancements but for true analysis you need something more sophisticated.
