And intensity for all my interval workouts is based on the PD curve and not on FTP.<br>\nBasically I set my interval intensity target based on the last succesfull one and then use a spreadsheet to convert that watt number to a %FTP.<br>\nThe FTP number that I use comes from the Xert IQ field and is still needed to calculate correct TSS. But for workout design, I\u2019m completely independent of FTP. I haven\u2019t performed a true FTP test for months\u2026</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>It is an interesting idea and I understand it and can partially relate.  Meaning I just got back into cycling about 5 years ago and started with indoors and my recovery periods were at 50% of FTP and after I started getting stronger I have evolved to 40%.  I am not experienced enough to understand the nuances of small FTP gains and being able to feel the small increase in rest intervals which is why I said partially relate.</p>\n<p>I was also just thinking the same thing as we added an intensity slider to our workout creator and I was thinking of not increasing or decreasing the rest periods.  That said this is a bit tricky and to some degree might cause problems with public workouts.  If you have the concept of fixed watt rests obviously for 150w FTP guy and a 300w FTP guy they would not need the same fixed watt rest periods.  Trying to make semi-fixed rests could get rather complicated and confusing.  I will keep thinking on this and see if I get any ideas.  It is interesting.</p>\n<p>I also agree with the problems related to such an FTP focus.  FTP is a good startig point as you guys are saying but for two different riders different testing methods can mean two totally different things regarding performance and training.</p>",
