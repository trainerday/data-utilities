      "cooked": "<p>I\u2019m not in full agreement here\u2026<br>\nThe article is from 2015 and the situation regarding cost and knowledge is no longer the same.<br>\nLactate meters are now relatively inexpensive. For a coach using them on multiple athletes, the cost is really low. For advanced amateurs interested in all the physiological stuff, the cost is comparable to a main stream head unit.<br>\nRQ measurement on the other hand is very expensive and can only be done in a lab on a met-cart. And you should specifically tell the tester that you want a test that identifies AeT and not just do a CPET test. A max effort test is almost always done to target VO2max and there is not enough time at the beginning, warm-up, to come to that first steady state that is so important to allow deducing AeT. You start exercising by using predominantly carbs, RQ about 1 and the ramp test kicks in after 10-15 minutes. That\u2019s too soon, because you first need to make your body switch to a fat burning state and that takes on average 15-20min. They should wait until your RQ drops to around 0.7, value at which fat is the main fueling substrate. Only then should the ramp be started. And during VO2max testing, the ramp is way too fast to allow proper identification of AeT. Any decent amateur will have a ramp with 20-25 W per minute. Totally inadequate to test for AeT\u2026<br>\nThe testing protocols for lactate on the other hand are now mainly optimized for AeT testing. You start at very low intensity and stay there for at least 20 minutes, preferably even 30 minutes. Take a first lactate measurement at 5 min and then about every 6 min. Lactate should go down because you switch from carb/glycolisis system to more and more fat. The more fat the lower the lactate because fat burning is not producing lactate and any lactate still in the blood will be used as fuel during that low intensity phase. Then you start a slow ramp or step protocol and keep measuring lactate every 6 min. The lactate curve will do something very similar compared to the RQ curve. Lactate will first lower to \u2018base level\u2019 during the first steady state low intensity. RQ will evolve from around 1 to around 0.7. When the ramp or step is started, both will go up. Now forget about any pinpoint numbers like 2 mmol and the like. What you\u2019re looking for in lactate is the first significant slope change or the point where the lactate is 1 mmol above base level. The rising lactate indicates more carb usage, just like the rising RQ that will return to 1, indicating a more carb dominant fueling.<br>\nIf you want to get anaerobic threshold by lactate and/or RQ, I would advice to not do that in the same test. For AT/VO2max, a steeper ramp test is needed.<br>\nDuring the lactate test, stop when lactate has gone 3-4 mmol above base level. That\u2019s plenty to have a lactate curve that you can follow up during base period. If you do your training in the right way, the curve should move to the right when plotted against Power, and on longer term even when plotted against HR.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>I understand your thinking that lactate testing is easier now, what I believe Maffetone was saying is it is not accurate for aerobic threshold and he feels aerobic threshold aligns with RQ.  As you know just because it is easy does not mean it\u2019s accurate representation of a secondary body state.  And I don\u2019t know if we have advanced that much since 2015 in lab testing of LT1, VT1, and RQ.  I realize home tests have advanced infinitely.</p>\n<p>I also realize you are thinking (and others are saying) lactate aligns with VT1 which means either that Maffetone was just wrong, or his lactate tests were inaccurate.  I just have not been able to find clear evidence of what you are saying is true but maybe it exists (you got anything?)  I see evidence indicating it for lt2/vt2 accuracy.  I have no idea if Maffetone is right or not it just the data dispelling his suggestion looks pretty fuzzy to me at this point.</p>\n<p>I have also seen many graphs like this below.  Which it would be pretty hard to say 2.0 is the actual turn point.

      "cooked": "<p>To be clear, I am 100% in agreement that the most exact way of identifying the fat-burn zone is with RQ. But I mentioned quite some disadvantages like cost and knowledge of protocol to use. Let\u2019s face it, if you go to a lab for sports oriented testing, the N\u00b0 1 priority for the testing facility is sadly still to make money with it\u2026<br>\nI am in hospitals daily as a service technician for diagnostic equipment and the most important thing is that the device \u2018functions\u2019, as in \u2018spitting out a document\u2019 that proofs that the exam was done. Because that is the decisive point that makes the money come in. I\u2019ve seen so many cases where the results on the document are simply the result of recording environmental noise. In most cases, the patient doesn\u2019t need that exam, but it was done simply to make money. Not really harmful for the patient, but a practice that is making health-insurance more and more costly.<br>\nWhat I was saying about the lactate curve is mostly sourced from Alan Couzens and Gordo Byrn. They are mainly following Maffetone, but are using more modern technology. The core message is very much like Maffetone. The user-friendliness of modern lactate meters has significantly improved and the results are much less error-prone.<br>\nI am about to buy my lactate meter and will surely post my experiences with it.<br>\nOn the point if AeT is the same as the lactate inflection point: I don\u2019t know. But AeT is not the same as FatMax either\u2026 What we do know, is that they are all quite close, as in a couple of beats. And your MAF zone is 0-10 beats below the MAF HR. So why are we chasing that exact HR number? Just make sure that you stay approximately 3-5 beats below for the majority of the time and you will be good. But the problem is once again that this is so painfully slow when you start doing it, that everyone trying it out wants to go as high as possible. So they mis-use the formula or use some other test method that gives a higher result. Totally defeating the purpose of the MAF system.</p>",

They (Humon) went out of business so I kind of lost interest but it should still work.</p>\n<p>I am a believer in Maffetone like you, but I think the people that come in listening to San Milan would tend to set it about 10 beats higher, which might work as well but according to Maffetone it won\u2019t in a fair number of people.  So they will try San Milan\u2019s Z2 and say it does not work.  Also Maffetone does not work for 65+ and I have a fair number of 60-65+ guys contact me via email.   Even 60 could start getting more iffy.  Trying to convince people they should go down by 5 or 10 BPM is like a sin, so I am just looking for ideas for alternatives and would love to see a study of 70% of max HR vs 80% of max HR for 4 months in a bunch of \u201caverage cyclists.\u201d   Or Maftone vs maffetone +10.

With my bias toward older athletes it\u2019s always better to be low than a smug too high. When are getting the best results from work outs in this order of value: aerobic, anaerobic, vo2max, threshold, sweet spot, tempo</p>\n<p>I prescribe almost no sweet spot and let tempo happen only out doors</p>\n<p>The rest is 60% aerobic 15 anaerobic, 10% v02max, 10%, threshold 5% over  18 week block. Sometimes if someone  is an aerobic mess I will give them 3 weeks of only aerobic + threshold to break them down but that depends  on their mental strength which has to be high 3setd of 9x9 at threhold is something only the really strong can handle at the brain gate. That\u2019s basically an ftp race hiding as interval training</p>\n<p>For the most part too much threshold and sweet spot leads to frustration for the rider and failed workouts</p>",

But there could be some nuanced differences.  He did train Mark Allen the triathlete.  Mark wrote some books on this too. \nThe biggest difference is runners and triathletes fall apart quickly with too much duration + intensity.  So there becomes no choice.  Cyclists don\u2019t have this problem usually but can still reap the same benefits.  Is it possible AeT is different running and\u2026\n  </blockquote>\n</aside>\n\n<p>So I would guess everyone is a bit different in different sports, I would think monitoring your breadth and ability to talk during the activities might paint a clearer picture if you have a noticeable difference.</p>",
