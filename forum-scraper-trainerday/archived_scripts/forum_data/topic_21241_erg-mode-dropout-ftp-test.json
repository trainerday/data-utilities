      "cooked": "<p>Hi there,</p>\n<p>I\u2019m new to cycling and new to trainer day. I\u2019m using the Tacx Flux S and just tried to the FTP ramp test and noticed that the wattage seemed really inconsistent on ERG mode. For example when the target wattage was 300+ sometimes my actual wattage would drop to as low as 95 and then jump back up to a wattage higher than the target wattage. Sometimes at times I would feel as though it was easy and then in the same interval it suddenly feels harder. Whilst the wattage did drop low my heart rate did continue to climb up to 183 at which point I stopped and got an FTP of 214. Unsure whether this FTP is accurate given the issues noted above.</p>\n<p>Apologies if this is something really obvious, but being new to cycling I\u2019m unsure whether this is normal or not.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nTom</p>",

We have other users that have recently started seeing power dropouts which we believe is something we need to fix in our app and we are working on this now.</p>\n<p>The weird thing is we have a Flux S and no issues.  Can you go to activities on our website and send me a link to your workout and we can help evaluate the accuracy of the ramp test or tell you what it should be if it is wrong.</p>",

If you have an Android device that supports Ant+ (previous generations of Samsung for example) then you could try Ant+.  I would say you should be able to try any workout and see these issues, so you could try something easier than a ramp test.  If I can see workout link (ideally) or screenshot it would for sure help.  It is possible it is a device issue but that I would say is usually less likely.</p>",
