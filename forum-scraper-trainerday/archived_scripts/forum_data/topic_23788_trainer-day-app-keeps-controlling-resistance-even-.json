I use a few other trainer app and none is doing that so I didn\u2019t even look at this as a source of the issues for a quite a bit while. It took me \u201ca few\u201d ffs moments to figure it out. I even had a few longish rides and even one race (it stopped short after I started as perhaps coincidentally iOs put the app to sleep) in Zwift with constant power dropouts. I was blaming the bike for this.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m pretty sure on iOs nobody is ever closing any apps, am I right? You instead just send it to the background. it\u2019s the same on Android to the great extent. It would be my expectation if the app is in the background and no workout is running right now it would release all BT connections including the HRM ones.</p>\n<p>For devices like Kickr Bike and HRM pro that both accept 3 BT connections it\u2019s just really annoying when you know about this, while for the devices that accept just one BT connection that can contribute to the connectivity issues the internet is full of. As you\u2019d be opening all phones, tables etc in the proximity and closing the apps on each just to be able to connect the bike to Zwift/Rouvy etc.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t imagine anyone would call this feature as a desirable one but would be happy if that can be made at least in to a toggle somewhere in settings.</p>\n<p>This is a great app otherwise with great choice of workouts and plans.</p>\n<p>Thank you,<br>\nAlex.</p>",

What it can do is put a timer and possibly just trigger a local notification \u201cyou\u2019re in the bcakground for 5min, do you still want the BT connection to be maintained\u201d. This will still need you to open the app tho.</p>\n<p>The other thing I\u2019m thinking is, if user is currently running a workout, he stops and saves, then he changes to another app, (say FB and stays there for 5min and we disconnect all BT devices), when he comes back to the trainer app, the app has to reconnect to all the devices once again.</p>\n<p>if in Zwift, i think you have to go thru the pairing screen again?</p>\n<p>I wonder how other apps, like zwift behave when user goes into the background and turns on another app.</p>\n<p>Good discussion and thinking about this.</p>",

What I\u2019m 100% sure though is that it\u2019s only the Trainer Day app that still sends the mode and power targets to the trainer after the workout is done and even if the app is in the background.</p>\n<p>I would say if the app would still keep the connection open but would stop (perhaps it can be configurable) sending the mode and power targets after the workout completion it would work for me perfectly!</p>\n<p>I was too wondering why nobody mentioned this before and I\u2019m pretty sure I was just lucky figuring it out because of me loving to do a free ride in Zwift post workout. It greatly helps with recovery and I\u2019m doing it constantly. Wouldn\u2019t I have this routine it would take me \u201cyears\u201d to narrow it down. Plus with TrainerPeeks integration it\u2019s so tempting to send all workouts to Zwift (though that makes Pretzelfesting harder)\u2026</p>\n<p>Alex.</p>",
