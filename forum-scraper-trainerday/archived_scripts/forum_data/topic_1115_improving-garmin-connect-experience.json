We could actually build a chrome plugin that would allow you to do just click on the workout and see the details like in my screenshot below.  The information is in Garmin it is just hidden.

I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve ever tried to calculate how many of your users subscribe to TrainerDay just for the workout library, as opposed to using the app. Maybe you could correlate the users who log on only to view or send workouts, against those who search workouts and use the app, maybe it\u2019s not actually worth the effort. But, I\u2019m definitely in the first camp, I use TrainerDay as ErgDB and don\u2019t really use the app. There must be a reasonably sized group of users like me, and this group benefits from this type of improvement.</p>\n<p>I get that Garmin is a multibillion-dollar company while you are a small, plucky upstart with the world\u2019s best workout database <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\"> So improvements on integration with the likes of Garmin are difficult to impossible, but any of these ideas does help.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, I had suggested placing number of workouts steps in the workout description overview due to problems sending workouts with over 50 steps to Garmin Connect. Have you had any more thoughts around this?</p>\n<p>Currently, I get around these problems (workouts not transferring &amp; lack of description in Connect etc.) by manually recreating your workouts in Garmin Connect, to be honest it\u2019s a pain in the Arse!</p>",

The problem with the 50 step limit is that it is not a fixed rule.  Meaning some times 49 works and depending on how we group the workout into interval steps some times 60 or more might work.  There is no clear logic is to what workouts will work and what will not.  I am very focused on the Coach Jack Garmin experience lately as again that drives revenue and it is something I have control of because they are our workouts and I understand the nature of the workout and where step simplifications can happen.</p>\n<p>Many enhancements that come to benefit our paying users also help our free users.</p>\n<p>All that said there is a number of paying users that don\u2019t use the app and don\u2019t use coach jack and I want them as well as the free users to have the best experience possible.
