This is traditionally the best way to reach peak performance in the spring but the problem is each person is a bit unique and does a bit better with taking control of this process and adapting it it.  Personally I would do this below (do 3 different plans, one for each block)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>HR Zone 2 for 3 months starting right now and do as much as possible, train while fasted as much as possible.  Very gradual warmups.  Try to work your way up to 10 hours a week of zone 2 even if that includes some form of rucking/running or other low intensity endurance work.  Fast walking to work or park farther and walk fast\u2026 But as much cycling as possible is best.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Serious Italian Build period for 3 months</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A peak period that aligns closer to your goals, I like big climbs peak block for about 2 months.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Getting this serious aerobic base will create huge benefits for your build and peak periods.</p>",

If you are feeling really good (not on the edge of over training), you can do a 8 week peak, followed by a 2 week peak just starting at the intensity the previous block ended off at.  As an example Big climbs might start at intensity level <span class=\"hashtag\">#3</span> and go to level <span class=\"hashtag\">#7</span> in 8 weeks and then you can do level <span class=\"hashtag\">#9</span> and <span class=\"hashtag\">#10</span> for example (I am just presenting the idea).  Also I suggest you do a taper before your event to be really ready for it.  Keep the intensity short and generally easy during that week.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/robert_ucl\">@Robert_UCL</a> Do you have any other suggestions for Denny?</p>",

I don\u2019t know what your kg/W ratio is, but that could seriously impact your ride.<br>\nI always advise you to study the climbing profiles.<br>\nAre you a regular climber?<br>\nIf so, you probably know what you\u2019re up against. If not, this is a serious ride. I did the study for you and looked at the climbing profiles. I also read all the comments to see how others experienced these climbs. There is always valuable information there.</p>\n<p>The first climb seems very irregular. You don\u2019t see that on the profile of Etappe du Tour or even on the profile of Climbfinder. But that is the one thing that will kill you on the way up.<br>\nThe other climbs seem regular, as you can expect from climbing in the French Alps.</p>\n<p>You want to know this because you want to know where you will get into trouble. For me personally, everything below 8% is easy. I can do that all day. 10-12% Will raise my efforts to zone 4, which means I can do one hour of that on a tour like that. Everything above 12% will raise my efforts to zone 5, which means there can only be two to three of these parts on a climb, and I need some time in between to recover.</p>\n<p>From that perspective, I would do more zone 4 training during the peak blocks. Combined with some VO2 max intervals.</p>\n<p>You can do this by choosing the big climbs plan. Use it as a peak block. Don\u2019t change anything if you are a light climber and have no problem in the mountains.<br>\nIf you are not a natural climber and the mountains are challenging, Change the second peak block by choosing harder workouts and swap the Dynamic force for VO2 max.</p>\n<p>These workouts are not harder but different, and they will help you overcome the steeper parts without killing you.</p>\n<p>I always use equal gearing in the mountains, which can be 36-36 or 34-34. With that gearing, I can ride anything up to 16%.</p>\n<p>Lots of fun cycling</p>",

I will definitely study the profile now it\u2019s getting closer to the event.  I am not a super lightweight climber at 73.5 kg (185cm) but not heavyweight either, I\u2019m unsure of my watts per kilo ratio as I don\u2019t have a power meter and I\u2019m training using heart rate zones. I have been riding regularly for about 15 years but not with any training metrics. I have done many events and long days on the bike but this be will the biggest challenge I have faced, so probably still learning what I can sustain and for how long.  The question of how to pace it is something I have been wondering. Is there any advice you would recommend?</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>You\u2019re welcome, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/dennylk\">@DennyLK</a>. I see that you are fine, both with your weight and your experience.<br>\nThe best advice I can give you is to buy a power meter. It will make your data and training more consistent. For instance, when training indoors, your HR will likely be higher as your body is trying to cool down in a hot environment without any wind to cool you down.<br>\nPacing is very personal because every rider has strengths and weaknesses. In general, I would recommend starting slow, especially on the first climb, which seems the hardest (on paper).<br>\nIt is better to have something left in the tank at the end than to empty it halfway. You can always speed up towards the end.</p>\n<p>Make sure to keep eating and drinking, develop a plan, and stick to it, even if you don\u2019t feel like eating. Fuel is the one thing that keeps you going.</p>\n<p>Finally you can create a small strip with your fueling strategy and the race profile and tape that on your frame.</p>\n<p>Have fun</p>",
