The app is great, but I feel like I\u2019m missing a setting somewhere and/or I just don\u2019t know how to use the app and/or maybe its a feature related the unpaid version (I haven\u2019t started paying yet, trying out the app to make sure it suits my needs.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, so far I have only used the \u201cquick start\u201d feature just to track my numbers while I follow a peloton video/workout.  The y-axis for watts always seems cut off at around 250 watts.  The attached screenshot from my saved activities does the same.  Any reason why this is happening?  Anything I can do to see the full scale?</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/e2e39e0beafda74d92e565022ff49590fdedd0ab.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/e2e39e0beafda74d92e565022ff49590fdedd0ab\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e2e39e0beafda74d92e565022ff49590fdedd0ab_2_690x494.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"wn9zJf8T5zNnQQS3eJewF5LLtl9\" width=\"690\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e2e39e0beafda74d92e565022ff49590fdedd0ab_2_690x494.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e2e39e0beafda74d92e565022ff49590fdedd0ab_2_1035x741.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/e2e39e0beafda74d92e565022ff49590fdedd0ab.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e2e39e0beafda74d92e565022ff49590fdedd0ab_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1107\u00d7793 101 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",

Rest assured, with an invalid FTP, I can\u2019t even share the workout <em>with myself</em> since all  power settings change with FTP.  I need to copy the entire worksheet, change the FTP value and then paste cells back. Not a good experience - but that\u2019s what I must do if I want to review my results.</p>\n<p>One of the nice things about TrainerDay is your tag line: <strong>\u201cTrain your way, not someone else\u2019s\u201d.</strong>  I am going to say something you probably will not agree with: <em>FTP is far too blunt a metric for building training plans.</em></p>\n<p>FTP is a useful <em>starting point</em> - including for  sharing a workout - but changes must be made to optimize both effort and recovery for individual riders <strong>every day</strong>.  To do this, I need to see all the data.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/891bb1e5c824ba925b2fa8292439992fbd15ca7f.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/891bb1e5c824ba925b2fa8292439992fbd15ca7f\" title=\"compare\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/891bb1e5c824ba925b2fa8292439992fbd15ca7f_2_690x88.png\" alt=\"compare\" data-base62-sha1=\"jyUKtbscVYkEIfCnLyAKM5dD8CP\" width=\"690\" height=\"88\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/891bb1e5c824ba925b2fa8292439992fbd15ca7f_2_690x88.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/891bb1e5c824ba925b2fa8292439992fbd15ca7f_2_1035x132.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/891bb1e5c824ba925b2fa8292439992fbd15ca7f_2_1380x176.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/891bb1e5c824ba925b2fa8292439992fbd15ca7f_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">compare</span><span class=\"informations\">2264\u00d7290 65.8 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>Looking at these graphs, <span class=\"hashtag\">#1</span> tells me nothing.

We do user tests on this all the time.  Graph <span class=\"hashtag\">#2</span> is the only one that users accept.</p>\n<p>We all know that HR integrated against power is a key trailing indicator of performance. This calculation cannot be derived from FTP alone - yet <strong>we seem to have an entire exercise industry build around this premise!</strong></p>\n<p>As I have said many times, these concepts are not new. Prior to Andrew Coggan, FTP and power meters, we had the <a href=\"https://www.brianmac.co.uk/coni.htm\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Conconi Test</a>, HR and lactate lab measurements. Some people think this technique is invalidated by FTP. That\u2019s partially true (thanks to power meters) with one significant exception: HR measurements are needed to fine-tune a workout once you have got the basics right with FTP.</p>\n<p>When I had FTP set correctly in TrainerDay, I liked looking at your zone summaries. Fun to look at but I could not make any decisions based these summaries.  Here is the most important chart that I look at before each workout as I decide how to change parameters:</p>\n<p><strong>HR versus Power</strong></p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/f1eb0b31b7ebe82f4e3042e47d4b16f57df53903.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/f1eb0b31b7ebe82f4e3042e47d4b16f57df53903\" title=\"power versus recovery\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/f1eb0b31b7ebe82f4e3042e47d4b16f57df53903_2_663x500.png\" alt=\"power versus recovery\" data-base62-sha1=\"yw6EfGtdPEcvmSpWcAfw72K0Nof\" width=\"663\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/f1eb0b31b7ebe82f4e3042e47d4b16f57df53903_2_663x500.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/f1eb0b31b7ebe82f4e3042e47d4b16f57df53903_2_994x750.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/f1eb0b31b7ebe82f4e3042e47d4b16f57df53903_2_1326x1000.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/f1eb0b31b7ebe82f4e3042e47d4b16f57df53903_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">power versus recovery</span><span class=\"informations\">1845\u00d71390 244 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>Measure length of T1 (time from minimum to max HR) and T2 (recovery time) to set P1 (max interval slope power) and P2 (erg recovery power).
