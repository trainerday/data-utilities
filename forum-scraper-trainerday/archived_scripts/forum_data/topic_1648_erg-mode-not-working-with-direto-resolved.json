I toggled between ERG and the other mode just to be sure but there wasn\u2019t a change.  I\u2019ve used this trainer with other Apps and it works fine in ERG mode.</p>",

I did the FTP test and advanced the intervals to the harder ones and the trainer made that familiar noise and I sensed some resistance.

      "cooked": "<p>Interesting, good to hear it is working.  Increasing our smoothing helps but our smoothing needs a better algorythm to make it really smooth.  Wahoo has it\u2019s own smoothing which is really good but my Tacx Neo is super jumpy too.  I would love to make our smoothing like Wahoo\u2019s or at least be able to smooth it.  Yes I like Netflix too, and really I like different things but our app makes it perfect that when you want simple you can use it and don\u2019t mind paying for a month of Zwift sometimes if that is what you are in the mood for.
