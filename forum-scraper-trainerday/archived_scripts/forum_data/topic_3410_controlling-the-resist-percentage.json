It sounds like you might know something I don\u2019t but is there any difference between slope mode and resistance mode?  From what I have read they are basically the same, just a different numeric value.  Slope might not be linear resistance increase but ultimately a given slope can be directly translated to a specific resistance on a specific trainer.</p>\n<p>Below article it says \"Level mode applies a standard resistance curve to the trainer. \"  They call it levels mode which is just slope mode.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402565219218-A-Guide-to-using-Level-Mode\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402565219218-A-Guide-to-using-Level-Mode</a></p>\n<p>Please let me know,. if there really is a difference we could consider adding automated resistance control, it should not be too hard.  The big difference is 50% on a trainer with max resistance that represents 2200watts, is different than a 600w trainer so these workouts would not be very shareable where slope is more shareable although trainers have different limits.</p>",

What we\u2019d usually do for starting starts (unless actually doing them) is get a super old school oil resistance trainer, and gear the hell out of the bike and see what gear we could \u2018overcome\u2019 at a decent cadence.</p>\n<p>Same for 5-6 second sprints, I think its more intuitive to know what resistance is \u2018holding me back\u2019 so to speak, of course you get the output wattage as well! Personally having to trial and error what slope percentage = what resistance isn\u2019t immediate (although this is a very me problem!)</p>\n<p>Having the resistance change mode would make it the ideal velodrome app, reporting directly to coaches what cadence and watts i\u2019m holding at a given % resistance is equivalent to finding my current power gear (big deal!).</p>\n<p>Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but both Trainer road and Zwift just don\u2019t offer anything close to this?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>totally agree with the difference in trainers, I think just being upfront that this is a percentage rather than an absolute value would be reasonable!

Now Rouvy allows you to upload a route that has a slope to it so theoretically anyone that allows importing a route kind of supports this but that is much more convoluted process than using our slopes instead of resistance <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>So we have a few users here that have built spreadsheets that convert slope x cadence to watts.  If ultimately you are trying to target watts for a specific cadence then I think it\u2019s ultimately the same either way meaning.  You need to have a formula unless you always use the same RPM, then you could memorize it.  If you are going to have a forumla to determine your slope targets then I would think it is basically the same whether it is resistance or slope.</p>\n<p>So resistance % is specific to your trainer, so saying I am holding a specific resistance percent is the same as saying I am holding a specific slope degrees although slope degrees translates better from device to deivce.  I would think if you prefer to say resistance it\u2019s probably simple math like slope times 3 or something.</p>\n<p>I would be happy to be the best app for velodrome cyclists <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">   We try to support what we consider underserved needs as long as they are not too small of niche  <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>If I am wrong about my thinking regarding needing to use excel anyway and with resistance you could do it with excel because you are not focused on watts as much as newton meters (resistance) and rpm and this really made the difference by supporting automatated resistance mode as I said I would consider it because it should not be too hard.</p>",

For example  \"I can generate 1,000 watts for 3 minutes\u2026 \" (I can\u2019t but\u2026 <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> ) \u2026 then it is an apples to apples comparison especially when watts / kg are not so important.</p>\n<p>But you still don\u2019t really want to use ERG mode because you want to do it by feel (gears/cadence) so you need to know how to set the resistance (slope) up to a value that sets you up to be in the right gear at the right time, the good part is 5% grade should be similar on all trainers (never tested this).  I believe a Tacx Neo takes into account your weight but I don\u2019t think most other trainers do.  So this makes slope superior to resistance even though it is a bit less intutive as workout sharing should be possible across devices.</p>",
