      "cooked": "<p>I just tried my first GPX to workout converted ride.  Once I got used to gearing and changes, everything was going great.  Then I hit an odd issue.  The first time the app hit a negative slope value, the bike (SB20) went crazy.  I didn\u2019t realize it was negative since the app displays rounded percent slope so it just showed 0% (I will be submitting a feature request to display decimal slope values). Resistance spiked and I couldn\u2019t even pedal.  I skipped the interval and continued.  Everything was good until the next negative. - again displayed as 0%.  I skipped and went on.  The third time it happened I let it go and shifted to the easiest gearing to see how long it would last. Well it peaked over 600w and I had to skip after 30 seconds. Then it kept happening every few intervals - and not only on the negative slope ones.  It even happened on a +4% slope.  Finally at the end it was so erratic I had to end the workout.  Here\u2019s what the recording looks like:</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/8b07fbd4a2f003f2113c3541907d96438f17a23e.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/8b07fbd4a2f003f2113c3541907d96438f17a23e\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/8b07fbd4a2f003f2113c3541907d96438f17a23e_2_690x240.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"jPVtlP55oM1ZcCn9eKAApqWZ2Hk\" width=\"690\" height=\"240\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/8b07fbd4a2f003f2113c3541907d96438f17a23e_2_690x240.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/8b07fbd4a2f003f2113c3541907d96438f17a23e_2_1035x360.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/8b07fbd4a2f003f2113c3541907d96438f17a23e_2_1380x480.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/8b07fbd4a2f003f2113c3541907d96438f17a23e_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1445\u00d7503 105 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>Does TD not send negative slope correctly?

I\u2019m sure a workaround would be to just switch to ERG mode for negative slope intervals and enter in an appropriate wattage.  But for converting a GPX file to TD would take a bit of additional work to swap all negative slopes to low ERG watts.  Not impossible, just inconvenient.</p>\n<p>Looking at the results, it looks like it\u2019s not necessarily all negative slope intervals that were causing issues.  There were some blocks of multiple negative intervals (3 minutes or so) and the bike was handling those just fine.  Is it possible it was just the first interval in a negative block that was handled incorrectly?  I think I\u2019ll put together a test workout using a mix of negative and positive slope blocks and see if I can get a consistent result.</p>",
