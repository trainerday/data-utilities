I can only see the title of the workout and not the interval blocks. This only happens when I\u2019m using it in Samsung DEX mode. I have attached a photo to show what I mean. It means I can\u2019t see how the workouts are structured when I scroll through the list.</p>\n<p>I hope this can be fixed.!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/uploads/short-url/zRR1GMjr6VZ6UhPw31vGJNVdrpO.jpeg\">20240227_151310|666x500</a></p>",

The app opens up fine, but the workout list view doesn\u2019t show the structure of each workout in the list, it\u2019s as though the bottom part is hidden because on some of the workouts I can see the very tops of tall intervals.</p>\n<p>I had Another major issue today when actually starting a workout. It started the warm up power perfectly at a low 140 watts and kept a straight line, but when it was supposed to ramp up to the next 15 minute interval it just stayed the same. I kept it going for a few minutes to see if it would change, but it didn\u2019t. It stayed on 140 watts the entire time. It was supposed to be 199 watts. Because of this I had to reinstate my Trainerroad subscription and use that instead.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m afraid to say that I\u2019m going to have to cancel my TrainerDay subscription again as it\u2019s unusable. Which is a real shame as there are many aspect of it that I prefer over Trainerroad.</p>",

They have a lot of money and large testing team with lots of devices so they can currently afford to be more stable for all device combinations, although many users have issues there as well.  But still % wise less than us.
