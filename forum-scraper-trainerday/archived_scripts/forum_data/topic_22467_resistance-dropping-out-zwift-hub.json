It only seems to happen at slightly higher powers, maybe over 100W. Sometimes it will jump up to the correct resistance but then drop again.</p>\n<p>My trainer is working fine with the Zwift app so it seems to be something with Trainer Day. I tried multiple different workouts I have done before in TD with the same result. Tried both with and without power smoothing. Nothing in my setup has changed. I am using TD on my Samsung phone bluetooth\u2019d to the trainer. The app is up to date.</p>",

I just closed TD app, stopped my watch and restarted the trainer. Started TD (the training was remembered and I could just start where I left off), connected watch and all was well.<br>\nIt looks like the Zwift hub stopped broadcasting just speed and cadence since the update so now I have to connect to it as trainer on my watch (before it found the trainer as a speed/cadence sensor). I guess this gives some conflict\u2026</p>",
