He said for him he doesn\u2019t see any clear proof that tents do much although they seem to be used consistently in pro cycling.  Now he believes if you are going to race at altitude spending a month their first is important and if you can live at altitude and race at lower elevations this has a noticeable benefit.  He said it seems like no large groups of cyclists are living at sea level and training in high elevations or even the opposite, they really are using tents.  I see on another forum that someone said they sleep terrible in a tent and so even if they had any benefits it was not worth it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s interesting.  I like to try to understand this stuff.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>What\u2019s funny is he even wrote an article on it recently in Italian and here is a translation.</p>\n<p>HYPOBARIC TENT = ALTITUDE TRAINING? NOT EXACTLY</p>\n<p>From this year, Italian athletes can also use hypoxic or hypobaric tents, which until last season were considered equivalent to doping practices.</p>\n<p>A historic ban included in the anti-doping penal law 376/2000 has been lifted. In a communication sent by the Ministry of Health to the Medical Sports Federation and all sports federations at the end of November, it read: \u201cIn reference to the latest ministerial decree containing the list of active principles and doping methods dated October 23, 2023, which states \u2018The use of the hypobaric chamber is not prohibited; the athlete who resorts to this practice must remain under the strict control of a sports doctor both before and after using the hypobaric chamber,\u2019 it is stated that this indication arises from a scientific-bibliographic review carried out by the Superior Health Council, which expressed itself at the request of the Section for Doping Vigilance and Control of the Technical Health Committee to provide a technical scientific opinion on the possibility of using the hypobaric chamber for sports use. This method was prohibited, contrary to what was already provided by WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency). In order to align the treatment of Italian athletes with those from other countries, the Section for Doping Control has decided to proceed with the aforementioned request.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now that Italian athletes can prepare like their international competitors using this tool, it is important to understand its purpose and how to use it. \u201cEven though the investment is not insignificant, there has been a boom in requests regarding the purchase of hypobaric or hypoxic tents, which allow athletes to simulate altitude in the comfort of their own homes. There are numerous models available (even portable), which, connected to a compressor, progressively reduce the amount of oxygen available, as if the athlete were sleeping at high altitude: in this way, the body is naturally forced to produce more red blood cells, and therefore, there will be a greater percentage of oxygen available to the muscles for sports effort,\u201d explains Andrea Morelli, head of the Movement Analysis Laboratory at the Mapei Sport Research Center in Olgiate Olona (Varese).</p>\n<p>\u201cSimulating altitude or being at altitude, however, is not the same thing. At altitude, the percentage of oxygen in the air is the same as at sea level; what changes is the partial pressure of oxygen, which affects the lungs\u2019 ability to exchange oxygen and bind it with hemoglobin to then be transported in the bloodstream. In a hypoxic tent, instead, there is a dilution, a decrease in the percentage of oxygen to try to reproduce what happens at altitude,\u201d continues the coach, a reference point for cycling at the Varese center, which many professionals, both individually and as scientific and technical consultants of some teams, rely on, such as Lidl-Trek with Elisa Longo Borghini, Jonathan Milan, Elisa Balsamo, and Giulio Ciccone.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe first studies conducted in the mid-to-late 1990s by Swedish and Finnish researchers in the early 1990s seemed very promising, showing high gains in terms of serum erythropoietin, red blood cells, and hemoglobin. However, these results were downsized by further research carried out by Australian colleagues in the early 2000s, which demonstrated the efficacy of this technique with only small gains and only with a stay of at least 8-18 hours a day for a period of at least 3-4 weeks simulating an altitude of about 3,000 meters.\u201d</p>\n<p>Andrea, [5/31/24 10:48 AM]<br>\nFor Morelli, the investment is not worth it; a training camp in a beautiful mountain location with teammates is better, especially because during a retreat, the volume of training (hours) and the total ascent work make the difference. In any case, if opting to use a hypobaric hypoxic tent, one must take the right precautions. \u201cFor a professional athlete, I personally prefer altitude training. For amateurs, I recommend focusing on other aspects, primarily training. Often, the distribution of weekly work and the periodization followed are incorrect; addressing bike fitting, following a personalized diet both in and out of races, before considering these \u2018marginal gains.\u2019 Following the scientific guidelines of the \u2018living high and training low\u2019 protocol, we can try to maintain the training intensity at home as if we were at sea level, but we need to adjust the training volume because sleeping \u2018at altitude\u2019 with less oxygen available prolongs recovery times,\u201d concludes the expert.</p>\n<hr>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi Kabanez2,</p>\n<p>The thing about altitude training that most people don\u2019t realize is that the training doesn\u2019t really take place at altitude. It is actually the recovery.</p>\n<p>Most pro teams hire a hotel high up at altitude, but there is no space on top of the mountain to properly train a cyclist. So, they go down and train for five hours, then come back up again and sleep at altitude. While their body needs to recover, they spend time in thin air.</p>\n<p>A lot of companys try to sell us stuff to mimic these results, without a solid scientific foundation. It has already been researched that training under low oxygen circumstances does not deliver the same results as being at high altitude. Again, you only have to be at high altitude to get a bigger blood volume.</p>\n<p>The reason is that a lack of oxygen simply shortens the effort you can do and therefor makes a training less effective.</p>\n<p>Wearing a device like hepoxtech when you are not training makes more sense, but you would have to wear it for most of the day and during sleep.</p>\n<p>That brings us back to the same downsides as the tent: sleeping with a device like that is probably not comfortable. It will likely get you less sleep quality and therefore less recovery.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m a simple guy, and while I don\u2019t mind to suffer really hard, I also think that cycling should be fun. So, I would choose a trip to the mountains any day above sleeping in a tent or with a device on my face.</p>\n<p>Besides that, this is not a sustainable approach. You can do this for a couple of weeks after which the effects remain for a couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>Have fun, Coach Robert</p>",
