Same bike and power-meter BTW)</li>\n<li>if I train indoors for the next 4-5 months with that FTP, when I\u2019ll ride again outdoors next Spring, can I hope to restart the season with an FTP at around 290-295W ?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I worry because if I train with targets 20W lower for 4-5 months, even though I feel the workouts to be as hard as they were outdoors at a higher power, I wonder if I\u2019ll be able to ride outdoors with a FTP of 290-295W or if I\u2019ll be restarting the season at 270W\u2026</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Oh I understand.  If you do your spring training correctly lowering your winter/indoor FTP will not negatively affect your summer/outdoor FTP and I think this is a good approach.</p>\n<p>Ususally what most people see and what is RECOMMENED is when they get to their seasonal peak (2021 peak), then over the winter that drops a little (exact amount depends on many details) and then as you build up your spring volume to previous levels you get back to the same level (2022 peak) and higher if you do things right.</p>\n<p>Some people that train harder in the winter and might see a winter increase in FTP.  I would even call this \u201cFTP training\u201d meaning you are training to improve your FTP which does not necessarily meaning training to improve your outdoor group or race performance. Thse same people usually don\u2019t see the same large spring increase.  They say I increased my FTP by 20w in the winter, but then they don\u2019t improve in the spring or very little also they loose motivation and feel burned out after a hard long winter and a hard spring.</p>\n<p>Try to make sure your early winter training does not push you too hard so that you don\u2019t have the motivation to do a hard spring build up period.  Holding your FTP is not that critical as it will come back fairly quickly when you do start training harder and get back to previous levels of training.</p>\n<p>All this assumes you want a late spring peak period.</p>\n<p>Not sure if that helps.  Sorry for the slighly off-topic suggestions/thoughts.</p>",

I\u2019d prefer to have at least 15 min more each day on the shorter wo, and to reduce by as much on the longer ones (though, still keeping them really \u201clonger\u201d, so they have their own purpose).</p>\n<p>And I confirm what your friend says, I also read somewhere that a 60 min ride indoors could be equivalent to a 100 min outside, according to some \u201cexperts\u201d: I can feel it, for sure.</p>",

Also as you point out for some riders it is better to reduce long rides and distribute to other rides. Especially for 100% indoors riders. I will work on improving this but I know that does not help you now. For now best is putting limiter on weekends and increasing start hours a little to increase the week days. We will improve this but it might take a few weeks. Either that or just end long rides early.</p>",

Dropping it down doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me, especially since it will affect your shorter rides as well as the longer ones. Riding indoors can be more difficult due to a number of factors - ventilation, lack of movement on the bike, etc.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve done a number of 4 - 5 hour rides indoors over the years. I would suggest making sure you have plenty of fluids, nutrition, and one or two fans blowing on you. The other thing that helps me is making sure that I move around on the saddle (like one does when riding outside) as well as getting out of the saddle and standing every so often to give your seat and muscles a bit of a break. Getting off of the bike, pausing the workout, and stretching a bit also helps.</p>",
