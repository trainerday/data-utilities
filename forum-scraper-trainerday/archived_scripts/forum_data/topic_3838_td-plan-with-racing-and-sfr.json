      "cooked": "<p>Hello all,</p>\n<p>I\u2019m new to TD and just created my first plan with Coach Jack.<br>\nAfter following the recommendations I ended up with a Crunched Power Plan.</p>\n<p>Some background:<br>\nI\u2019m a 42y old dad with normal office hours (work from home).<br>\nBeen cycling regularly for almost 2 years now, mostly indoor, but when I can I do the occasional 3h long ride on the weekend (when family and kids allow). Usually I ride between 4 and 5 times a week, with the regular sessions taking between 60 and 90mins.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been mostly doing TR and Zwift (racing).</p>\n<p>With the new Plan I ended up with 4 sessions per week, what is the recommended path if I want to do the weekly (sometimes 2) Zwift race? Should I replace a workout or add the extra volume?<br>\nIn TrainerRoad I usually have a low volume plan and just add the races on the off days with this adding extra volume.</p>\n<p>Side question, ended up here after some posting regarding SFR workouts. I\u2019m curious about trying it, but not really sure where to start. Is there a post detailing SFR for beginners (never really did that much low cadence work). Basically if I would like to try it, is there a workout and respective instructions you can point me to ?</p>\n<p>Thank you and keep up the great work!!!</p>",
