And also in recovery week, basically it\u2019s zone 2 ride with low duration. When we talk about recovery ride, it\u2019s IF&lt;0.5 or less (i guess)? I know we can manually input to the plan, but i am just wondering will the Team input a recovery ride to CJ plan, especially to acommodate those who have &gt;14 hour per week to train.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>So I see three issues we are talking about</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Missing recovery days?  Sounds like you figured this out.  Must be 5 or 6 days to have recovery days or in some cases 3 days in a row.  After your comment though, I just improved the Tue, Wed, Thur, Sat, Sun pattern to include Wed Recovery (see below)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Recovery rides have too much intensity (I just fixed this, not sure how that got missed, thank you.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Recovery weeks have too much intensity or not enough recovery rides.  I will have my coaches review.  \u201cCoach Jack\u2019s\u201d belief is you only need two things for a recovery week.<br>\na)  Reduced stress (tss) for the week (we have this)<br>\nb)  Remove the hard rides for about 4 days (we have this)</p>\n<p>So you don\u2019t need a bunch of recovery rides, you just need to do enough of a reduction so you feel fairly rested and bring your TSB (training stress balance) down to reasonable level.  We reduce both hours and stress.  See below.  But I think you might be right that we might need a slighly larger reduction in TSS on the recovery weeks.  Each individual is different in what they can handle based on how much they sleep, their age and other factors and at the minimum I will improve this to make recovery weeks easier for people that don\u2019t get at least 7 hours of sleep a night <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/0b7be96cbaedb2abfcce0a322ed27584ddc7e3b8.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/0b7be96cbaedb2abfcce0a322ed27584ddc7e3b8\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0b7be96cbaedb2abfcce0a322ed27584ddc7e3b8_2_690x183.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"1DAJnREwUK2TG3bPG1CRgcnGHNe\" width=\"690\" height=\"183\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0b7be96cbaedb2abfcce0a322ed27584ddc7e3b8_2_690x183.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0b7be96cbaedb2abfcce0a322ed27584ddc7e3b8_2_1035x274.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/0b7be96cbaedb2abfcce0a322ed27584ddc7e3b8.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0b7be96cbaedb2abfcce0a322ed27584ddc7e3b8_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1302\u00d7346 41.6 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",

That\u2019s the one that triggered my interest in TD so much that I had to give it a (paying) try. I don\u2019t know if I will continue with TD, for now it seems to be a good solution for training indoors; hopefully some day it will be possible to record rides outdoors, with map/elevation\u2026 I will probably decide next Spring which one I will continue to support. And I have no complaints on one or the other, each have their strengths.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>At some point, you still have to do some kind of test to really know where you are on your capabilities, to train at the right amount of intensity and duration.<br>\nXert is quite good for that\u2026 Some of their fitness tests are <em>hard</em> for sure, but with short intervals you can get an estimation.<br>\nMy problem is that the tests that I did (mostly the \u201cunder pressure\u201d and \u201cversion 2\u201d) always give me a TP too high. It\u2019s flattering on the moment, but when you need to follow workouts based on that TP, it\u2019s impossible to finish them (at least for me). For ex. last Winter those tests estimated my TP around 290-295W\u2026 but then, I wasn\u2019t able to do Seilers 4x8 min at 275W (indoors), when the target was around 306-310W.<br>\nMy guess is that those tests based on short intervals are faulty if you have been training on short intervals (which is what I was doing back then), because they can\u2019t really estimate your capabilities on longer intervals.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>There is a pretty simple solution now if you want to train the Polarized way:<br>\nDetermine your VT1 and eventually VT2 (not really needed). You probably already know your VT2 (anaerobic treshold) and you can get a really good estimate of VT1 (aerobic treshold) with dfa-alpha1.<br>\n4 sessions out of 5 are below VT1, easy enough. The one hard session is around or above VT2. The easiest way of determining the start intensity for a specific interval duration is to take 93-95% of your best value from the last 30-60 days. You can get that from the Power/Duration curve.<br>\nThen do your hard interval session with that value to start and dial up the intensity when you\u2019re able to do more or less 1 interval extra.<br>\nExample: from the P/D curve you have a best effort of 200W at 8 min. Set up a workout with 5 intervals of 8 min at 186-190W. If you can\u2019t finish the first 4, reduce intensity a bit. If you get to 3/4 of the fifth interval, raise intensity a couple watts and start over.<br>\nThat\u2019s it. No need to test.<br>\nYou only need a FTP in the ballpark to get your training load more or less accurate.</p>",
