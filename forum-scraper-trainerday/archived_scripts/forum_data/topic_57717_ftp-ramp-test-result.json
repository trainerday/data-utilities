Not a chance. 20min maybe, MAYBE, but I am not going to try lol<br>\nSo my question is, do I keep this value and proceed with training to see what happens OR do I lower this number?<br>\nThoughts?<br>\nDont get me wrong, I was working hard to get faster and stronger, but did not even expect that much increase.

      "cooked": "<p>Congrads!!! A ramp test is a a good indicator of progress and obviously less painful than a 20 minute test, so you improved, which is the most important thing.</p>\n<p>Muscular i.e. people with big anaerobic contributions tend to see bigger discrepancies between a ramp test and actual sustainable wattage.   As painful as it is, doing a 20 minute test to compare to 1 time is good if you want total accuracy.  In my case, I can have up to about 20% difference (more muscular with poorer aerobic).  So if I tested at 230, I would know I am more like 190.  For training, I would use the 190w value.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t feel total accuracy is usually that important for FTP based training.  You can cross reference what you feel like you could sustain in a race for 40 minutes.  If that is say 270w\u2026 use that for training.</p>\n<p>Anyway unless you are trying to push yourself to failure most workouts high precision in FTP for training is not that critical. Different people have different failure points even with the same FTP.  Dylan Johnsons latest video brings up the concept of durability being more important than FTP.  And suggests doing a 1-2 hour \u201chard\u201d zone 2 ride followed by a 20 minute test\u2026  We ultimately want to improve our durability.  FTP is irrelevant if you can\u2019t sustain high wattage for your desired race or ride time.  So again, I am just pointing out you can set your FTP based on RPE of how you think workouts should feel.</p>",

Using and FTP to set zone 4, 5 and 6 (zone 7 is just max power) and a different test for zone 2 (zone 3 is in between).</p>\n<p>As soon as you start training you will understand what this number means anyway. I find that I an sustain my FTP during short interval sessions. The longer my ride is the less I look at FTP.</p>\n<p>I watched the Dylan Johnson video, too. He explains it really well. That\u2019s why the interval sessions in the beginning of the training schedules I ride are at the beginning of the training and later move towards the end of the training.<br>\nFirst you want to build power, than you want to build fatigue resistance or durability.</p>\n<p>Just start training and see if this is the number you can put on the pedals during your short intervals. That is what you tested, so that is what you should use it for.</p>\n<p>Have fun</p>",

My FTP from a ramp test would also be about 200w right now but my durability sucks so my actual FTP would be much lower.   So he said he has not done a ramp test in a year\u2026 unlikely he will want to do 20 minute even though I suggest he could for complete accuracy\u2026 but I agree you can just do a few sustained efforts and realize pretty quickly the likely hood of completing say 40 minutes in a race.   He could try 250w, 275w and 300w for 5 minutes each with a longer break in between and see which one feels like 20-40 minutes and estimate FTP from that.</p>",

There is potentially some missing nuances to this but I agree with the core idea.  He also helped facilitate that sweet spot was the best way to train (via maximizing your weekly TSS) and Dr Seiler discusses flaws in Coggan\u2019s thinking in this regard.  So like everyone Coggan can get things wrong too but still worth listening too and in this case it makes total sense to me.</p>\n<p>Even when I said above their are potentially 2 zones\u2026 I would argue he is saying there is 0 hard line physiological zones, unless these zones could over lap\u2026  So again I think it is all more nuanced.  I think the value of zones is partially to make sure you are getting some variability in your training and zones helps keeps this concept simple.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s interesting he says lactate has more variability than HR\u2026 He also points out how small of power differences relate to a 10% difference in steady state time\u2026 This is very interesting.  I would like to look into this more.  Meaning at 300w FTP 303w would decrease duration from say 40 to 33 minutes?  Hard to believe it is that tight but I never tested this.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the way CJ workouts are design having the perfect FTP setting is less of an issue.  If you were doing sustained, sweet spot or sustained threshold that is where having closer to your CP40 to PC60 power makes a big difference.</p>\n<p>I would say Andrea, Coggan and Seiler all give zones a lose definition.  It\u2019s more like variability and time vs power\u2026</p>",

I would even argue 220-age, provided some value. It shows that age contributes to HR decline, but we know now it\u2019s highly dependent on our health.</p>",
