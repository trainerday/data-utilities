      "cooked": "<p>Hi, don\u2019t worry there are all kinds of people here, many just looking for health and/or weight loss.  I am not exactly sure what you are asking for but there is a lot of controversy regarding exercise and weight loss.  Many people will tell you weight loss all happens in the kitchen.  I myself work to maintain various levels of health/fitness and weight and now at 58 it takes a lot more than it did in my 30s and 40s.</p>\n<p>Science and \u201cexperts\u201d will give conflicting advice.  I believe my advice is not overly controversial.  Which is the only thing that matters is consistency.  So this means do what is fun and sustainable.  The more fun or at least \u201cleast un-fun\u201d the easier.  The beginning is usually the hardest part but then staying on the path then becomes the hard part.  I suggested people do the bare minimum but more often, that could be 7 days a week with a minimum 5-minutes and if it feels ok then do a bit more.  If having a plan like a Coach Jack plan inspires you then that is great.  Many people do well sticking to a plan and others not so well.  I would set a goal for a date for 6 months from now and just follow the plan jack gives you.  It will be 3 blocks, base, build and peak.</p>\n<p>Either that or just start with a 12-16 week base plan and then we can go from there.  Find something to pass then time.  Watching netflix and easy pedalling is great.  Listening to  music, making phone calls to friends\u2026 You don\u2019t need to be breathing hard at this time to make gains and each phase just safely prepares you for the next phase.  Going too hard in the beginning for fast results is not the solution.  We all want fast results but focus on the process not the results.  Consistency is all that matters.</p>\n<p>I have a lot more advice than this but not even sure that was what you were looking for. You are right we should also add a weight loss plan to Coach Jack.  If that is all you are saying you are 100% right.</p>",

For me it would be beneficial if someone (in this case Coach Jack) could take the guesswork away from me and just create some sort of a plan that would probably follow what you wrote in your reply and suggest me the most common sense approach to stay active on a trainer and focus on losing weight. For me that would mean that I would not have to think about VO2Max, differences between HIIT, endurance rides, power intervals and if it would make sense to start with base, base+ or base++ and all the other things I don\u2019t understand. You know, like a no-brainer approach. You answer a couple of questions and proof, the plan gets created for you.<br>\nI do thank you for the detailed suggestions above - I have created a plan and can\u2019t wait to try it out.<br>\nSorry for my English, it\u2019s not my primary language.</p>\n<p>Best regards, Ali</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Your English is fine, I agree with Dave, Base+ is great, all these other workouts just give variety.  After your initial base period you can ask again and I can give you ideas to experiment a little.</p>\n<p>I also agree with Dave their is likely more support for adding muscle for weight loss than cardio work.  But cardio can boost your motivation and be a good place to start.  Once your motivation goes up adding some weight training can help.  I personally see I lose weight with higher volume cycling, like cycling outdoors 8-10+ hours a week of easy riding outdoors.  Indoors it\u2019s hard for me to be motivated enough to do that kind of volume so use indoor more as a short duration period just trying to hold on to some fitness.   So in general, I think exercise and feeling in shape is the critical component to weight loss as it helps drive motivation for a full life embrace of health.  Without the exercise I seem to struggle to hold on\u2026</p>\n<p>I think strength training can be very minimal, especially in the beginning.  10 minutes a week can actually do a lot for the first 2-3 months until you get into a good pattern and even after that you can have a plan to keep it very short.</p>\n<p>So we are looking forward to hearing about your progress.  For me I have set myself a goal of a 150km gravel \u201crace\u201d in May.  Having a goal like this helps with motivation.</p>",

If you train too hard you need to fuel your rides which doesn\u2019t help with weight loss. A calorie deficit is key so keep those rides easy and volume is better than intensity.

I believe that the required intensity in  Z2 could be the ideal solution for those who want to do physical activity and stay healthy without, however, undergoing high intensity training which, in my opinion, at my age of 66, would be better left alone . According to some coaches, Z2 training trains the body to use fat to produce energy. I don\u2019t know, and I would like to ask Alex if coach Jack is able to prescribe training sessions only and exclusively in Z2 or what parameters to use so that coach Jack is able to build a workout in z2. I wrote some very simple workouts for personal use only of about two hours trying to manage 60/65% of the max heart rate. It\u2019s clear that they are quite boring but they get the idea quite right.</p>",

I think as we age we should push ourselves at times as well but that can be very small amounts or zone 2 + weight training for example.   We have the HR+ feature.  Just click on quick start, then HR+ in our app and set your target HR (buttons at the bottom) and it will slowly build to this and then keep your HR in your desired location.  This is the ultimate for pure HR based Zone 2.   Coach Jack is polarized in nature but pure zone 2 is better with this HR+ feature.</p>",

I also spent almost as much on saddles as i did my last car probably got 50 of them in the basement.</p>\n<p>So I am currently down to 260ish almost 100 pounds in 12 months at 38. I have also not yet dieted. yes i make smarter choices on food home cooked or pizza hut or read whats in the food im ordering.</p>\n<p>What worked for me was a Coach jack plan that I didnt follow very well. it would want me to ride 30 minutes Z2 well my bottom would only let me do 13 so I would go for a 17 minute walk for the rest of it. At 260 pounds I can ride an hour with moderate discomfort. I would also stop and delete the coach jack plans after the base period because yeah no way was I going to do 30 minutes of tempo without a heart attack.</p>\n<p>So if you find you cant fishish something due to discomfort caused by your weight. I would get the rest of the exercise minutes doing something else. I would agree it would be nice if I could tell Coach Jack i want 12 weeks of Z2 not 4 weeks of base, 4 weeks of build, and 4 weeks of peak so I wouldnt have to either keep redoing the same base workout or constantly creating new plans.</p>",
