      "cooked": "<p>So we have created a new plan creator (available to all premium members NOW). We have termed it \u201cCoach Jack,\u201d to be clear it is not a human coach.</p>\n<p>Below, I am showing the creator below, but actually Coach Jack can review your Strava history and ask some assessment questions and suggest a plan for you. Once the intial plan is created, you can tweak it as much as you want using the screen shown. This is not using our community created workouts or plans.  This is 100% custom workouts and plans, each workout and plan desiged exactly for you.</p>\n<p>This creator is the first of its kind. I would call it the \u201cStarbuck\u2019s\u201d of plan builders, meaning the goal is to allow you to have it \u201cyour way\u201d yet still guiding you in the primary fundamentals of effective and safe training.</p>\n<p>One of the key features is this first ramp rate slider. If you don\u2019t know, Ramp Rate relates to your week after week hourly (training stress) increases.  Seasonal increases is a critical component of peak performance. I would say virtually all or at the minimum most top performance riders seasonally increase their hours and training stress. For most dedicated long term performance riders that means a big increase from winter to spring.</p>\n<p>Again the goal of the Coach Jack plan creator is to allow you to dial a plan to fit perfectly within your constraints which is a key component of top performance.  This is just the first version but it will continue to be improved and expanded, we are exited to start getting feedback and improve it to meet the needs of a wider group of performance cyclists.  It has been designed with a few top coaches reviewing it and providing suggestions.</p>\n<p>Next on the list of features is setting an event date as well as annual training plans. Also we want to give more visibility to training stress aspects of the plan but for now as soon as you push to TrainerDay you will see that.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/d3d839c2dfa53f54d2dd0ef1699a367ba020a962.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/d3d839c2dfa53f54d2dd0ef1699a367ba020a962\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d3d839c2dfa53f54d2dd0ef1699a367ba020a962_2_487x499.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"ue40sYZYxzsZvNBupTatVAMp3fY\" width=\"487\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d3d839c2dfa53f54d2dd0ef1699a367ba020a962_2_487x499.jpeg, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d3d839c2dfa53f54d2dd0ef1699a367ba020a962_2_730x748.jpeg 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d3d839c2dfa53f54d2dd0ef1699a367ba020a962_2_974x998.jpeg 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d3d839c2dfa53f54d2dd0ef1699a367ba020a962_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1158\u00d71187 200 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>I love this feedback, thanks for the review.  My pro-coach friend and I both have a lot of respect for Joe, so I also believe it\u2019s not against the \u201crules\u201d to have a minimum of one hard day a week all year long.  Now I did coach a 75-year old and convinced him to do 3-months of pure base  and following that he had his best (senior) season ever and won is age group state championship in the US and qualified for US senior olympics.</p>\n<p>My belief is if you are serious about peak spring performance you need to make sure early winter sets you up for being hungry for a solid build/peak period  so you are going into mid-late January rested.  I would think most won\u2019t feel this rested after 2-hard days a week.  One shorter HIIT session you likely would.  Depeneds on the individual I think.<br>\nI do agree with your thinking/approach though, just giving my 2-cents.</p>\n<p>If you feel really strong but not very tired a the end of your build period and did a fairly big build then you likely did it right.</p>\n<p>So as we launched this tool, I now realized it could be useful for someone like you or me. Originally I thought it was more for the cyclist that did not know how to create a plan. Now I realize it could generate the plan I like but much faster than any traditional method.  Or use this to generate the plan but then slighly tweak it in TrainerDay when it is done.</p>\n<p>I have been sick followed by busy launching this and want a new \u201cbase\u201d plan which I planned to create manually but I want to do 15-minutes a day 7 days a week with 4-Z2 rides 2-recovery rides and 1 Tabata HIIT ride.  I can still do this much faster using this Coach Jack tool taking 6 days a week of base and adding the HIIT in TrainerDay.  So yes your idea of \u201chard-day\u201d option is a good one.</p>\n<p>I would love to hear about what changes we could make to make it so you use Jack to create the core part of your plan.  I do realize for the self-coached cyclist this may not be that important but I would still love to hear it to get ideas. Polarized will have 1 hard day but again your idea of a selectable hard day is a super great idea.  We could offer like 10 or more different types of hard days.  Meaning different types of workouts and different types of progressions of those hard days.  Super good idea.  I think we will do this.</p>\n<p>Yes, DCRainmaker avoids the smaller brands but as we improve Jack\u2019s plans this is so different I might be able to convince him.  I have more hope for getting GPlama (Shane) to do this soon as he said he already wants/plans to review TrainerDay.</p>\n<p>Thanks again. You got me even more excited <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Regarding one or two hard workouts a week.  Based on my talking with my pro-coach friend and I repeat myself one of the top science based coaches in the world (including being one of of the few with $10 millon plus labs\u2026).  His belief is that it is primarily about managing volume and seasonal progressions.  Again in his opion you don\u2019t  need to do 2X20 regularly most of the year but seasonally you could build up to 2X20\u2019s.</p>\n<p>This slow and gradual seasonal building up causes adaption more than just jumping in the deep end.   Now that said if you want to treat a 2X20 as an period race that can be beneficial. Basically everyone he coaches has some very hard efforts fairly regularly (mostly races).  So these really hard efforts are not necessarily part of the plan but just something that happen.  This is where more dynamic planning is important to factor in these \u201craces\u201d into the plan.</p>\n<p>We might be saying the same thing.  I am just saying our plans are designed around the structured part of the plan and the great efforts are something you optionally add in at the level you are comfortable with and ideally you find to be fun.

Most cyclists belive it is the hard efforts that are making you fast but I would argue based on discussing with Andrea that actually the hard efforts are required because most people are doing it wrong when it comes to performance.</p>\n<p>If you correctly manage your volume, recovery and progressive overload then the painfully long hard efforts become optional.  Also their is this great tendency these days to over do the hard efforts (TR style) that it is giving reasonable performance but at a high cost.  I belive that what Dr. Seiler proved with his studies is not that 80/20 is the best but that 80/20 is better than too much hard effort.  So my conclusion from that is that the theory of maximizing your TSS/CTL is secondary to do the right training and the right recovery.  So do it right first, focus on CTL secondly (and optionally).</p>\n<p>So I am not trying to say that hard efforts won\u2019t work I am just saying their is an alternative approach that is safer and in many cases will produce better results.</p>\n<p>If you look at Coach Jack\u2019s Serious Italian plan, this plan does it \u201cright enough.\u201d It could have some enhancements but it is good.<br>\nIt provides the right fundamentals to doing it right. For one is a solid variety of complimentary core workouts (SFR, Threshold PROGRESSION, and a long ride)  other days are Z2 or recovery.</p>\n<p>Not sure if you have done SFR or 35-45 rpm Zone 2 intervals before but they will build your leg strength like crazy but don\u2019t cause so much stress other than muscle stress.  They are hard enough that if you started at the end of the progression without doing the beginning it would be dangerous.</p>\n<p>Also the threshold build slowly to eventually doing this workout.<br>\n2 X (3m@70% + 4m@80% + 4m@100% + 5m@40%)</p>\n<p>Obviously this is nothing compared to a 2 X 20\u2019 but it provides the stimuous you need to seasonally move forward to your peak.  Assuming you started rested after ideally a couple months of base.</p>\n<p>Now if you are commuting 5 days on a single speed which is probalby Zone 4-5 at least from stop lights <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> \u2026 you might not be getting the recovery you need to optimize your gains or you need a more advance program to make sure you are <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> You need to turn some of those commutes into pure Z1 at the minimum.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Two things.  We are currently including sweet spot progressions in our plans which are not the same as sweet spot intervals popularized by TR.  We are creating progressions that build to sweet spot intensities as our \u201cmain work\u201d but secondary work is still lower than sweet spot and generally the main work gets longer and longer progressions but overall much easier than TR\u2019s type of sustained sweet spot.  But you also found a bug that this sweet spot progressions is missing in this plan.</p>\n<p>Our belief is their is a re-education process currently going on including Dr Seiler\u2019s Polarized and Dylan Johnson\u2019s youtube videos and a general long history of training fundamentals that TSS as the primary goal is not the best practice.</p>\n<p>All that being said, we are open to others beliefs and don\u2019t belive the TSS focus is 100% wrong for all people (just most) and feel that in order to represent what many people likely want due to the plan ecosystem that Coggan/TR and others have created we will need to add some more \u201ctraditional\u201d sweet spot interval workout progression plans.   Those will be coming soon.</p>\n<p>We base our plans on long standing fundamentals and science proven training. HIIT has been been science proven effictive for time crunched individuals.  Lower TSS (polarized for example) has also been proven more effective.  High TSS plans have not been scientifically proven so we have not included them.  I know lots of people say it works for them but that is not science or does it show that it is more effective then more tradtional plans.
