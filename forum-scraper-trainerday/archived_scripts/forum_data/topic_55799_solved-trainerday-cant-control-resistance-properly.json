I didn\u2019t change any settings. I\u2019ve even had it happen in the middle of a ride where it will start off working fine, then I pause to use the restroom and I come back and it does this odd behavior.</p>\n<p>I thought it was my smart trainer so I went out and bought a new smart trainer (by a different manufacturer). It does the same thing with the new trainer. Has anybody else had this problem? I\u2019ve tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it. It still does it.</p>",

Some apps start out with very low power target and build it up slowly. We should enhance our app to do this but since I never hear of people with this issue I have not prioritized it.  We should not have changed any thing that affected this but you never know.</p>\n<p>If you used to have it in a smaller gear on your bike and now have it on a bigger gear, it could make this much worse.</p>",
