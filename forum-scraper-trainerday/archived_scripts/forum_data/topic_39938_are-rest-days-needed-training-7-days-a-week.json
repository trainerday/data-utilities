There is a whole group of Running Streak association that has done like 20 years of everyday.  Now are they winning marathons, maybe not but is it healthy or give them reasonable performance.  I would guess so.  One of the guys on the dev team here has been running almost 3 years every day, never missing a day.</p>",

For me consistency is the most important factor and if I shoot for 7 days a week, even if I miss a day or 2 I am still doing well.  Also I think this goes back to the idea of very traditional base.  Hal Higgdon suggested when new runners start they should do 2-years of base before working on going fast.  Low intensity is safer, especially when you are fragile like I currently am, it will be easy to destroy myself with intensity.

There is no one-way solution.</p>\n<p>I see that a lot of amateurs frustrate themselves by following schedules and doing training they don\u2019t like just to get better. In the end, you can get better in a lot of ways.</p>\n<p>Since we all have other priorities like work and family, we always leave gains on the table like a mid-day nap. Therefore, I coach people to train in a way they can keep up for the rest of their lives and stimulate them to look for improvement beyond their schedule, like better nutrition, short core training, etc.</p>\n<p>In the end, you want to perform while staying healthy and having a lot of fun in the process.</p>",
