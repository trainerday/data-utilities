It seems that the increased training stress is implemented by a combo of both more intensity and time as things stand.</p>\n<p>If a person has only so much time to train a week then then how can I continue to improve without the training time going up and up - or can\u2019t I? Do I need to adjust ramp rate/intensity upward whilst keeping the hrs at the start of a block the same?</p>\n<p>Many thanks.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>It\u2019s not perfectly optimized for a stress only plan but what I would recommend is using a small ramp rate like 2 or 3 but just set it so your max hours is the hours you desire. This is less total training time but should produce better or at least as good of results as the flat hours plan.  This allows us better control over all to prescribe the right intensities and gives a better plan than setting at ramp rate = 1 but that said if you do ramp rate = 1 and increase the starting intensity you will see that your plan will build in TSS over the plan but still ramp rate 2 or 3 is better.  You can also set limits on each day but again that will not produce the best plan.</p>\n<p>See example here of ramp rate = 1 and starting intensity being higher<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/60e6e4185a757d40d8284bc2f9841b1599a54638.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/60e6e4185a757d40d8284bc2f9841b1599a54638\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/60e6e4185a757d40d8284bc2f9841b1599a54638_2_690x310.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"dPewaqxZBaYp453R3JkUnb00NgQ\" width=\"690\" height=\"310\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/60e6e4185a757d40d8284bc2f9841b1599a54638_2_690x310.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/60e6e4185a757d40d8284bc2f9841b1599a54638.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/60e6e4185a757d40d8284bc2f9841b1599a54638.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/60e6e4185a757d40d8284bc2f9841b1599a54638_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">932\u00d7420 49.9 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>We do need to spend more time focused on your use case.

I belive and the coaches I get advice from that volume (refering to weekly TSS) needs variability on multiple levels for maximum gains and without it most cyclists will get stuck in a plateau.

But after a progressing cycle of 6-8 weeks with a \u201csafe\u201d training plan, your FTP should normally be higher. Thus, if you repeat that same cycle with the new and higher FTP, CTL will be very similar but the total amount of \u201cwork done\u201d will be higher because the overall power output is higher. And you will improve again and again.<br>\nI\u2019m not saying that you should do that same thing year round, but a lot of newcomers can. And it will take quite a bit of time before they plateau. People tend to think that they need to increase intensity but intensity is relative to FTP. If you plot a chart with \u201cwork done\u201d, the improvement becomes visible in that chart while it is not showing in the PMC chart.<br>\nBut let\u2019s be clear, base-build-peak is a solid and proven technique that provides a variability in triggers to the body and lifts the results to a higher level.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Daniel, so over-training in it\u2019s classic definition is a possible risk but in cycling for most riders does not seem to be such a problem.  Maybe over-reaching and burnout can be.  But the biggest problem is that because most people have a limited amount of time in order to maximize CTL they push towards more intensity.  A focus on more intensity for 4/5 days a week has been proven a less effective training method.</p>\n<p>That said, if we look at the chart provided by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/aguti00\">@aguti00</a> this is a text book perfect PMC chart.  It\u2019s valuable to see that the PMC chart looks reasonable and perfect is usually a safe bet for most people to ensure you are getting a good balance of stress and recovery.</p>\n<p>So I would say rather than a CTL focus, having a TSB or ATL as a focus for one of the legs of your plan is good and by optimizing your TSB for example you will end up with a decent CTL ramp rate.  So PMC metrics are valuable but more from a verification and risk aversion stand point and not from a trying to maximize your CTL stand point.</p>\n<p>CTL has 3 components, consistency, duration and intensity.  Intensity is the least valuable and most risky (to reduce your training effectiveness) portion of this metric.  The problem is most people feel that intensity is the part of these three they have the most control of.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Oh yes, this now makes more sense and as usual I mostly agree, but something my pro coach friend clarified a while back is that he has proven with his athletes that quality volume variability by itself creates adaption.  So small weekly/monthly variations cause mini-build cycles.  So don\u2019t build to 8-hours and stick there for long periods.</p>\n<p>Secondly regarding a clarification on increasing intensity is you can build intensity but still keep most of your training at a less than ~80% level. CJ takes this approach.</p>\n<p>Since this cycle is usually about 20-30 weeks you realistically only get about 2 of these periods a year and this may not work well for many outdoor cyclists that just want to enjoy their performance level from spring to fall.</p>\n<p>So below is visually this is what I am suggesting above.
