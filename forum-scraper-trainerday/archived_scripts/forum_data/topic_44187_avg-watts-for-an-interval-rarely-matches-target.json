I am always in erg mode.</p>\n<p>On a TrainerRoad workout each interval will hit the target or miss it by one watt. The same applies to any other app I have used. I can check that in intervals.icu or WKO5.</p>\n<p>Today I did 2 times 20 minute Sweetspot at 90%. I did it well, didn\u2019t have any issues, much as normal.</p>\n<p>Results (target/actual) 216/207, 120/115, 216/212.<br>\nI assume the warmup intervals were the same, I wasn\u2019t really watching.</p>\n<p>What I do find with TD that is different from other apps is that it seems to take time to get back to target power if I miss a pedal stroke or ease off a little to get a drink etc.</p>\n<p>Has anybody else noticed this.? Maybe other apps increase effort to ensure compliance by the end of the interval, although that seems unlikely as the workout is just a plain text file really.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>That\u2019s interesting, I would say if you are this aware of this then the other apps must do an adjustment and how they internally work is very different than the text file that is loaded into them.  Because we just set the target.  We say target = 207w.  If you are not producing 207w at certain times then it will never match in our app.  You can imagine that if other apps are not adjusting and you stop and start again there is no way it could exactly match the target if they did like us and always send target of 207w.  It\u2019s an interesting observation.   If you look at outdoors it\u2019s never going to match or be consistent power. My opinion and the top guys I know would say it does not matter, but in the end it\u2019s just our opinion and I can appreciate your desire for perfection.</p>",
