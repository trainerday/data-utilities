That seemed to work for me VERY well.</p>\n<p>Now riding outdoors with club etc, magically everything seems easier and faster not too mention I feel much better during and AFTER the rides.</p>\n<p>This Friday is the last day of my plan and I will take the 20min FTP test to see what actually did happen during the 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>Onto the question, now what?<br>\n<span class=\"hashtag\">#1</span>.

Like you said, \u2018everything seems easier\u2019 is the result of a good training plan. You not only increase pure wattage numbers, you also increase repeatability and capacity. Those will not show in FTP tests. If someone has 10W higher FTP but he can only do the effort once, all you need to do is attack twice with your 10W less ;-).<br>\nBy now, you should have a pretty good idea what works for you. Keep doing the things that clearly do, experiment a bit with the rest. But always make recovery a high priority. Otherwise you will burn out.</p>",

It\u2019s ok, meaning I believe fun, is very important and if more intensity is more fun for you that is great.  But our belief is you can start easy and end hard and get the same or better results then starting a plan moderate to hard and ending moderate to hard.  If you start easy and end hard, by the time you get to hard you are totally hungry for hard and the hard can be harder, or at the minimum equally as hard. But it\u2019s also true that people are different and can adapt a bit differently.  For short term gains pushing harder will get you there a bit faster, it\u2019s just you caused more stress, took more risk and in most cased no more benefit.</p>\n<p>Overall it seems the number of hours people ride a week has more of an impact on performance then what they do during the sessions.

Also short term hard work in general will make your FTP or at least your ramp test go up.  So having FTP as a goal is a bit of a slippery slope and is not always the best indicator of progress, yes year over year you ideally want your FTP to go up.</p>\n<p>It also feels good if it goes up in short term but as part of a good strategy it\u2019s not ideal to focus too much on this.  It\u2019s easy to game the system and only do stuff that shows FTP gains but long term that won\u2019t maximize your potential.  Year over year growth seems to come best from doing very traditional training.  Be consistent, increase your hours of training.  Do base, build, peak periods and at the end of peak ideally your FTP is up from the previous year.</p>\n<p>Not getting sick, injured or burned out as well as feeling amazing is the obviously optimum goal.

Sprint, short criteriums with lots of surges, mountain rides, time-trial, ultra-distance,\u2026?<br>\nYou can get \u2018faster\u2019 in general by repeating the same plan with an updated FTP. But during your journey, you must have sensed things that you were better at (or at par) then your friends, just like things that you were less good at. Where do you want to go now? Getting even better at the things you\u2019re already good at? Or do you want to address the things that didn\u2019t go that well? The answer to those questions probably depends on what kind of rides you like more or less. But it could also be that the rides you like most, are those where you\u2019re at your best\u2026<br>\nMy goal here is to make you think about the actual situation and where you want to go. Then you can make more specific choices for the harder workouts. More aerobic, threshold or anaerobic oriented. Probably also technique/agility/bike handling\u2026<br>\nThere is no \u2018one-fit-all\u2019 solution. But Base is the foundation for all of them.</p>",

During these rest days (minimum of five) you can either leave the bike entirely or, if the thought of not cycling at all freaks you out, you can do some recovery rides. If you don\u2019t cycle at all, make sure you do other things like walking or swimming. All at a very easy pace.</p>\n<p>I understand that you want to start a new program, but both Alex and MedTechCD gave you some very good advice.</p>\n<p>There is no point, doing a FTP Test every time you finish a program. The FTP test has its limitations. However it does take away some valuable time. You have to rest two days before testing and at least one day after testing. So every test takes away 4 days of valuable training time.</p>\n<p>Take a look at your heartrate- and powerzones first. Are you still in the right heart rate compared to the powerzone? If so there is no need for a ftp test. Sometimes your heartrate is higher indoors than it would be outdoors, especially with hard and hot indoor rides. But you\u2019ll see what I mean.</p>\n<p>To make your training more interesting MedTechCD\u2019s advice to take a look at what you\u2019re good at and get even better in that is a great tip.</p>\n<p>When I compare your weight to your height, you seem like a good climber. So Alex\u2019s advice to go for the bog climbs plan is great advice, too.</p>\n<p>To spice it up I would do a field test. You can do this on Rouvvy, Bkool, Zwift or whatever platform you\u2019re on. Pick a mountain. Take a longer climb that is not too steep. Set a time on that mountain. Do the big climbs plan, take two days of rest and ride the same mountain again.</p>\n<p>To sum it all up:<br>\nFive days of rest<br>\nPick a climb and set a time<br>\n12-16 week Big climbs plan<br>\nDo the same time again.</p>\n<p>Let me know if this works for you.</p>\n<p>Have fun</p>",

You might be able to replicate this performance gain once again but then you will see a diminishing return. Don\u2019t forget that elites have a decade or more of dedicated training behind them before becoming an elite. You can\u2019t expect to get similar results in a couple of months.

We\u2019re talking about 6 months to a year of consistent training here. Motivated and dedicated beginners will see huge gains during the first 6-12months. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t expect to keep growing at that pace.<br>\nReaching 90% of your potential becomes much more difficult. Structured and balanced training/recovery/periodisation are required on top of the consistency.<br>\nAnything above 90% of your potential, demands specific training routines and you will almost certainly need a coach or a lot of knowledge and self assessment awareness to keep improving.<br>\nThe fact that you were able to increase your FTP by 6% after all those years with high mileage, simply means that the chosen plan did a very good job.<br>\nAnd for the record, the link with comparative FTP in my former post is valid for people up to age of 40 years. After 40, performance in well trained athletes is decreasing or stagnates at best. You need to adapt your goal settings to something more realistic. If you never before trained in a structured way, there may still be room for improvement. But the fact that you already have a solid base means that you are close to that 90%.</p>",

The problem is you worked so hard and could likely have worked a lot less hard and gotten a similar level of gain.  So I understand it\u2019s all about expectations.  Really structured training is the icing on the cake. Consistency and volume are the cake itself.  Since you had the basics down, optimum workouts will give small incremental gains. You should be happy and now enjoy your season.  If you want ideas for next season just post questions here, and I would say don\u2019t kill yourself next year\u2026 smarter not harder.  Killing yourself can work, as it did in your case.  Hopefully you will not be burned out and it sounds like you did not get sick or injured so I call that a success as well.</p>",
