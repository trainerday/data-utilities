I suspect there\u2019s some technical blocker but it would be helpful to see where TP thinks I\u2019ll be for CTL / Fitness at the end of a training block. I feel silly asking because I\u2019m not all that serious a user of that feature as it is . . . but I do like to look at it to get a sense for where I might be in 3 - 4 months. . . and I don\u2019t do anything competitive so it\u2019s just for my own education (so I feel silly asking for it.)</p>",

PMC chart/data is very interesting information and great for learning.</p>\n<p>As a current solution, rather than use Calendar sync you could just send your plan to my plans and then send the entire plan to TP, but then if you want to make edits to CJ directly you have to delete everything in TP and resend it.</p>\n<p>We should allow 1 month or longer, we did it this way for performance reasons but we can revisit this but it won\u2019t likely happen very soon as my developer for this is very busy.</p>",
