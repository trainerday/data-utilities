      "cooked": "<p>To be honest, I don\u2019t think having a recommended workout section would work. I was looking for a way to find new workouts from search really. I think the recommended workouts could easily show a workout type and duration which doesn\u2019t fit in with a plan. Whereas when you can specify the workout type and duration in the search bar you will always get results which match your planned session.</p>\n<p>i.e. if I have recently done a 45 minute threshold workout, the day before that I did a two hour endurance ride. How would workout suggestions know that the following day I wanted to do a 30 minute anaerobic session?</p>\n<p>Maybe instead of having a button next to the search button, an additional filter button could be added which randomises the results. This way, the results could still be displayed from the search, using the default popularity filter, but then people could click the random filter button to jumble the search results. This would then result in people finding new and different workouts (utilising more of your database), but still fitting within the parameters of their planned session.</p>",
