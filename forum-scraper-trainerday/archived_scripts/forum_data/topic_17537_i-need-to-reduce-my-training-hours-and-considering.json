I\u2019ve trained like 10-16 hours a week for the past 10ish years, but now with life stuff I\u2019m bringing training down to like 8 hours/week avg.</p>\n<p>I recognize it\u2019ll be hard to be competitive in gravel and long road events, but I\u2019d love to continue racing at a cat 1/2 level in crits and XCO, and get into CX. I\u2019ve been researching self-coaching and the amount of information is overwhelming, so I\u2019m looking at TrainerDay as a potential option to free up my time and energy to just train and not worry about the planning. Unfortunately personal coaching just isn\u2019t in the budget right now.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m wondering if anyone has insight on if the Coach Jack plans are a good fit for my situation. Thanks for reading!</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Yes, if pre-season you just do what you can build up about 10% each week for 8 weeks above your desired average weekly (so 2 months above 8 hours a week), getting to the maximum possible say 12 or maybe one planned week of 16 (take a day off from work once a year), with the a decent plan you might be able to keep to a similar level you have now.  Again as I said find creative ways to find other zone 1/zone 2 efforts if that means \u201crucking\u201d while on walks or biking to work, taking the stairs more often, everything you can to get more aerobic hours per week especially during a winter period that might be lower cycling hours you really could hold on to some of what you have.  As you get down in hours even during a base phase you might want do do one day of HIIT for example.  What we can base + or base++</p>",
