In the right hands I guess there is nothing inheriently wrong with this, but I think it would be easy to obsess on this and miss the bigger picture.  I actually think this idea is interesting meaning, first you design what you believe is an optimal plan and then you kind of review this to see your TIZ \u201cflow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cycling math is very fun but like Dr Seiler says it causes a lot of problems, especially in the wrong hands. He is not a TIZ advocate per se, but more focused on one or two (if you ride a lot) hard rides a week in the most simplistic terms.  I fully agree with keeping the math simple.  Cycling math has caused what many belive are a lot of problems such as focusing on maximizing our CTL and FTP.  The guys I respect feel this is the wrong approach.  High FTP and CTL are byproducts not the goal.</p>\n<p>As you likely know TrainingPeaks online and IntervalsICU are good for designing plans focused on TSS managment. We opt for keeping to the real basics as much as possible.  I think TSB can be very useful.  I would say your best bet is to propose a weekly forward looking TIZ report to IntervalsICU and if David likes the idea you might get it rather quickly.</p>\n<p>Not sure this helps since it appears you have a different opinion but just providing insights into our thinking as it might help you or others a little.</p>",

This is where you need to look into Planned TiZ (among other things, of course).</p>\n<p>If you need to improve endurance, TTE, that\u2019s one way. If you gonna compete in crit, this is a totally different story, you need anaerobic power and you probably will gonna work in zones 5, 6 and up.</p>\n<p>All in all, I totally agree with you, that math is just a tool, not a goal. In wrong hands it indeed may bring more harm, than good. But one have to try and get her own experience. And it\u2019s important to constantly analyse if the designed plan indeed brings you expected benefits and works well. Trial and error, modify, test again etc. etc.</p>",
