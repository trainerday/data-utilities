I\u2019ve won the Green Jersey in Flamme Rouge Racing on Zwift and improved my w/kg to almost 12 from 9 in sprints<br>\nHowever my endurance and TTT have suffered big time. I just can\u2019t hang on either in time trials or races. My FTP has dropped from 2.48 to 2.18.<br>\nI\u2019m pretty clueless so any help would be appreciated. I have 2 rock solid commitments per week. 1 TTT and one race on Zwift, other than that I can commit to 4 to 5 training sessions per week ideally between 60-90 minutes per session.<br>\nShould I be looking at a particular plan in the Trainer Jack section(ie base or something else) or just do hr training using the Maffetone method? Or a combination of both?<br>\nAny help or advice would be very much appreciated.<br>\nThanks<br>\nJohn</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi John,</p>\n<p>To help you with this question you need to know a little bit more about your body. There are 2 types of muscle fibers. Type I and type II. The type I fibres are endurence fibres. They are perfect for long distances.<br>\nThe type II fibres can be devided into type IIa and type IIb. The type IIb fibres are dedicated to pure sprinting. Very explosive and excellent for very short durations at high power.<br>\nThe fibres I just explained are trainable within their functions and also define the baseline of the athlete. So Usain bolt has dominated the world 100m sprint for years simply because he has a lot of type IIb muscle fibers. Same as Tadej Pogacar has a lot of type I fibres.</p>\n<p>So, for these fibres your genetics lay the base foundation and you can only get so much better by training them specifically.</p>\n<p>The interesting part are the type IIa fibres. These fibres are anaerobic by nature. So high power output, but not as explosive as a sprint. Think powerzone 6. With training however, you can use these for endurance too.</p>\n<p>So, when your focus is completely on high intensity, these fibres will be highly anaerobic, making you a puncheur/ sprinter. When you focus is endurance only, these fibres will enhance your abillity to do longer rides.</p>\n<p>In your schedule there are a few things that (could) play part in your result.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The focus to do sprint training. What you train is what you get. I hope you understand this principle better. Want more endurance? You will need to train more endurance. Slow zone 2 trainingsessions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A lot of races. Racing every week is not a training. Race will drain you and most of the time they will overload our body too much. A regular training asks for a 6 - 48 hour recovery period, with 48 hours being the exception. A race usually needs at least 48 hours of recovery. So if you are doing two races every week it means that you will need 4 days of rest to recover from that. Together with the two days that you are racing on, you are left with one day of serious focussed training. You can do some recovery rides, but I hope you see that two races every week is not a recipe for better results.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally the duration of your training sessions. Since your focus seems to be racing on Zwift, you don\u2019t really need long trainingsessions. However a proper zone 2 training for an athlete like you will take at least 2 to 3 hours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There might be a nutrition part in this too, but let\u2019s not get in too deep. First focus on the right training plan.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My advice would be to choose a few (max once a month) races where you really want to be at your best. If the competition is more seasonal, only in spring for instance, that would be more difficult, but racing is draining and demanding.</p>\n<p>Build a program of two High intensity sessions per week. The rest of the week are easy, zone 2 trainings. You could use the polarised training program from coach Jack. You could even use the custom traininigs in the program. Do vo2 max and threshold.</p>\n<p>Make an effort to free up time to do one longer zone 2 session each week. This will make your baseline so much better.</p>\n<p>Have lots of fun training and racing</p>",
