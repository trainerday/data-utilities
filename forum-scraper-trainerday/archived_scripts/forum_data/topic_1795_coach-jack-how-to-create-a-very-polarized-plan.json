It will never be pure polairzed.</p>\n<p>If you want to take polarization to the extreme and quickly tweak to match your definition of polarized (because the definition has some flexibility).  You can see below an example of polarized.  Seilers pure definiton means 5 rides a week and 4 of them are easy.  A lot of people prefer time in zone and Dr Seiler points out that is likely to be closer to 90/10.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b01d80f7bc0aac8b9fc2b05aa5d1e05d5381fe79.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/b01d80f7bc0aac8b9fc2b05aa5d1e05d5381fe79\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b01d80f7bc0aac8b9fc2b05aa5d1e05d5381fe79_2_690x417.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"p7ZfgZDp1HJGRxRfy4fbeGVCiNP\" width=\"690\" height=\"417\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b01d80f7bc0aac8b9fc2b05aa5d1e05d5381fe79_2_690x417.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b01d80f7bc0aac8b9fc2b05aa5d1e05d5381fe79_2_1035x625.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b01d80f7bc0aac8b9fc2b05aa5d1e05d5381fe79_2_1380x834.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b01d80f7bc0aac8b9fc2b05aa5d1e05d5381fe79_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1904\u00d71152 206 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/21ccbe1c24c48d4f2d2c6e5e7d7a28afa7175ff3.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/21ccbe1c24c48d4f2d2c6e5e7d7a28afa7175ff3\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/21ccbe1c24c48d4f2d2c6e5e7d7a28afa7175ff3_2_690x418.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"4P0pLpewtJVxpAgzzcx4oNyXz9h\" width=\"690\" height=\"418\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/21ccbe1c24c48d4f2d2c6e5e7d7a28afa7175ff3_2_690x418.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/21ccbe1c24c48d4f2d2c6e5e7d7a28afa7175ff3_2_1035x627.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/21ccbe1c24c48d4f2d2c6e5e7d7a28afa7175ff3_2_1380x836.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/21ccbe1c24c48d4f2d2c6e5e7d7a28afa7175ff3_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">2114\u00d71282 212 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>These zone 2 rides are about 60% so pretty much guaranteed to be easy for everyone.

If you want to increase the ratio of hard for a longer duration plan just increase the intensity slider or add another day with some more hard intervals.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of flexibility here. 80/20 or 90/10 is a very rough estimate.  It does not need to be exact at all.  The point is do more easy and make sure your hard is hard, or in coach jacks case you slowly build up your hard.</p>\n<p>See below a 5 day a week plan, looking at time in zone this is probably closer to 90/10, with intensity level 3 and 2 vot max workouts a week or one, vo2 max and one hiit for example.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c39587fb3be6b5ef6f8edc42fd421026c9c5d80f.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/c39587fb3be6b5ef6f8edc42fd421026c9c5d80f\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c39587fb3be6b5ef6f8edc42fd421026c9c5d80f_2_690x218.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"rUdtv0dkwla6bae8U1e0umIKpQ3\" width=\"690\" height=\"218\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c39587fb3be6b5ef6f8edc42fd421026c9c5d80f_2_690x218.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c39587fb3be6b5ef6f8edc42fd421026c9c5d80f_2_1035x327.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c39587fb3be6b5ef6f8edc42fd421026c9c5d80f_2_1380x436.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c39587fb3be6b5ef6f8edc42fd421026c9c5d80f_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">2278\u00d7720 92.5 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>I have said this other places, but I will say it again here. I think the main idea behind polarized is good.  Less moderate intensity more easy rides, make sure you get some hard sessions in.  I think whether it is polarized or not the idea of more easy work seems to be well supported by many top coaches. Polarized training doesn\u2019t for example have a solution for periodization and no studies have been done to compare a classic periodization schedule (which seasonally is also likely to be 80/20 - 90/10), for example the old school Joe Friel and following Polarized all year long.  One big difference is that just prior to your desired peak, 4-8 weeks of focused event specific training, that is less polarized is what virtually all elites/pros do.</p>\n<p>Polarized plan is great in the fact that you don\u2019t need any planning.  If you just want to ride the same all year round and don\u2019t want to think about it then Polarized Training seems to give a accpetabl solutions to this.  My guess is that doing this would take you to a reasonable level of health, fitness and you would not burn out.  I would think most cyclists would plateau and break out of this plateau very slowly if at all.  I am not saying Polarized is wrong.  I am just saying it\u2019s only part of the equasion.</p>\n<p>The main point I believe Dr Seiler has proven is that putting max daily TSS as the primiry criteria for succes does not appear to be as successful as including a lot more easy sessions (lower TSS).  Doing huge amounts of sweet spot is equated to a very high CTL or TSS/day average.  It works for some people for a while, but not for most.  Doing the right training and recovery, and secondarily improving your CTL is more likely to give you what you want.</p>\n<p>To say it again, TSS, TSB, and CTL are very useful but maximum CTL should not be the primary goal.  My opinion is also that doing two VO2max a week is not likely the best plan, although if you take a polarized approach and really like VO2max it\u2019s likely to produce reasonable results.</p>\n<p>The most complicated part from my perspective is that many cyclists want a training plan to improve their performance in the winter and spend the outdoor season less structured.  Trying to create the perfect annual training plan in such a case is very difficult <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  What you don\u2019t want to do is kill yourself all winter to be burned out in the spring.  You can kill yourself in the winter but then you should probably do a mini-recovery aerobic period before the spring.</p>\n<p>I seem to repeat myself but I feel I come up with better ways of stating this.  Hope the above is helpful <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Yeah I totally agree,  I spent most of last winter doing Z2 and Z3 with a little bit V02 work mixed in (Friel over 50) and that worked well for me this year, plan to do pretty much the same this year, most of my plans for next year are endurance events, 100 mile plus off road</p>\n<p>My question was more aimed at the usablity of CJ, I\u2019ve played with it before and was impressed, and then followed your instuctions above and there are a lot of options (more than I rememmber last time) and you ordered the Zones (1 , 2 ,3) they other way up to way I expect to do it, and it had a very different effect on the output, I was just wondering if there was a resource / guide on using it (although the orignal post made things clearer for me, so maybe I should have just done the How to Create a very plarized plan as a training exercise)</p>\n<p>I think it\u2019s to easy to get dragged into the numbers, I am terrified when I look at my friends TSS / intensity / CTL on intervals and think \u201cam I doing enough\u201d, and then we ride and THEY struggle soooo much later in the ride</p>\n<p>I think to many people read to much into the  Dr Seiler  80/20, because of the intital study where the Norweigan Skiers were doing 80/20, and my taking from when I\u2019ve listerned to him is that you should ride as much as possible (Z2) and then add in as much intensity that you will recover from and be able to do the same again next week (not all year round,  that was just a general statement)</p>",

Generally human bodies are not a math equasion or at least not the simple ones we are using.  I need to create a Coach Jack Guide Video.  I hope to start doing more videos again soon.  It\u2019s pretty powerful now and we are working on improving the heart rate based training experience which even gives more training options.</p>",
