I was going to start a thread on this exact topic <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/medal_military.png?v=9\" title=\":medal_military:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":medal_military:\">. Good to see.</p>\n<p>I like <strong>Erg Mode</strong> for some structured workouts.  The use case is:  \u201cI want a <strong>% FTP</strong> that translates to a particular amount of work over a given time interval\u201d.  Remembering that <strong>power = torque * rpm</strong> we end up with <strong>torque = rpm / power</strong>.  If we agree that torque is the \u201cresistance I feel at the pedals\u201d, then resistance is constantly changing based on my pedalling speed. Faster pedalling = less torque and slower pedalling = more torque.  Erg mode is great for many things - especially coaches who want to specify a power number and let the bike get the rider to do the correct amount of work.</p>\n<p><strong>Sprint Interval Training</strong> is a different goal: \u201cGiven a specific gear or <strong>resistance level</strong>, what\u2019s the <strong>maximum power</strong> I can <em>achieve and/or hold</em> over a given time interval?\u201d For any given gear, <strong>power = torque * rpm</strong>.  If we agree that a <strong>gear</strong> translates to a <em>measure of resistance applied to the pedals (optimally based om rider weight)</em> then the <strong>power</strong> metric we are looking for is obtained by <strong>resistance * rpm</strong>.  The higher the rpm, the happier I am <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/partying_face.png?v=9\" title=\":partying_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":partying_face:\"> .</p>\n<p>I think <strong>Free-ride mode</strong> is the starting point. Instead of requiring me to manually select a virtual gear and watch the power reading, <strong>TrainerDay</strong> could set a virtual gear during each block based on <strong>%FTP</strong> or <strong>watts</strong>.  I can increase or decrease resistance with the <strong>-/+ 100% control</strong>. I still watch the power readings but I don\u2019t need to worry about resistance.  I don\u2019t do Zwift but I think this is a good description of their <em>slope mode</em>.  I can\u2019t find <em>resistance training</em> in any other smart bike software.  My NordicTrack S22i spin bike had a programmable resistance mode that changed only resistance.  <em>I used it all the time.</em></p>\n<p>Erg mode is good. <strong>Free-ride sprints</strong> are still the best for me, even if I have to manually set my resistance.</p>",

The use case is: \u201cLet me do a complete interval at a predetermined resistance level and see how I do in terms of power (watts)\u201d.  If I pedal faster, I do more work. Pedal slower and I do less work. When doing  intervals in this mode, the smart bike can set a calculated resistance level and doesn\u2019t need to hunt for a given wattage based on cadence like Erg mode has to.</p>\n<p><em>Think of this way.</em>  In <strong>Erg mode</strong>, I want to the bike to create a calculated amount of work over a time interval <em>regardless of cadence.</em>  This produces measurable results that can be used by coaches and riders to build and monitor a training plan. We get numbers like 400w for 1 minute.  That\u2019s fits nicely in spreadsheet and everyone is happy.</p>\n<p>In <strong>slope mode</strong> (I have already adopted your term Alex - thanks <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> ), I want to do strength training.  I want the bike to set an appropriate resistance that I use over a time interval.  The overall (a.k.a., average) work performed during the interval is less interesting than the associated telemetry. What were the maximum watts I hit? How long did stay at a given power level? What\u2019s my HR relative to resistance? What\u2019s the function - based on something like linear-regression -  that describes the work I did during the interval? I want it be a square wave.  But often - especially in the beginning - the curve will resemble a reverse saw tooth.  There are no convenient scalar values like  <em>400w for 1 min</em>.  It\u2019s more like <strong>resistance * sin(t)</strong>.  This not something every coach understands but could represent an opportunity for the next wave of training apps.  <em>Hint.

But often - especially in the beginning - the curve will resemble a reverse saw tooth. There are no convenient scalar values like <em>400w for 1 min</em>. It\u2019s more like <strong>resistance * sin(t)</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>So wouldn\u2019t this be similar in function to calculating normalized power for a specific interval? And from there you could calculation IF (intensity) of that interval.</p>\n<p>We are going to start adding an interval break down in our web app based on completed activities using our app and this could make it into the mix but I need to understand a little bit better what you are suggesting and ultimately what would I do with that data?  I guess generally you are saying to be able to compare one interval to the next and then one workout to interval to the next.  If you bring time into the equation then maybe it would be the TSS of the interval not of the workout. This is an interesting idea but I guess the value would be to monitor progress across different workouts but the problem is TSS is not super accurate for comparing a VO2max vs threshold unless you factor in someones W\u2019 \u2026 but still comparing two VO2max workouts it might be useful but again, W\u2019Bal might be the right way to look at that for workouts over threshold.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Great questions all around.  Let\u2019s get our terminology aligned and I think we will be fine. I suspect it <em>my terminology</em> that needs to improved - I haven\u2019t worked on these systems as long as you folks.</p>\n<p>I am going to back off calling one feature. I think there are two: <strong>Smart Resistance</strong> and <strong>Slope Mode</strong>.  I realize that <strong>Smarts Bikes</strong> (Wahoo Kickr Bike,  Wattbike Atom, Tacx Neo Bike and Stages SB20) and <strong>Smart Trainers</strong> (Wahoo Kickr, Saris H3, etc) are different.  <strong>Smarts Bikes</strong> can remotely set <strong>Resistance and Virtual Gear</strong>.  They can benefit from a <strong>Smart Resistance</strong> and ** Slope Mode**. <strong>Smarts Trainers</strong> can remotely set only  <strong>Resistance</strong>.  The rider <strong>must</strong> select a <strong>Physical Gear</strong> on their bike. They can benefit only from <strong>Slope Mode</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>How is a proposed <em>Smart Resistance</em> or <em>Slope Mode</em> different from the current <em>Free- Ride</em> mode?</strong></p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how I think <em>free-ride</em> works today - <em>If I am wrong please tell me - I will not be offended!!!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Free-Ride Mode</strong></p>\n<p>You create a workout in the TrainerDay editor to create <em>Interval Blocks</em>  based on %FTP or <strong>Desired Watts</strong>.  This result is: calculated <strong>Target Watts</strong> that will be used in each block when you do the workout in the TrainerDay App.  If I select <strong>Free-Ride</strong> in the TrainerDay App, nothing is done with the smart bike resistance control (I am guessing here!!!).  The goal of <strong>Free-Ride</strong> is to show the rider <strong>Target Watts</strong> for this <strong>Interval Block</strong>. The rider then selects a gear and cadence that lets them hit the  <strong>Target Watts</strong>.</p>\n<p>Proposed ** Smart Resistance** and ** Slope Mode**</p>\n<p>You create a workout in the TrainerDay editor to create <em>interval blocks</em>  based on %FTP or <strong>Desired Watts</strong>.  This result:  <strong>Target Watts</strong> that will be used in each block when you do the workout in the TrainerDay App.  If I select *<em>Smart Resistance</em> in the TrainerDay App, the <strong>resistance level and virtual gear</strong> on the Smart Bike is set automatically so I can \u201cjust ride\u201d.  TrainerDay sets a  <strong>Target Resistance</strong> and <strong>Target Gear</strong> for me.   <strong>Slope mode</strong> is similar.  TrainerDay sets only a  <strong>Target Resistance</strong>.  I set a  <strong>Virtual or Physical Gear</strong> for myself. Either what I may or may not achieve <strong>Target Watts</strong> - it all depends on how hard I work.  TrainerDay is helping by setting different <strong>Target Resistance</strong> in each block.</p>\n<p><strong>Target Resistance</strong> is simply a calculated amount of force relative to all the other <strong>Interval Blocks</strong>.  It will take me time to find the correct amount of force needed, so TrainerDay will need to assist  by giving me the ability to increase / decrease overall resistance so that <em>eventually</em> I automatically reach my  <strong>Target Watts</strong> without doing anything \u201cbut ride\u201d.</p>\n<p>A <em>Smart Bikes</em> can support both  <strong>Target Resistance</strong> and *<em>Slope Mode</em>.   <em>Smart Trainers</em> can support only  *<em>Slope Modes</em>.   If I were looking for an MVP, <strong>Slope Mode</strong> would do the job.</p>\n<p>BTW: I see some discussion about <strong>Sim mode</strong>.  I don\u2019t think this is a good term to show users. It is part of specs like Ant+ FE-C - so programmers will care.  Bike riders will do better something like \u201cslope\u201d which is the constant resistance you feel going up hill.  It\u2019s not perfect.  \u201cHeadwind\u201d is another possibility.  But it is not prefect either.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>I also like slope mode and it comes from the old compu-trainers I believe.  The problem that I have seen is that when setting a target in resistance mode (and I assume slope mode is the same) it can\u2019t really be connected to watts.  We could do it kind of like power match feature but that would be a bit of a mess and complicated.  Meaning look at the target slope, read the current watts and then try to adjust the slope to get it to the watts.  That would require some hunting around.</p>\n<p>I think a user would almost need to create special workouts just for this slope mode because each trainer and gearing would produce different watt outputs for specific slopes.  So you could create a workout with a warmup of 1% slope, followed by a threshold 8% slope and back to a 1% slope for a cool down.  Now that 8% slope would not actually be 100% of FTP it would just increase the resistance and get it in the ball park but the user creating the workout and doing the ride would have to fine tune this.  Sadly although I like the idea this is getting uglier\u2026   I am still not apposed to it as I think it might be interesting and once we do slope mode might be easy to implement.  I do like the training effect.  I might personally use this instead of ERG for harder efforts.</p>\n<p>Alternatively maybe we could just imporve our slope mode with giant buttons to increase.  Maybe two levels of buttons.  + 5% or + 1%.</p>\n<p>Just the idea I mean <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> Not real obviously<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/a664e27550791b462bfcf3e92e8de53686e489f3.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/a664e27550791b462bfcf3e92e8de53686e489f3\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/a664e27550791b462bfcf3e92e8de53686e489f3_2_556x500.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"nJZp4m0cIZcCFXnmvpcqcvZ03Rx\" width=\"556\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/a664e27550791b462bfcf3e92e8de53686e489f3_2_556x500.jpeg, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/a664e27550791b462bfcf3e92e8de53686e489f3.jpeg 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/a664e27550791b462bfcf3e92e8de53686e489f3.jpeg 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/a664e27550791b462bfcf3e92e8de53686e489f3_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">694\u00d7623 39.9 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",

The important part is to preserve the ratios for %FTP values in the workout. If 100% FTP maps to 10% slope, 50% FTP should map to 5% and 200% FTP should map to 20%. You can then use the -/+ controls to consistently scale the resistance level across the entire workout.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>",
