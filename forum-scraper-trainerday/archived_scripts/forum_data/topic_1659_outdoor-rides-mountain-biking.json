      "cooked": "<p>I do interval training indoors on a spin bike, I do it for cardio fitness primarily.  I\u2019ve been mountain biking since I was a kid - more serious than a recreational rider, but less so now that I\u2019m later in my adult life.  That said training with a power meter has opened up a new world for me especially since I\u2019ve coupled that with intervals.icu.</p>\n<p>My question is - I\u2019ve contemplated putting some power pedals on my mountain bike.  Seems the internet is all over the place on if this is useful or not.  From - it\u2019s no good due to all the spikes and the coasting you do when mountain biking, to it\u2019s only worth it if you\u2019re trying to win races - none of which I\u2019m doing.  I\u2019m doing XC biking, not downhill.  On the east coast of the US so mostly flat, rooty single track - elevation change in a ride is probably 500 ft\u2026maybe 1000\u2019 depending on where I ride.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve used Coach Jack plans and have substituted a \u201clong ride\u201d in the plan for a mountain bike trail ride - 10 miles, about an hour.  Intervals.icu reports this always and over exceeding compliance to plan metric (which I believe is based on training load).</p>\n<p>What\u2019s the consensus here for someone who\u2019s a recreational/sport mountain biker with a power meter in relation to interval training?  Would I gain anything?</p>",

I would actually like a PM on my MTB and can afford one right now but don\u2019t want to spend the money there and really appreciate the purity of just riding. No tracking at all.

With some user specific config for HR zones, you can get something similar but given the fact that HR is always lagging, you will never get an exact match. What is unusual however in your case, is that HR load is way higher then Power load. MTB is by definition way more variable then road riding, and will in most cases give you a higher load when using power.<br>\nThat is the reason why you should avoid using loads coming from different sources. Both HR based and Power based Load work quite well for the PMC chart on the condition you don\u2019t mix them. It\u2019s all relative and the trends will be very similar. The absolute values will differ.<br>\nThe TRIMP loads seem to be a better match (~10%), so if you can\u2019t use power based loads for all your activities, it might be better to use TRIMP or HR for all.<br>\nIntervals is giving you the choice what source you want to prioritize to calculate the load in the settings for the discipline.</p>",
