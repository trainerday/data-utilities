He does not pay for insurance policies. He does not buy fuel, does not pay for the necessary maintenance and repairs. He does not use paid parking. He does not cause serious accidents. He does not require multi-lane highways. He does not get fat.</p>\n<p>Healthy people are neither needed nor useful for the economy. They don\u2019t buy medicine. They do not go to hospitals or doctors. Nothing is added to the country\u2019s GDP (gross domestic product).</p>\n<p>On the contrary, every new McDonald\u2019s restaurant creates at least 30 jobs: 10 cardiologists, 10 dentists, 10 dietary experts and nutritionists, and obviously, people who work at the restaurant itself.\"</p>\n<p>Choose carefully: cyclist or McDonald\u2019s? It is worth considering.</p>\n<p>P.S. Walking is even worse. Pedestrians don\u2019t even buy bicycles.</p>",
