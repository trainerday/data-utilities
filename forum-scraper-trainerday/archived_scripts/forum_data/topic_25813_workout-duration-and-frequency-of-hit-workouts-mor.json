      "cooked": "<p>Hello Trainerday community,</p>\n<p>I was wondering if splitting workouts such as 4x8 @ 105\u2026108% FTP or 2x20@sweetspot intensity give the same benefit on endurance and VO2max when they are split into 2 workouts on subsequent days (2x8 or 1x20).</p>\n<p>Is time in zone per week key or is the development of the VO2 (slow component) much better in longer workouts?</p>\n<p>For me it is much easier to fit shorter workouts into my day but do them more frequently. Furthermore, my fatigue seems to be better when doing many shorter workouts.</p>\n<p>Is there any science on it that is concerned about arhletes? I could only find that for untrained and obese people many short workouts are beneficial.</p>\n<p>Longer rides on the weekend in the aerobic domain are included in weekly training.</p>",
