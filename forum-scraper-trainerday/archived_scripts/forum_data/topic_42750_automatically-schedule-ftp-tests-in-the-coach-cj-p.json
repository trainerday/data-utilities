My focus was to ride a lot of Z2 (based on my power) to build a decent base. It would be nice to incorporate an FTP test somewhere inside the plan if the plan duration would be substantial enough to produce developments. Especially so when the plan consists of more than one block. It would be good to re-calibrate the numbers and maybe, something to look forward to (like a reward of sorts) to spice up and keep you motivated. After all, who doesn\u2019t want to keep going if training gets you a new number to talk about with your buds. Cheers!</p>",

Obviously we \u201cgive it to you\u201d very straight<br>\n, zero gamification or trying to \u201chook people.\u201d   I personally love to try to do everything \u201cright\u201d which means attempting to follow time proven strategies and up to date solid science.  This is not the most \u201csticky\u201d approach.  At first we started as a platform for people that were mostly do it yourselfers and as we transition into something for a wider audience you are right, things need to be more clear and motivational.</p>\n<p>Sorry for such a long story\u2026 anyway, I am a strong believer that FTP tests should be fit in when it feels like the right time and it is very individual.  But still our product should facilitate this, I agree 100% and we will do this as soon as I can figure out the best strategy <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">   I am actually more interested in aerobic improvement rather than FTP TEST improvement and feel most people would benefit more from this approach.  The problem with FTP TESTS is people get addicted to trying to maintain the highest FTP or keep improving FTP and this is actually a poor approach to maximum performance and health.  Ok sorry again\u2026 I am getting deep here <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>It\u2019s a great question / suggestion that I am very passionate about.</p>",

I\u2019ve been following the workouts for about 7 weeks and once I noticed that I have somewhat improved, I wondered whether I perceive the current FTP/power zones a bit easier. I want to keep on improving and so I am looking at quantifiable metrics to ensure that I am challenging my system enough.</p>",

Different people should do FTP tests on different schedules.  Partially I think testing should be based on feel.  I feel excited, I am curious, I have not tested in 6-8 weeks ok let\u2019s do an FTP test today for a workout or in addition to my workout.  But some how it would be nice if we could formulate that.   If you have gone 7 weeks and starting from a lower level of cycling fitness it\u2019s probably a good time.</p>",
