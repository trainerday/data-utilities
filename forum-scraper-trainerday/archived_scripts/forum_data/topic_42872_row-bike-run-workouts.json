I\u2019m trying something new now as the title suggests, running cycling and rowing, mainly to reduce the amount of running injuries i get, and I think it is a good plan as I am not getting any younger. I was happily surprised to find rowing workouts now available here and i look forward to trying them. Just trying t get everything synced at the moment. Has anyone tried the 3 disciplines together any ideas for how to plan them all together? (to start with i\u2019m going to do 2 days a week on each sport\u2026mainly endurance and VO2 max workouts.)</p>",

I also believe in this same strategy and have a rowing machine but after years of doing the bare minimum I am just ramping up my cycling but would love to do all 3 + weight training.   I think it is a very good strategy especially if you can get the right recovery in and dial in the intensity.   If you want, let me know and I can ask him to share his experience here.  He seems happy to share knowledge.</p>\n<p>He does serious multi-day across Africa bike trips and stuff but he considers rowing his primary sport.</p>\n<p>Not sure if he profile is public.</p><aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/440586\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/e/ea5d9201d2d3a084d1e340859c2ef1c34101a7a3.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"FF6C24\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/440586\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Strava</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:535/114;\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/5/526a0377f8164a9d5397d1bb056c434610329b71.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"FC4C02\" width=\"535\" height=\"114\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/440586\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Signup for free to see more about Johan B</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Join Johan B and get inspired for your next workout</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>Rowing is not big in TrainerDay.
