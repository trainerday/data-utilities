      "cooked": "<p>I don\u2019t think this is an issue with TD but I\u2019m still confused and after some help</p>\n<p>When I started using TD I noticed my speed and distance for completed workouts was off (about half what I\u2019d expect) but being as in reality I was completely stationary for the whole time I didn\u2019t bother about it but recently it\u2019s been bugging me a bit as I\u2019d prefer it to be zero or accurate for my overall stats so I tried to figure out how to correct it. I was assuming there was a setting somewhere in the turbo trainer or in TD but I\u2019ve failed to solve it so looking for some help.</p>\n<p>I assume the measurement comes directly from the turbo trainer (a Zwift Hub) and because I only use ERG mode via TD the only way I figure it can know how fast I\u2019m going is to know the size of the gear I\u2019m using and my cadence.</p>\n<p>TD can see my cadence so it must be coming from the Zwift Hub although I\u2019m not sure how it knows it. I have a crank mounted Garmin ANT+ cadence sensor which it might be picking up (although unlike my ANT+ HR strap it isn\u2019t obviously paired to the Zwift hub so maybe not) or it might be trying to work it out but in any event it seems accurate (I will test it against a reading from my Garmin head unit connected directly to the cadence sensor next time I ride)</p>\n<p>For the size of my gear I\u2019m a bit stumped. Unlike my previous trainer there appears to be no settings in the Zwift app or companion app other than firmware update and spin down calibration so I\u2019ve no idea how it knows the size of my gear at all. Given I only use ERG mode I obviously just stay in one gear and I\u2019d like to set that gear to be one that gives me a reasonable real world speed/distance for the watts I\u2019m putting out in the workout (see this site for an excellent way to estimate this <a href=\"https://www.gribble.org/cycling/power_v_speed.html\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">An interactive model-based calculator of cycling power vs. speed</a> - e.g. 1 hour at ave of 200w = about 34km for me in the real world so at ave 70rpm i\u2019d need to set it up with a gear of about 8.1m to get the right sort of readings for an indoor workout)</p>\n<p>So\u2026 any ideas on how to correct my speed/distance showing in TD with my current set up? All thoughts and ideas gladly received!</p>",

As you know some people ride more aero, or are drafting and that would affect speed to power ratio.</p>\n<p>Also if you have maps enabled in strava settings especially climbs then your speeds will be much slower.

This seems too slow to me. In the real world if I\u2019d done 160w for 107 minutes I\u2019d have been going about 31kph and covered about 56km by my estimations.</p>\n<p>Have I got my maths all wrong here or is something off somewhere?</p>",

This was my point that this value can be all over the place and why we don\u2019t use it.  Glad you found the source of your problem.  You can stop syncing Garmin or you could use RunGap if you are iOS user to sync TD to garmin.</p>",
