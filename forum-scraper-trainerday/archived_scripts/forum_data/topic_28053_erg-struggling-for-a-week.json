(Elite Direto X + Samsung A52S 5G)</p>\n<p>However, tonight, I discovered that riding with a lighter gear (primarily in the cassette) makes the trainer\u2019s reaction almost immediate. The resistance increases or decreases in sync with the app.</p>\n<p>It might sound like a stupid solution, and perhaps you were already aware of it, but it works, \u201crepetita juvant\u201d.</p>\n<p>Now, riding is a pleasure without constantly pushing any buttons.<br>\nGreat app.</p>\n<p>Giancarlo</p>",
