Trainer day gave me an average of 126 for the 40 mn workout and garmin with chest strap gave me 119. I did the zone 2 test workout but not really sure on how i can tell that my breathing has changed. It seems like i was able to talk the same at 131. Anyway, garmin zone 2 is 128-143. so right now TD is giving me zone 1. now if i look at the zone with Whoop, i am in zone 2 (60-69%). Is garmin computing zone 2 wrong ? which data should i follow ?</p>",

He is a true expert in this space and his formula has worked for 10s of thousands of runners and many cyclists as well.  It factors in your health and recent years improvement trends, but he plays it very safe as he feels it is better to be under your limit than over.  Really his formula should be right below this talk/breathing change.  This might start around 65%, for some people this might be closer to 70% and over time with this training for some it can build, but start on the safe side.</p>\n<p>So the middle of \u201cZone 2\u201d feels very easy at first but say you do 100 days in a row, your power might go up 20% in that time and it won\u2019t be as easy any more.</p>\n<p>Top athletes say that it gets to the point that this is so hard they prefer doing intervals at \u201czone 2.\u201d   With running I experienced this that it started out almost impossible to run at 65% because it was so easy and at the end I felt pretty fast and would slow down some times <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",

Do this for 60-100 workouts.</p>\n<p>I did 100 days in a row running 30 minutes a day and saw serious aerobic progress and related, at least perceived, health benefits.  Do a MAF test, which means just a standardized zone 2 test (our HR mode @ 126) and measure your average power for the zone 2 segment.  Each week just do this test.  Because of the way this works on the trainer, every ride is a test <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  So once you are seeing progress aerobic progress (average power going up) it should stay consistent for a while.  Other signs you will see is originally you might have decoupling where your power keeps going down.  As you become fat adapted or fully zone 2 then the power should stay consistent during a 60 minute zone 2 workout.</p>\n<p>To make this really work you should kill pre-ride carbs or possibly all food an hour before you workout. This helps ensure you are using fat for fuel.  Most protein drinks have a lot of carbs <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  I would guess salads are not so hard on you but each person is unique.  Anyway once you have established a pattern of consistent progress you can start adding in a weekly hard ride and see what happens to this aerobic progress. Some people this might slow progress and others it will not.</p>",

If you are not fat adapted your body will take protein; (eggs, chicken, protein shakes) and convert the protein chains into glucose and you won\u2019t burn fat. Worse is if you run out of protein that is not yet stored as of all things fat, then the body will continue to make glucose from protein it will just take it from your muscles. This is why sweet spot athletes that don\u2019t pump in the carbs all the time don\u2019t make gains. Those athletes reach a plateau where they break down the muscles they are building.  So if not high fat diet try to always ride 1hr 15min to flip to fat burning and avoid protein uptake in the 3 hours before the ride. then you\u2019ll get a solid 30 minute in the fat melting zone. If you are a bullet proof (aka butter coffee) person (Keto or normal diet ); a cup of that a hour before the ride will setup you up for success because the body will go fat hah we have plenty of that coming in; lets go burn some of that abundance.</p>\n<p>Protein goes in after the ride; when your are stabilizing\u2026</p>",

Can you provide a source or sources?  I would love to read more.  You are ultimately saying what I believe Maffetone is stating but just from a different angle.  My experience was that once I was fat adapted I could go on a run for 2 hours fasted without a problem.  Ok at the end I was getting hungry <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> but did not feel a shortage of energy other than 2 hour runs were long for me.</p>",

But yes for now here\u2019s the sound bites I\u2019d give a new client. Want to do a fat burner ride.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If you are a Carb powered person, and I means 20th-century carbs Wheat, Sugar, Rice.<br>\nYou will have plenty of carbs on board, No fuel 3 hours before aerobic rides. Drink water during ride.  You will need 30 minutes to burn off the blood sugar you have. At 30 minutes onward you will burn fat if you stay below your Aerobic ceiling. If you go over it you will pull glucose from the muscles instead of burning fat; then you need to do another 30 minutes before you can get to fat so low and slow is your winner. More on this later. (Note if you are a carb person and you do high output; be absolutely sure to put carbs in)\u2026</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are Atkins-style Protein powers or Paleo (sometimes Mediterranean diet). You can eat right up to the ride your Complex carbs, easy on the protein. So you want a bowl of spinach, go for it. No Nuts, Steak or Eggs 3 hours before your ride. You will burn fat from about 15-20 minutes in. Pack in the protein after the ride. This is a special case, you can\u2019t really screw up on the short term but you can create a hidden limiter like a wrong turn in a maze.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are Keto Fat powered or attempting to drop 1-2 lbs of body fat per week. Have your butter coffee 45 minutes before the ride or go in fasted.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The short version is your Brain can only burn Glucose; the brain will protect itself at all costs; when we work on these edge cases you will always lead with your head and where you head goes the body follows;</p>\n<p>More to follow; these are great questions to ask; wanting to get there is 90% of the secret so bravo!</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: not a doctor just a coach with data\u2026 <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",
