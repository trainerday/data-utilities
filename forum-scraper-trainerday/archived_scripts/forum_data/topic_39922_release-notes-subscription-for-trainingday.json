It would be great to receive a brief summary of what\u2019s new with each version, or perhaps a weekly/monthly digest of updates.</p>\n<p>This would be a fantastic way to stay informed about all the cool new features that might be hidden deep within the menus, and it would help ensure that users are getting the most out of TrainingDay.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it would be helpful to have a \u201cWhat\u2019s New\u201d screen appear upon the first login to the website or app after an update. This screen could display a list of the new features and improvements, with buttons for \u201cGot it\u201d and \u201cRemind me later,\u201d allowing users to quickly see what\u2019s changed and choose how they want to engage with the new information.</p>\n<p>These features would be a fantastic way to stay informed about all the cool new features and ensure that users are getting the most out of TrainingDay.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Yes, I need to figure out a better solution. We have notifications now on the website if I create a new feature item here in the forum.  I should probably do like a monthly release notes since we have new items being release a few times a week on most weeks.  Most are so small that no one would care. Or they resolve one persons problem\u2026 Usually if it\u2019s something really important I create a blog post, video, email blast\u2026 but lately it\u2019s mostly small incremental stuff but I realize some times some of those small items can be interesting as well so yes I agree with you.  I will create myself a monthly reminder to do this.  It\u2019s a good start.</p>\n<p>For example yesterday we made this section smaller and are working towards a new improved ,simplified design\u2026 It\u2019s looks simple but it was not <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">  Does anyone really care <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3c0b2b88eeb147ac0a5ec0e601fe0b339257f0af.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/3c0b2b88eeb147ac0a5ec0e601fe0b339257f0af\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/3c0b2b88eeb147ac0a5ec0e601fe0b339257f0af_2_690x232.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"8zazXobwwYRnBvpwfKTY10OPQ0n\" width=\"690\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/3c0b2b88eeb147ac0a5ec0e601fe0b339257f0af_2_690x232.jpeg, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3c0b2b88eeb147ac0a5ec0e601fe0b339257f0af.jpeg 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3c0b2b88eeb147ac0a5ec0e601fe0b339257f0af.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"656A6C\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">886\u00d7298 40.7 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",
