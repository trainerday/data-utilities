Lots of benefits of HR for me: less worried about a calibrated power meter, and the workout is effectively auto-adjusted for my fatigue because the power will adjust to match how hard I am working.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Technically, if it was easy, everyone would have solved it by now, so three years isn\u2019t that long.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll put the primer ideas down now and then come back to discuss; today is oddly overbooked with items that control the success of the coming week, so I don\u2019t quite possess the time to do this correctly in one go.</p>\n<p>First, some background. I have had the pleasure to work with and train a group of athletes in the 45-70-year-old range. During that time I progress myself from 45-54 after having started in the biking space at age 19. I have done the time-crunched athlete myth myself and coached others through it. I have watched person after person doing that approach; make incredible gains; experience margin success, and then crash and burn from injury or burn out many not to return\u2026 So I bring that bias, I am ok with that, it\u2019s a demon I\u2019ll have to fight like everyone. I also want quick, easy wins so the siren song of time crunch solutions is tempting\u2026 Fortunately, maturity has taught me to drop the ideal of \u201cquickly\u201d from my models and redefine what \u201ceasy\u201d means so I can resist.</p>\n<p>So what\u2019s the driving goal of many people I work with? Simple, they want to ride or race bikes; I get both types. They all want to experience a more comfortable ride; they want to go fast outside, and they want to stay fit either competitively or for the sake of health. Oh, and if they see a bike in front of them, they want to chase that rabbit and show no pain as they pass them. It should sound familiar, and you all can fill in the blanks. Everyone one loves to talk while everyone else can only suck air.</p>\n<p>When people stumble on me and the help I offer, they are all aerobic disasters; they have no base built because they train or ride in Tempo on group rides or are locked into the time crunch FTP chasing ego cycle.</p>\n<p>So for myself and my circle, once I noticed this pattern I set about trying to find a better way to do it; and as luck would have it I found Phil Mafatone\u2019s writings and decided he might just be onto something. So let\u2019s test it! I lean towards a lab scientist any how (Engineer by wallet is my preference, you never know until you put it on the road). After a bunch of research and self-testing, we used this to coach up an over 50 mixed-gender RAAM relay team of four. Using this approach, they broke the record for a team of four. ((Granted they are also exceptional athletes to start with))</p>\n<p>I modeled this success back to a structured training approach with those roots.</p>\n<p>(Yes that opening is a mess because it discusses the past with the foresight of the future)</p>\n<p>So on to it, first FTP everything is FTP. FTP is a blessing and a curse. It\u2019s time to move beyond FTP and start thinking about Critical Power and specifically Critical Aerobic Power and Critical Anerobic Power. If you know your CAP(s), you know your abilities.</p>\n<p>Failing back on MAF is the way to make this transition easier. Very few of us will go out and do the ventilatory testing to figure out what our Aerobic thresholds are, and we don\u2019t have to if we are either (1) starting training off the couch, (2) already well-trained at the end of a season. In those cases, the formulas Phil put forth do work. Only the 3rd group of Time crunched \u201cfit,\u201d but unfit people will struggle because that\u2019s not about training. It\u2019s about ego and bro science.</p>\n<p>Ok, so MAF first, let\u2019s go with the most robust stance.</p>\n<p>MAF_Basis = 180 - age</p>\n<p>If you are severely detrained or currently sick, then</p>\n<pre><code>       MAF_Adjust1 = -10\n</code></pre>\n<p>Else<br>\nMAF_Adjust1 = 0<br>\nEndIF</p>\n<p>If you take daily medicine that has a liver load (aka heart meds, allergy meds), then</p>\n<pre><code>      MAF_Adjust2 = -5\n</code></pre>\n<p>Else<br>\nMAF_Adjust2 = 0<br>\nEndIF</p>\n<p>If MAF_Adjust1 + MAF_Adjust2 = 0 and you have been athletically training for three years plus without a significant injury, then.</p>\n<pre><code>     MAF_Adjust3 = +5\n</code></pre>\n<p>Else<br>\nMAF_Adjust3 = 0<br>\nEndIF</p>\n<p>So with those in hand, we know that the final estimate that works for pretty much everyone is</p>\n<p>MAF_Threshold_Estimate = MAF_Basis + MAF_Adjust1 + MAF_Adjust2 + MAF_Adjust3</p>\n<p>Now you have your MAF_TE to work with.</p>\n<p>And, of course, everyone in group three believes that  (MAF_Basis + MAF_Adjust3) is them and that it\u2019s too low. And reality shows that 90% of people are really (MAF_Basis - 15)</p>\n<p><strong>Ok, hopefully, you\u2019re with me so far. That part was the easy part; here\u2019s the part I will have time to cover today</strong></p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at how we\u2019d use an existing training software with a similar name to TrainerDay and one with Volcanoes. In that software, we work with FTP, and for this exercise, during the BASE building phase, we will treat Critical Aerobic Power as FTP as displayed in those apps.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Start with a Traditional base plan that is a low-volume or mid-volume plan in said software. One that\u2019s 100% endurance riding with recovery weeks. Watch out for things that claim to be traditional-based but have tempo and other work in them for \u201cvariety\u201d. Also, an Endurance ride is always &gt;= 90 minutes. You will have to delete tempo work and find endurance work from prebuilt plans. (If you have a training-peaks account, you can get me to build your plans, and I\u2019ll load one of many combinations for you, but really anyone can do it).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are off the couch, guess your FTP and enter it into the software. If you are ending the season and rebuilding, take your current FTP and use FTP-15. If you are in Ego group 3, then just use your FTP and follow the rest of the rules and put the ego in the garage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Begin riding your first endurance ride. Complete the warm-up. Then 5 minutes after the warmup, If your measured HR is below MAF_TE, then increase the difficulty of the workout using the percentage gauge or equivalent mechanism.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If your measure HR at any time is close to going over MAF_TE, then decrease difficulty. During the <strong>Peak parts of the workout</strong>, you want to be in the range of <strong>MAF_TE - 10 &lt;= Measured HR &lt;= MAF_TE -5</strong>  That\u2019s the sweet spot for the peak of the workout. When building the workouts, we want at least 30 minutes total to be that intense. Never less that that; and sometimes a lot more minutes to put cardiac drift strain on the athlete. A workout that forces the person to keep lowering the difficulting to keep the HR in the zone; is not a bad workout; it\u2019s an Endurance building workout. (((Important not to see those as failing because it\u2019s not)))  Overshooting MAF_TE is to be avoided at all costs. One minute over can derate the workout about 80% so don\u2019t do it.  <strong>Re-read this until you understand it</strong> Cardicate drift is going to happen lower the difficulty is HR training; it\u2019s not a failure\u2026</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Continue to adjust throughout the workout.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After the workout is done, consider what your average % adjustment was that kept you just under MAF_TE</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adjust your FTP estimate by that %. If step 6 felt like +6% then increase FTP +6% if step six felt like -20%, then set FTP to FTP_estimate * .8</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>repeat starting at step 3 on the next ride.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By the end of 2 weeks, you should find that you have to do little to no adjustment, and you\u2019ll be pretty close to an FTP that complies with your current Critical Aerobic Power base.</p>\n<p>Finish the rest of the six to ten weeks on a traditional base. Six weeks if you are resetting after a season. Eight weeks if you are a recovering FTP junky, and ten if you are off the couch or trying to lose weight. During this time frame, you adhere to: <strong>MAF_TE - 10 &lt;= Measured HR &lt;= MAF_TE -5</strong></p>\n<p>If you have the time, you can loop through the base phase for as long as you like. Each loop-through will build more and more CAP. This is great for older folks or injury recovery. With the traditional software, you can watch your progress via CAP expressed as FTP. When FTP stops going up for an entire loop, then it\u2019s time to move to Polarized no matter what.</p>\n<p>Now credit where credit is due. TR\u2019s AI FTP detection works spectacularly well at tracking your Aerobic FTP done as above and can avoid any testing to figure out when to increase your FTP-driven software to higher levels (makes for a heck of cross-check to your work). Almost makes their monthly subscription worth it just to pump the data into there for analysis. For a self-coached person, I would recommend that subscription over training peaks as you\u2019d get more from it as an amateur, even if your primary app is Trainerday, zwift, or a host of others. Once someone implements HR structured training, you would not need that AI analysis or you could use it for validation of plan.</p>\n<p>At the end of the Base phase, you will switch to a Polarized plan in 4-6 week blocks, where the final week is a proper recovery week. The build weeks will be. 1-2 Hard workouts each week. 1-3 Easy recovery rides in the 75-90 minute range. And 2 Longer Endurance rides. For best results, these will be 4 to 7 days per week of training. If we use traditional software, we will use their FTP measure to track Critical Anaerobic Power. Your Critical Aerobic power will be preserved by the two long endurance rides each week, and you can start stacking the two on top of one another.</p>\n<p>If you do this correctly after eight weeks, you should find that historically championed SweetSpot workouts can be done around MAF_Basis+5. If you can\u2019t, then your FTP as an expression of your Critical Anerobic Power is overstated.</p>\n<p>At the risk of annoying some people. If your traditional FTP as defined by the old school  is correct for your abilities, it should always be easy to do SweetSpot work at HR &lt;= MAF_Basis (\u00b15) on a rested day. If you can\u2019t do a sweet spot at that HR level, then while you can test at an FTP higher than this level, you have no hope of holding your FTP for the true full 1 hour out on the road. Your Time to Exhaustion will be your limiter because your CAP(s) are incorrectly understood.</p>\n<p>Ok, that\u2019s a cut and paste of several things; I didn\u2019t really get into how the Polarized stuff goes or why we need to have a \u201cstructured HR\u201d workout and not just ride at in the MAF_TE zone the entire workout, or why Cardiac Drifting (Not Tokoya Drifing) workouts matter.</p>\n<p>I think the first goal is to get the software to manage the Base Phase Limiters automatically. Once it can do that with good reliability, then digging in on the Endurance Structured rides becomes exciting beyond belief.</p>\n<p>I can currently get an athlete to execute the above with Active Coaching; I would like to see it brought to a broader audience through software.</p>\n<p><strong>Edited for readability and to clarify a few things</strong></p>",

I have had the pleasure to work with and train a group of athletes in the 45-70-year-old range. During that time I progress myself from 45-54 after having started in the biking space at age 19. I have done the time-crunched athlete myth myself and coached others through it. I have watched person after person doing that approach; make incredible gains; experience margin success, and then crash and burn from injury or burn out many not to return\u2026 So I bring that bias, I am ok with that, it\u2019s a demon I\u2019ll have to fight like everyone. I also want quick, easy wins so the siren song of time crunch solutions is tempting\u2026 Fortunately, maturity has taught me to drop the ideal of \u201cquickly\u201d from my models and redefine what \u201ceasy\u201d means so I can resist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>",

      "cooked": "<p>I went through my first ride after work today using the HR control using the Quick Ride feature and I was thrilled with how well it worked.  It did just what I wanted it to do.</p>\n<p>How can I control the time of the ride though?  Is Quick Ride the only way to do a HR controlled ride?  If I check the extended cool down box in the options is that a way to go longer than the 60 minute Quick Ride duration?</p>\n<p>I completed a Zwift ramp power test on Saturday and failed during the 300 watt portion.  It gave me an FTP of 212.  My new zone 2 using the Coggan zones then is 117-159 watts.</p>\n<p>As you can see in the screen capture I\u2019m running roughly 1:1 HR to power so if I want to hold 127 bpm HR I average about 123 watts.  I can do that ride daily without building up much fatigue.</p>\n<p>If I try to hold 159 watts for an hour I\u2019m going to end up fatigued.  Has Zwift given me a \u201cvanity FTP\u201d?  I could go through and do a true 30 or 60 minute FTP effort, but those tests make you suffer and I\u2019m not really motivated enough to want to go through that right now.  I just want to build up my aerobic base.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c285e2e449dcf8ae1d6d6ee1b9f322a0c15cb2b5.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/c285e2e449dcf8ae1d6d6ee1b9f322a0c15cb2b5\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c285e2e449dcf8ae1d6d6ee1b9f322a0c15cb2b5_2_689x187.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"rKPtIyvN9yXz9KYCv2yqinY0jt3\" width=\"689\" height=\"187\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c285e2e449dcf8ae1d6d6ee1b9f322a0c15cb2b5_2_689x187.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c285e2e449dcf8ae1d6d6ee1b9f322a0c15cb2b5_2_1033x280.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c285e2e449dcf8ae1d6d6ee1b9f322a0c15cb2b5.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c285e2e449dcf8ae1d6d6ee1b9f322a0c15cb2b5_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1148\u00d7312 28.5 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>Dave</p>",
