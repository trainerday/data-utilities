      "cooked": "<p>Sorry I am likely to confuse you even more :)\u2026</p>\n<p>So, I am big Maffetone fan, and while I love Seiler\u2019s core message, and he proved at some level that in the short term his 80/20 is better than 4 weekly sweet spot workouts.  I think the main advantage of Seiler\u2019s approach is it is a dead simple training plan and it is a reasonable approach.  I think it misses some core fundamentals of training.   So I believe unless you are seeking dead simple annual training plan with no periodization I don\u2019t think it\u2019s optimum, but at the same time their is no \u201cproof\u201d that what I am suggesting is correct.  One of the big benefits of hard VO2max training is that it taxes both your aerobic system and your anaerobic system.  This produces fast results to reach peak performance.  Long term you really only need to reach peak performance prior to race or event season which for most here is outdoors in the late spring.</p>\n<p>So optimizing short term anaerobic gains for a long time does not make a lot of sense. It causes a lot of stress with limited benefit.  You can only improve anaerobically for about 8-16 weeks. So taking more of a progressive approach makes a lot more sense. And focusing your hardest efforts (including 4X8) to a peak period of training. Also I would say very few elites follow Seiler\u2019s training approach.  I agree 100% they are polarized in their training intensities but almost all have a much more heavily periodized approach with more variety in training intensities and types including many or most still do pure base periods (no idea what %).</p>\n<p>So for Seiler, he likes indoor Zwift races year round I believe, so really for him yearly polarized makes a lot more sense.  Keep in top form all year round without burning yourself out.  But I don\u2019t think this optimizes for long term to get small increases each year, it\u2019s much more likely to peak and just stay there.</p>\n<p>So if your desires are closer aligned with what I believe his are then it\u2019s likely good.</p>\n<p>So with regards to Maffetone, I think you are missing one of the most fundamental points he makes.  Which is start pure 100% below AeT (low heart rate) training and monitor your progress with MAF tests.  Seeing continual improvement between HR/power ratio will inspire you to keep doing it, once you start seeing this improvement then you can try adding in more anaerobic or hard training 1 day a week and see if that stalls your aerobic improvement.  If it does STOP and go back to pure base. I personally have gone through and witnessed both the progress and the stopping of progress by adding more and more intensity.</p>\n<p>You could try by starting with this hybrid approach but then if you are not seeing aerobic progress because you are not following Maffetone\u2019s suggestion everything gets a bit more scary and you might think you must go back to traditional training\u2026  If you sleep very well, get super good recovery, low stress life, not too old and do his fasted zone 2 rides, so everything correct except you add a 4x8 once a week, the risks are reduced that you won\u2019t see progress.</p>\n<p>So I would say either you buy into Maffetone or you don\u2019t <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">   I think if you understood how small the risk is you would jump into this no problem.  You will start feeling out of shape and this is scary but hopefully you starts seeing MAF test progress before that happens, it lowers the scariness <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>So I know I have not answered all questions here,  but helped give something to chew on.</p>",

Again this partially depends on training volume and your ability to recover. Some people can handle higher ratios because they recover fast enough and do better with a less polarized approach at least for part of the year.</p>\n<p>Seiler suggests 90/10 year round which means you are not periodizing your training intensities.</p>",

Also your breathing can drastically affect hr/power as well as temperature and pre-training activities.  It\u2019s pretty sensitive but you will see a clear pattern over a period of time if it is working.</p>\n<p>The biggest goal from all of this is to turn your body into an incredibly efficient fat burner.  So just like Mark Allen experienced at first it felt incredibly easy and after a long time of pure low HR training (I don\u2019t remember how long) that his body is so efficient that he is doing low HR intervals.  People can get to the point that HR is low and power is approaching upper tempo. So it feels hard but your heart is not working so hard so ultimately more sustainable.

You should try one thing at a time. You already saw the value of that point.</p>\n<p>There is one other point I would like to adress. Doing one single work-out for weeks on end is not a good thing. You always want to mix things up. For your body, as wel as for your own interest.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m specifially talking about he 4x8 intervals. I would start with 4x2 and work your way up to 4x8. Research shows that shorter intervals are way more effective, because the time you need to focus is shorter.</p>\n<p>Also, from a overload point of view a progressive series of work-outs makes more sense than doing the same work-out over and over again. Research shows that doing the same work-out over and over will make you progress in the first three weeks, than stop and eventually even lose some fitness.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I always create three week cycles and build cycle by cycle towards a greater fitness and more race specific intevals.</p>\n<p>Have lots of fun, Coach Robert</p>",

You mention agreeing with Alex completely, but seem to be recommending the intervals, though with a progression rather than repeating the same sets. However, during base season Alex had suggested doing pure Maffetone, which would keep me in Zone 2 every ride and preclude any intervals for at least a while, if not fully until my build phase. Are you suggesting I should start those now but in smaller doses in the beginning with 4x2 progressing towards 4x8 by the time I get to the build, or sticking with the Maffetone now but applying that progression to the build phase?</p>\n<p>Thanks again, learning a lot here!</p>",

I have never heard of any coach recommending this (Dr Seiler is not really a \u201creal\u201d coach, I believe he just likes this and it is simple and produces reasonable results).  It goes against training principals like progressive overload and variety for example.  But at the same time it can produce reasonable results if you don\u2019t mind suffering a lot.  There are physically easier and more efficient ways to do this, but that one is dead simple.</p>\n<p>Dr Seiler is a scientist that proved something very valuable.

So you might start at 100/0 and end at 80/20 or even more hard work (time in zone)\u2026 but still over the year you will be very polarized.</p>\n<p>I would agree with Robert that even during a build period you should do more variety.  I believe the Coach Jack serious Italian gives the widest variety for a build period but different people can benefit more from different types of variety.  Generally 3 focused workouts that are progressive including 1 long ride a week is a very traditional and very good plan.  Your time in zone will still be pretty Polarized even though you are doing 3 focused workouts a week.</p>",
