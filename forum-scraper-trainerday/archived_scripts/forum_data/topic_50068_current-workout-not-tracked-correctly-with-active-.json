      "cooked": "<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>I am still experiencing the issue that the current workout (or perhaps better said, the last workout) is not tracked correctly if I use the active plan feature (i.e. not using a strict calendar for workouts). Also see my <a href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/t/general-discussions/44/73\">earlier post</a> about this.</p>\n<p>Activated a plan to use on mobile phone. The plan is synced/active in the app. The first few unique workouts are tracked correctly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the today tab \u2018from plan\u2019 workout shows to correct current workout to do</li>\n<li>the workout tab \u2018Plan\u2019 overview highlights the correct current workout to do</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, the multi week plan might contain the same workout in a later week. E.g.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Planned day 1 workout \u201c60 mins of pain\u201d</li>\n<li>Days 2 - 8</li>\n<li>Planned day 9 workout \u201c60 mins of pain\u201d (again\u2026)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What happens, after completing the day 9 workout, is that the app thinks I just did the day 1 workout, and</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the today tab \u2018from plan\u2019 workout shows the day 2 workout (as the next workout to do)</li>\n<li>the workout tab \u2018Plan\u2019 overview highlights day 2 as current workout to do</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And yes upon saving the workout I do have the checkbox mark workout as completed ticked.</p>\n<p>This makes it a bit of an annoying hassle to manually find (check activities to find the last workout from the plan you did) and start (scroll through the workouts tab to go to the correct workout day) the correct workout.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the workout tracking for an active plan can be fixed in an upcoming version.</p>\n<p>I noticed that starting a workout from the workout tab \u2018Plan\u2019 overview stores the activity as \u2018Day xxx - workout name\u2019. Starting the \u201cfrom plan\u201d workout form the today tab stores the activity as \u2018workout name\u2019, without the day number indication. Perhaps the fix is twofold, always store the activity with the day indication in the name, regardless the tab (today vs workout) it was started from. And improve the \u2018last completed workout from plan\u2019 lookup code by also using the day indication stored as part of the activity. Side note, the activities can also include non-plan workouts intermingled with plan workouts. Perhaps not the best focussed training regime, but if I do f.e. a nice outdoor ride/event, I do an easy workout, not from my active plan, the day before and/or an easy recovery workout, also not from the active plan, the day after the event, before picking up the next workout from my active plan.</p>\n<p>Phone: Android<br>\nApp Version 5.1.0</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nSverre</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Very good reproduction steps and information.  Yes, I think we look at the workout ID and if you use the same workout twice in the plan it would get confused.  Did not consider this case is my belief.  We will try to get this fixed ASAP.  We just launched new billing and he is super busy fixing a few issues there but as soon as that is done I will have him improve this.  We need to pass Plan Day # instead of workout ID.</p>",
