Would be great to maybe highlight the full box in a different color (eg. red) so that the user notices easily</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks!<br>\nPaulo</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi Paulo, welcome.  We have not had anyone request the out of target indicator, I guess most are using ERG but I would guess 10-20% are not.  Yes if you came from TR, one beep is much more subtle. I was the opposite that the TR beeps bothered me so that is why we made ours much less.  People requested \u201cmore intensity for beeps\u201d either louder or something in the past.  That is why we created the flash but if you are watching something else you won\u2019t see our flash.</p>\n<p>We are working on a slight cleaned up design so I will consider both of these and see if I have an opportunity to do something\u2026</p>",
