      "cooked": "<p>Hi, I\u2019ve just begun cycling this summer, and am now transitioning to indoor training. I basically created a base plan with coach jack, with the intent to do mostly zone 2 training this winter. My first ride was today, and I think I am misunderstanding when to use the heart rate - based training vs keeping it in erg mode. I watched your video on hr+, and have a good idea of where my z2 limit is (max hr of 183, 39year old male) - in the mid 120s or so. But when I started today\u2019s exercise, I had to manually switch to hr mode, and the values were at 92bpm for each \u201cinterval\u201d of the \u201clolygag 40 +cad\u201d workout. Do I need to go into each workout and actually set the target heart rates, or should I keep it in erg mode?</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi and welcome,</p>\n<p>The Coach Jack plans don\u2019t utilize this HR+ mode yet.  I am a hard core believer in Maffetone and \u201cTrue Zone 2\u201d in general.  Which that means spending a period of the year doing a true base.  This means either you do only zone 2, or you monitor your progress of HR to power in these workouts and watch for progress, once you see progress you can start adding 1 workout a week of non-zone 2 and see if you still see progress for example.</p>\n<p>Most people are not such strong believers in this low heart rate training so Coach Jack just offers Zone 2 power based workouts.  For some people either would be fine and for others they can see definite benefits in HR based training.  So it\u2019s a personal decision for you.  You can follow the regular Coach Jack workouts but on the days that say endurance or zone 2, just press the HR+ at the beginning of the workout and set your target HR and forget about it. <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">   You will see the power targets but they will be ignored.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi, nice that you started cycling.</p>\n<p>Alex made some good points. He knows everything about the options within the program.<br>\nLet me provide you with a bit more background in the training part.</p>\n<p>Power is absolute. It is always accurate and actual. The second you push the pedal down, that force is meassured and shown on your display. That is why most cyclist think this is the most important thing.</p>\n<p>But power means nothing if you don\u2019t know how to interprete it. There are many zones, but we can simplify things by using our two thresholds.</p>\n<p>There is an aerobic threshold and an anaerobic threshold. Under aerobic threshold is where you will build endurance. Theoretically you an use this speed forever. The fatigue is very litlle.<br>\nAbove anaerobic threshold is where you ride the fastest, but you will burn out in an hour or even minutes.</p>\n<p>It is important to train both of these systems. You will need to do a lot of \u201czone 2\u201d under aerobic threshold and only a small amount of \u201czone 4,5,6\u201d above anaerobic threshold.</p>\n<p>The problem is, that these zones shift. As you have probably noticed the models provide you with a very consistent patern in zones. 55-66, 65-75, etc.<br>\nIn reality it is not like that. These zones are very personal, depending on your training and muslce type.</p>\n<p>What you need to do is a test. You can do a FTP test to establish your threshold. If you choose the 20 minute test you will have your ftp power and the corresponding heart rate. It is not an easy test, but the more you will do this, the more reliable your result will be.</p>\n<p>You will need to do an aerobic threshold test too. This is done using your breath. Slowly increase the power untill you can\u2019t speak full sentences anymore. Check you corresponding heart rate (and power).</p>\n<p>As your training progresses, so will the thresholds. For beginners they will change in weeks or months, for elite cyclists it will take a months or even a whole season.</p>\n<p>Try to use slope mode too. It is important that you connect power, heart rate, breath and cadence and what that feels like so you can learn how to play with them.</p>\n<p>Like Alex said: start with that zone 2 and slowly add some above threshold work, when you\u2019re ready.</p>\n<p>Make sure your training room is not to hot. That will raise your heart rate and will misplace your threshold.</p>\n<p>Have lots of fun, Coach Robert</p>",

After getting through the Fall with a family trip and some illness ripping through all of us, I finally got my trainer and signed up for a Coach Jack Plan.  I am doing a lengthy base period.  I actually love Zone 2.  I find it rather meditative.</p>\n<p>The weird thing I\u2019m finding is that while I\u2019m in Zone 2 power, at times I\u2019m actually in Zone 3 and sometimes even Zone 4 HR.  I suspect this has something to do with the roughly 40 extra lbs I\u2019m carrying and having to push blood through this worthless tissue.  <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">  I can still carry on a conversation at these HR\u2019s so for me personally I wonder if Maffetone HR isn\u2019t quite accurate.  Afterall, I have seen a HRMax of 189 on a hard uphill VO2 interval I did months back.  At 49 years old I think that\u2019s a huge outlier.</p>\n<p>What I\u2019ve done is stick with the power numbers and ERG mode on the trainer and just keep an eye on the HR.  As I\u2019m progressing, I\u2019m starting to see the HR come down for the same level of effort.</p>",

I don\u2019t think the weight has such a big impact on this disconnect Z2/Z4, it\u2019s more a factor of aerobic conditioning.  Also people are different.  I knew an older guy here that was high Z3 power and low Z2 HR (opposite of you), so he could ride sweet spot for 4+ hours.  But generally training will bring this closer together. I could explain more but you get the point.</p>\n<p>I think most of us want to think we are outliers\u2026 At 48 my max HR was 186 but I was still training strictly below 132 (.5% of my time was above).  I would follow Maffetone\u2019s protocol exactly.  Which is error on the low side\u2026 Meaning for you</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Strictly under 131/132 (Maffetone says even -10 should produce good results so that is 121-ish\u2026)</li>\n<li>Do a maf test each week</li>\n<li>Once you see consistent progress 3 weeks in a row on maf test you can try increasing by 5bpm and see if you continue to increase. You can try it 3 more times, if you want to increase 5 more go ahead.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As long as you are doing your rides fasted / no pre ride carbs\u2026 and seeing aerobic progress you are fine.  As you see progress your power will be increasing for your HR target and eventually high Z2 HR should be more like low Z3 power and that makes you more average/reasonable.  If you stop seeing progress start over with Maffetone\u2019s 180 suggestion and see if you can restart your progress.</p>\n<p>This is the most \u201cright\u201d way to do it but if you are just starting their is a reasonable chance that anything will produce aerobic progress.  I would say that fun that drives consistency should be just as much a priority or more so than perfect Maffetone unless doing too much causes injury or illness.</p>",

I had never trained with power before as it wasn\u2019t really a thing 25 years ago.  Even back then, HR was something I kept an eye on but was always going more on RPE.</p>\n<p>After the first month of Base I decided out of curiosity to do another Ramp after the rest week and start of the next Base month.  It had gone up but rather than setting a new FTP that high, I split the distance and only increased it a little bit.  The second month of training felt pretty easy, which I think it should\u2019ve since it\u2019s all Zone 2.  However by the end of the cycle, while I was able to complete the workouts, fatigue was definitely setting in.  The positive is that my Zone 2 power rides were now almost entirely in Z2 for HR as well, save for the last hour of a nearly 4 hour ride I started to experience HR drift.</p>\n<p>Going forward I do plan to incorporate a 4DP type of test where I test the 5 minute power, 20 minute power and 1 minute power all in one workout.  Now that I\"ve got a few consistent months under me and have a ballpark as to where power should roughly be for those efforts, I have a bit more confidence in tackling something like that.</p>\n<p>I do have a bit of a health oddity that I can\u2019t seem to solve that I\"m going to search the rest of the forum for before posting anything on it.  I believe this likely has something to do with the mismatches in HR and Power Zones but we\u2019ll see.</p>",
