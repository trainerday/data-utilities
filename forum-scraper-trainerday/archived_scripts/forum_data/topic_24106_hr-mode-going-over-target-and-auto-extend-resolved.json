So I set my target at 140 and everything seemed happy (although i don\u2019t really get the auto extend, I get getting told workout had finished, can I set a different time on a quick workout?) but then the Netflix got intersting / exciting and when I looked at the app HR had climbed to 154, which wasn\u2019t really what I expected. I thought the power would have backed off way before then. What am I doing wrong? I did have a search about first and couldn\u2019t figure it out so I am guessing it\u2019s something super basic I got wrong.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Generally we currently allow +2% of HR before going down again.  Next version we have changed it to 0%. Please share a link to your workout.  It\u2019s aways possible it could be holding to about 143 and then if you do a quick change like letting go of the bars that can shoot your HR up and it will take our system 30-60 seconds to get it back down.   If it sustained at 154 that sounds more like a problem of some sort.  So generally I would say for now set it to 135 if you want a 140 max, as it is more like 140 average now.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t understand your question exactly but if you turn on auto extend in the settings it will just keep extending the workout forever.  So just pedal and stop when you are done.</p>",
