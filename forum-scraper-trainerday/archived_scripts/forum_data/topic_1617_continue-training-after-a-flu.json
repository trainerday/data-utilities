      "cooked": "<p>Sorry to hear.  I am on vacation so I can\u2019t give any lengthy answer.</p>\n<p>I belive most flu\u2019s happen when we have lowered immunity. How were you feeling prior to the flu?  What was your TSB?  Were you feeling over trainined at all, meaning even though Jack plans are not super hard if you have a lot of stress or not getting good sleep it still might contribute.  Understanding if stress was a contributer to getting ill partially changes the answer.</p>\n<p>Generally I would say ease back into it with some easy riding for a week or two, but it depends on total number of days off the bike, and to some degree your physilogical age.  I tend to like to wait until it is really gone but I am 55 so take things cautiously these days.  Also depending on how hard the workouts were feeling when you got sick would depend on how far you back up your schedule. I have discussed this before with Coach Andrea, and generally I think after a couple weeks no riding and one week of taking it easy you could back up your schedule to the previous recovery week before 2-3 weeks ago and start there.  But if you only took one week 100% off the bike then that can change it a little.  Once I understand your answers I can try confirming with Coach Andrea too.</p>",

Yes we get sick from kids too but I still believe in many cases if we are well rested our body can fight it. But adjustments to training every time kids get sick is difficult. Congrats on PR and performance.</p>\n<p>So in your case if you recover quickly, you should not lose much if any fitness. Do your peak period as planned but just shorten and adjust your build period a little. It\u2019s hard to say exactly how without seeing your weekly tss targets starting 3-weeks before you got sick and ending 4 weeks from now.</p>",

I don\u2019t take these numbers too seriously, but just look at the basic perspective.  Super deep negative TSB for too long and feeling symptoms of this (risk of illness) vs closer to zero vs losing fitness and performing well at approximately zero to positive.</p>",
