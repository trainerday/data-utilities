      "cooked": "<p>I totally bought in zone 2 training since the end of the summer season. While it\u2019s counter intuitive in the beginning, it\u2019s doing miracles if you stick to it. The biggest challenge for me was to do it outside. I live in a very hilly region. But I nailed it in the end. One thing I started to think is actually hinted at in one of the blogpost of Alex : what\u2019s the point of doing a ramp test to get your FTP? The ramp test seems to me more a function of your anaerobic capacity. So I\u2019m puzzled there. I did something different which works great at the moment. Probably not very scientific, but it works.  After doing zone 2 for some time, my heartrate at the same power levels dropped significantly. I know, heartrate varies, not very reliable,\u2026 However, I noticed over a couple of days of zone 2 session a drop of at least 10%. So without doing another FTP test, I added 10% to my previous FTP. And bang on, my heartrate went up to the \u2018target\u2019 part of my estimated zone 2 again. And while cycling outside, I notice the new FTP is rather accurate.  Any thoughts ?</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>So happy to read this!<br>\nFTP itself is aerobic but the ramp test goes up into the anaerobic zone. The ramp test does a good job at estimating your FTP, and an FTP within the ballpark is important to correctly calculate load. But for the rest, it is rather useless in my opinion. Unless you like \u2018bragging\u2019 numbers <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\"><br>\nFor Z2 training, HR is the best way to go. If you do it purely by power, you will neglect the fact that all days are different. Sometimes your body is better or worse at accepting the load you put it through.<br>\nWhat you see with the dropping HR is that you are becoming more efficient. Efficiency factor (Watts/BPM) is a metric widely used in training analysis.<br>\nNow, let\u2019s be realistic, the gains you are seeing now, will not continue. It will gradually become slower and slower, because now you are at a point where your fitness is rapidly evolving. But the better you get, the slower/smaller the gains become. You see, I\u2019m not saying that you shouldn\u2019t use Power, you should use it in a different way depending on the type of work you\u2019re doing.<br>\nAt that point, it is a good idea to add in some sparse higher intensity work. The aerobic work you\u2019re doing now, is the best way for beginners to rapidly gain fitness. Look at it as \u2018raising the floor\u2019. But once the floor comes close to the ceiling, you will need to raise the ceiling. Just to make more room for the floor to raise even higher.<br>\nIt is so difficult to get the message through to beginners, that the way to go is \u2018easy\u2019. Stories like yours, may convince a couple more people that it does work a lot better then the \u2018No Pain, No Gain\u2019 philosophy.<br>\nYou gain basic fitness fast and have close to no risk of getting injured or overtrained. But you need to have a bit of patience for your body to react. This work makes up the base of a pyramid, a base that will be so strong that you can build high peaks on it later on.<br>\nSo continue to have fun and \u2018Smell the roses\u2019!</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Agree with all of the points made.  2 additional remarks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>HR is indeed variable, can be different from day to day.  With Trainerday, the +/- is what it takes to tune it.  It\u2019s HR before Power.  I had a conversation on it with the GCN guys and they actually asked the question on one of the videos of Dr. Inego San Milan.  HR is closer to representing what it\u2019s all about : what energy system you are using.  And that\u2019s what you need to train, not the power as such.  I\u2019m currently looking into non invasive lactate measuring devices.  Unfortunately one of them was too early on the market and the company from Texas is no longer around. There\u2019s another one I\u2019m looking into, but it\u2019s quite expensive.  Don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s not used more often.  But that\u2019s another story in itself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When doing Zone2 work outside, you need to look at a combination of power and heartrate.  For the simple reason that heartrate is dragging.  Especially on climbs, look at your power of which you know it\u2019s your zone2 ceiling.  Don\u2019t go over it (which means : switch back to real low gearing and have the willpower to drive so slow uphill).  The heartrate will catchup and you stay in the zone.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I did since end of september is zone2 all week indoors.  Saturday going out for a ride without looking at numbers.  Like somebody on a diet with one day of \u201cno diet\u201d.  On Sunday I do a zone2 ride outside.  Since this week I started to do one HIIT session indoors in the middle of the week.  Taking the advice of somebody else on this forum : first a good portion of Zone2, the HIIT at the end, and not the other way round.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all big fun to work with, and the results are stunning <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",

      "cooked": "<p>First things first : it seems like you don\u2019t have a proper ventilator for an indoor training.  Get that first.  There\u2019s a great GCN video where one of the presenters did exactly the same workout with or without ventilator.  The difference was 10 bpm if I recall.  Which is normal, you are overheating.  Even if the room temperature is low (like close to freezing), you still need a ventilator. Reason : when you are outside, you are moving and the air is cooling you.  Not so indoors.   So if the room was let\u2019s say 10\u00b0 and now it\u2019s 20\u00b0 \u00a9, don\u2019t look any further, has nothing to do with your aerobic adaptation.<br>\nSecondly : heartrate is an indicator, but it\u2019s not perfect.  It\u2019s \u201cthe best available\u201d, if you take lactate testing out of the possibilities.  Zone 2 is really about what energy system you are using.  Which is only be accurately defined by lactate measurements (and to be honest, even then some specialists have different opinions on what zone 2 exactly is).  Heartrate is the next best thing, but it\u2019s not perfect.  It can be impacted by variables like : overheating (like you experienced), but also getting a cold or a flue.</p>\n<p>So in summary : get the cooling fixed and keep in mind it\u2019s an indicator, not a hard metric KPI.</p>",
