      "cooked": "<p>You are right on!!! I was thinking the same thought\u2026  Meaning it\u2019s still a bit dynamic but you just switch the focus to the purpose of the plan (block) and you only specify hours per week and days per week.  We could pre-generate lots of combinations using CJ\u2026</p>\n<p>But also taking that one step farther which is more specialty plans, meaning start with the marketing side of the plan.   A nice description, specific need focus, some graphics or image to feel special about the plan like it is something special.  A bit of differentiation to really focus on a specific need.  TR makes workouts feel special by giving them a good name\u2026</p>\n<p>Many people want an \u201cFTP Builder.\u201d  So you search for FTP builder and you can get our plan.</p>\n<p>In most cases in a traditional periodization this should come after base and build but if someone wants to focus on that now they can.  Then also these specialty plans could be added as the peak part of coach jack as well.</p>\n<p>If you have more ideas please share.  I fully agree with your thinking here.  I think we also want to push the boundaries a bit more than we are normally comfortable recommending and give people stuff that\u2019s harder by default.  A bit more like a Zwift or TR plan.</p>\n<p>So maybe you start with FTP builder in search and it says \u201chey want to add some fries to that burger\u2026\u201d meaning how about \"Would you like to add base/build before that specialty plan?   <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",
