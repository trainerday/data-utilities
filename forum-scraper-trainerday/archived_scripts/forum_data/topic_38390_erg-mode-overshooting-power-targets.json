      "cooked": "<p>Our power match is not optimum for short duration higher intensity changes.  TrainerRoad had the same problem for about 8 years until they improved theirs. It\u2019s complicated to do.  The simple solution would be for us to just provide an offset (in addition to) rather than a new power match.  This would likely mostly fix the problem.  I would not be perfect but it would be better for bigger interval changes like these.  Sorry I have no better suggestion at this point.  You could turn off power match and press + or -.  This is basically what offset would do but the problem is without an offset feature your power would always be at a different level than the target or the graph, so it looks worse.</p>",

Using Speedplay\u2019s dual sided power meters and a KICKR ROLLR, the interval from 100W to 316W was overshooting by as much as 30% (410W or so) in the 3s power reading and would reach goal watts after about 10 seconds. The 100W to 270W was overshooting by 15% (324W or so) and would settle after about 10 seconds. That amount of overshoot adds a massive amount of extra stimulus.</p>\n<p>Is there any chance that I could send the workout to my Garmin Edge 840 (after upgrading to Premium) and have the workout use Garmin\u2019s ERG mode to force a tighter watt tolerance?</p>\n<p>That or\u2026 can the calculation be set to undershoot by 10% or so and then settle into the interval\u2019s watts?</p>",

I guess you know this, but ultimately it does not matter what you see on the screen from a training perspective, it just matters what hits your legs\u2026  But I realize getting accurate your data for analysis can be important.  As long as you are recording from your pedals (our app records single sided only) then the accuracy should be fine.</p>",
