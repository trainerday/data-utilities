I have been deep in research on this subject for the last year or so and feeling like I am starting to get a strong grasp of best practices.  Not that flexibile yet but have eliminated all the tight muscles and soft tissue issues.</p>\n<p>I want to start an education and discussion process around this.  During this thinking, and with a great lack of time a friend offered to write a blog post on ankle mobility.  His article is here</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.trainerday.com/off-season-tune-up-ankles-9e2377728dbc\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://blog.trainerday.com/off-season-tune-up-ankles-9e2377728dbc</a></p>\n<p>I will continue adding a lot more about mobility as well as getting advice and some of the science around how mobility affects and can potentially improve cycling.  Generally we know cycling is a very lopsided sport so we need some other activities to try to get a bit of balance.  Rowing on Concept 2 for example is a good one.  The right strength training might be the best one.  Anyway I will keep providing updates on this.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Yes very tight hamstrings was a problem for me too as well as tight calves.  Both of these leading to other problems, nothing serious but I always on the edge.  I finally feel confident (ok semi) I have a solution after experimenting for the last 10+ years.  Foam rolling my hamstrings and calves aleviated most of the problems but was seriously time consuming and had to be done almost daily to keep up.  Reducing periods of sitting also helped.  Lots of short breaks, standing/sitting desk\u2026   so that managed it but if I got lazy things would go south.  About a month ago I bought a theragun (I have read cheaper alternatives are just as good and much better value).  This thing is amazing.  5-minutes of theragun is considerably better than 30 minutes of foam rolling.</p>\n<p>As Alex pointed out in that article you then need to lock in your mobility improvements once you have them.  So softening my soft tissue issues, makes me more flexible or feeling like I am capable of being flexible.</p>\n<p>I have always hated stretching, partially because I am not good at being highly consistent and could never see obvious improvement.  I have been working on going deeper and deeper on squats and realize now my squat mobility has improved a lot.  So this is stretching with out practicing stretching.  I am working with a new 30-year Coach (Robert) on a new TrainerDay solution and he knows a lot about a lot.  He pointed me towards the superiority of resistance stretching which I realized is exactly what I am doing with these deep squats.  This is the first time I in my life I have ever seen clear, obvious and rapid mobility/flexibility improvements and so with theragun to fix the tight muscles in combination with resistance stretching I see the possibly of a very flexible future.  This resistance stretching is popularlized or even created by Bob Cooley.
