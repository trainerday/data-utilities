I would suggest you do a custom coach jack plan and use some of the block variants.  But there is no reason you can throw in some variety from our workout database.  With Coach Jack we focus more on the raw fundamentals of training rather than the entertainment value, and I realize that is not the most exciting.  In reality higher intensity is more exciting, at least it does not give you time to get bored.  So I guess this is the long answer to the fact that this is not as polished from an entertainment standpoint as those platforms are.</p>",

Very weird way of thinking and as a coach, never heard of it before. Actually, with power meters so popular, cadence drills are very neglected. The best performing cyclists are able to maintain high power AND high rpms. It is a FUNDAMENTAL training ability to work on and in development categories, it is absolutely necessary since gearing are limited. Also, able to use higher cadence means you solicit less muscular which brings less fatigue.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>No problem I like the discussion. You are absolutely right that top pro and elite cyclists tend to have a higher cadence than average.  Not universally true but on it\u2019s common in modern times.</p>\n<p>But\u2026 It has been shown that most people can sustain the most power for the longest period of time at their natural cadence.  And never been proven that riding at higher than your natural cadence will produce better results (and to some degree the opposite has been \u201cproven\u201d)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also shown that doing cadence drills tends to have a small impact on natural cadence unless done over a very long period of time.  That said, if you are at the top of your performance level trying to squeeze out that last 2-5% out of your performance than cadence drills for sure can make a difference.  So my entertainment statement is a bit of an exaggeration.</p>\n<p>But to my argument very few of us are at a level that this matters, so this is why I put cadence drills as entertainment or skills work not a critical performance enhancement.</p>\n<p>This is a good friend of mine and ex-pro cyclist and while his message is different than what I am suggesting if you read between the lines the message is similar.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-onebox lazy-video-container\" data-video-id=\"1yvcgm1Y7GY\" data-video-title=\"Getting this wrong will make you a better cyclist\" data-video-start-time=\"\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yvcgm1Y7GY\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"video-thumbnail\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <img class=\"youtube-thumbnail\" src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2bc18ac5fdf0a98186917c9a4ec6024650cdcbd6.jpeg\" title=\"Getting this wrong will make you a better cyclist\" data-dominant-color=\"5C5B4C\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\">\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n<p>The point I take from his message is that for amateur cyclists improving their cardiovascular system which is likely best done via Zone 2 training (the general belief these days) and from that you may be in a better position to pedal a bit faster and take benefit from a little higher cadence especially in long events.  So it\u2019s not that I am against cadence work for incremental improvement, it\u2019s just significantly more important to focus on training.  So much so that it\u2019s very optional for anyone not at their personal peak performance but if you enjoy it, have fun <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">   So I don\u2019t consider it a base level fundamental to performance but I do plan to add some cadence drills to Coach Jack in the future.  For both entertainment and potenital incremental gains.</p>\n<p>FYI - The woman that recently won the world record for 1 hour did it at something around 65 rpm.</p>",

(extreme example)</p>\n<p>I would argue that for any individual if they do the right workouts, recovery and volume management, they will be significantly better off that if that same individual neglects one of those 3 and instead does lots of cadence work.  Meaning it has a much smaller impact.  I am not saying that it has no impact.  Most people don\u2019t get those top 3 correct (pro cyclists do them right as much as possible within their crazy schedules).</p>\n<p>Again I am not arguing if it is valuable or not, more just that it is not a key fundamental to training and naturally most people are going to have some level of cadence variance in different types of training.  So just randomly throwing in a bit of sustained cadence variance on your own would give most of us, \u201c80%\u201d of the benefit of specific cadence drills.</p>",
