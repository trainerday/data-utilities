It  may be a problem with the Pixel 6a because both Telsa and Rivian had problems with this phone too initially until they did some updates to their apps (so something unique about the 6a).</p>\n<p>Phone: Pixel 6a<br>\nDevices: Garmin cadence sensor, Wahoo Kicker Snap Trainer, Various bluetooth HRMs (Garmin Dual, Morpheus, and Polar H10).</p>\n<p>I have no other devices/connections.  Trainer day consistently detects the bluetooth devices no problem, but I would say connects to them only 10% of the time.  It usually takes me 5-10 minutes of turning bluethooth on/off airplane mode on/off, and restarting the phone and app.   Usually I can get one device to connect (which of the three seems random) but then the second and third seem more and more unlikely to connect so getting all three is difficult.</p>\n<p>I have also made sure these are not bound in bluetooth settings, I also read the forum and tried suggestions like removing them from TD and then adding one by one and letting them connect first, but nothing really works.  Once connected, usually they stay connected but today during a VO2 max session I lost both the HRM permanently and it took about 5 minutes to get the Kicker Snap to connect back to TD (but hey, it at least dropped 10 seconds before 120% FTP interval <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve also made sure there is no wifi interference, and these same devices do work both Ant and Bluetooth to my Forerunner 965 and Edge 1030P [ I have made sure both are these are off and not connecting, as well as all other apps stopped on the phone ].</p>\n<p>I really like the Live PC view and the target HR features of the app, so would prefer using it over garmin.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m hoping others may have seen something similar or have suggestions I\u2019ve not yet tried (I haven\u2019t tried using an ANT+ USB to phone device yet, but that was my next thought).</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/alex\">@Alex</a>, I may have found a way you could try and reproduce reliably on your Pixel 6 when all devices are connected (without turning off/on bluetooth).</p>\n<p>I was doing a workout today and got an incoming text, and I swapped over for about 10 seconds to read it, then back.  When I came back to TD only one of the three devices (re)connected (the one device may have not had to reconnect as I just noticed that there was only 1 device connected in the status indicator.)</p>\n<p>I would expect that maybe they would disconnect when TD is in the background, but I would have also expected them to all reconnect relatively quickly as well.  The devices (and only devices connected) where a Kickr Snap Trainer, Polar H10 HRM, and a Garmin cadence sensor.  Also, it appears there is no problem when there is only a single bluetooth device, it seems to get progressively worse when adding a 2nd and 3rd device.</p>\n<p>I made sure that the TD app had unrestricted / unlimited battery and data usage (including background data), so it should not have stopped running, and also, the workout continued when I returned so the app was at least not killed/restarted.</p>\n<p>If that doesn\u2019t reproduce the problem on the Pixel 6 then it must be something unique to my setup or the 6a.</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking a look.</p>",

It\u2019s the <strong>Rivian App</strong> or Rivian/Android Phone Key.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know the difference between Tesla and Rivian, but Rivian binds to a \u201cRivian Phone Key\u201d bluetooth device, I don\u2019t know if this is the same thing as \u201cAndroid Phone Key\u201d, but during the Rivian setup phone-as-a-key it does ask to allow the Rivian App to \u201chave access\u201d to the \u201cRivian Phone Key\u201d.   Tesla is not the same as they for sure don\u2019t use the \u201cAndroid Phone Key\u201d system nor do they bind to a bluetooth device in the system\u2019s bluetooth list. i.e. Android\u2019s \u201cbluetooth\u201d devices don\u2019t have an entry for Tesla\u2019s PaaK, but they do for Rivian Phone Key.</p>\n<p>The strange thing is that even after force stopping, clearing Rivian app cache/storage, removing the PaaK in the bluetooth device list, and uninstalling Rivian app TD problem still exists \u2026 until I reboot the phone, then everything works as expected.</p>\n<p>Installing the Rivian app and signing into your Rivian account also does not cause any problems [ so you can\u2019t try and reproduce unless you have access to a Rivian to connect to ].  But as soon as you setup the Rivian app as a phone key, boom, problems connecting with other devices (until you uninstall Rivian app and reboot).</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure where to go from here.  I could contact Rivian, but they likely would not be able to reproduce it.  Also, since the problem requires a reboot after uninstalling Rivian it\u2019s probably a bug in android\u2019s bluetooth stack.</p>\n<p>Would be great if there were other Rivian users that could chime in (or other car manufacturers that use an \u201candroid phone key\u201d bluetooth connection - i.e. not Tesla).</p>",
