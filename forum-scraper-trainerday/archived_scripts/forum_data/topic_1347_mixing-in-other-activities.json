Staying healthy helps you stay consistent.</p>\n<p>Some combinations<br>\n2-days a week of strength and 3-4 days a week of aerobic/endurance training (cycling or other) is usually about right for maximum fitness but it depends on your health, age and ability to recover.

      "cooked": "<p>Alex - thank you so much for the quick response!</p>\n<p>More info:  I\u2019m 63 and have been very active for most of my adult life (up until about 3 years ago). Most of that time, my primary activities were martial arts (both kung fu - fast - aerobic and anerobic- and tai chi (slow, zone 1&amp;2), as well as biking. Biking has been recreational weekend rides and some commuting.  Running has always been strictly for a quick intense workout - not particularly fun for me.  And rowing is recent, but trying to incorporate more of it.<br>\nFor a variety of reasons, I had a 3 year period of very little exercise, but about 2 months ago, I got back on the wagon, and have been doing a lot of biking and rowing (indoor - I live in Boston).<br>\nI don\u2019t compete in anything currently- my goals are general fitness and getting back my skills in martial arts. I\u2019ve competed in martial arts in the past - perhaps I will again - but it\u2019s a very low priority.<br>\nSo I\u2019d like to create a training plan that helps me take a balanced approach without getting too rigid.<br>\nI don\u2019t think I need a periodized approach since I\u2019m looking for a continuous, long-term approach.  On the other hand, I\u2019d like to get back to longer recreational bike rides when the weather is warmer, which I haven\u2019t done in a long time.  Longest recent indoor rides have been about 15 miles at about 13mph average.  I might like to get a bit faster so I can keep up with friends - but again, racing of any kind is not of interest.<br>\nI was hoping for some suggestions on how to balance types of workouts (endurance, tempo, threshold, etc) with particular activities.  For instance, would a particular type of workout be better suited to a particular activity type or vice versa.  Since I know running will get my heart rate up fast, that might be good for VO2 max training in particular.  There are lots of training plans out there, but almost all of them are focused on competing in a particular event type.   I\u2019m not sure that there really are particular best practices for my goals - but I\u2019m open to opinions.</p>\n<p>Thanks for any input.</p>\n<p>Michael</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Sorry this dropped lower on the list.  So starting again 2-months ago means you are probably starting to feel very good.  This time when you start feeling good, there is a sense of invincibility.  This is the most dangerous time in training <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> This is when we start doing more, wear ourselves down and opening ourself up to injury and sickness.  I would keep biking as recreational and try to keep the pushing yourself (anerboic) for shorter durations on the bike and your Kungfu.  So if you are also doing indoor cycling I would do Z1/Z2 for these periods.</p>\n<p>Using something like a Whoop strap to monitor your recovery might be a good idea but it seems it would be difficult to create a great training plan.  I would love to sell you on a CJ plan but I would only do base in CJ at least until you get to the 6-month or possibly 1-year mark.   Then your body will have stablized to your \u201cnew\u201d life and if you want to get more serious about performance cycling that would be the time.</p>\n<p>Regaring periodization, I would just do everything you can to take a rest week every 3 or 4 weeks, and cut your hours in 1/2 for that week and try to reduce intensity a bit.  Multisport atheltes are complicated.  You can also use something like TrainingPeaks or IntervalsICU to monitor your TSB (training stress balance).  Multi-sport atheltes are more complicated but really a whoop is likely the easist solution + some rest.  Also if you maintain consistency for longer periods of time of 6+ hours a week I you might need a seasonal recovery or cross training period.</p>\n<p>If you want cheaper options that a whoop, you could track your sleep and your HRV.  Pay very close attention to how you feel but feeling amazing is slighly misleading.</p>\n<p>I hope that helps.</p>",
