      "cooked": "<p>Hello Everyone,</p>\n<p>Just registered today.</p>\n<p>A little bit about me.  I have been doing triathlon since 2011.  To date, I\u2019ve completed 13 half ironmans and 7 Full Ironmans triathlons.  I just got back into training in May of this year after 4yrs hiatus due to a career change.  In the past, I\u2019ve used training plans and trainer road to help me build up my training.</p>\n<p>I have a very ambitious goal for next year.  My best half ironman is 5:03 (2017) and I would like to go below 5hours for half Ironman eagleman on June 9th.</p>\n<p>Ive played around with Coach Jacks plan and his suggestion came up with 6hours a week bike and peak at 17:30 for the bike alone.</p>\n<p>Im looking to get better in the bike and be able to hold a better average power.  I currently have a 235w FTP and would like to be able to bring that up and sustain a 80% power of the FTP.</p>\n<p>My questions is where do I begin that aligns with my goal above?<br>\nIve looked at the training plans and there seemed to be a lot of options I just dont know where to start.</p>\n<p>Thank you and looking forward to your answer</p>",
