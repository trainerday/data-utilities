At the end of the 8 weeks I will be level 12 at which point I will go back to a 4 week base plan.</p>\n<p>After the 4 week base plan I intend to return to another build block where it would be really useful if I could select a starting level above 10. I think in this instance 9 or 10 would be appropriate as I will lose some of the adaptions but just thinking about further down the line.</p>\n<p>Has it been considered increasing the options available at the start? Is it possible to back date your plan starting date as if that was the case I could select extra duration which would mean my starting point could be above 10?</p>\n<p>One further point is that when I search for workouts in my plan it returns no result. For example \u201cThreshold Block <span class=\"hashtag\">#11</span>\u201d returns no matching workouts. It would be useful to have these workouts available outside of a plan.</p>\n<p>Love the flexibility in building plans, the above points would make it easier when considering longer term progressions.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>",

We feel the value of workouts beyond the intensity of our <span class=\"hashtag\">#26</span> are of limited value and get too hard.  Yes some people could do that but that does not mean they should.  I realize that is a personal choice and for a minority there might be a value.  But to solve your problem if someone chose an 8 week block, we could allow going up to level 18 to start with which still takes you to 26.  I like this idea\u2026 Well I personally think it\u2019s too hard <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> but I like the solution\u2026  Pretty sure that should give you what you want and work from a system perspective.</p>\n<p>If my last explanation was not clear let me know and I can create a quick video or screenshots to show you what I mean.

I am less enthusiastic when it comes to endurance workouts on the turbo so maximum time I could handle is probably 1\u201930. Something I need to work on. But Base +++ and SFR looks interesting enough.</p>\n<p>My main event next year is the Marmotte so figured a plan based around lots of sustained efforts in the sweetspot, threshold, Vo2max on Tue / Thur with long endurance rides at the weekend would work best.

      "cooked": "<p>Actually your thoughts of going from <span class=\"hashtag\">#12</span> to <span class=\"hashtag\">#10</span> is even better.  Andrea says 4 weeks of NO activity should go from 12 to 9.  I was actually thinking 4 weeks of base could go back 1 week (I stated it wrong) but 2 weeks is even better/safer.</p>\n<p>Coach Chad says a lot of good stuff in my opinion and I am sure you learned some good stuff there.  As we know TR took Coggan\u2019s idea of trying to maixmize TSS with sweet spot.  After reading all the books and as a TrainingPeaks user/runner, I thought maximizing TSS made sense as well. Generally the inverse logic seems to hold true.  Most athletes will be there best when their CTL is the highest (and decent form/tsb)\u2026</p>\n<p>If youthink about this logic a little deeper, this means you could do all the \u201cwrong\u201d training for your body/personal needs but if your CTL is the highest you will be the fastest\u2026 hmm maybe not.  Probably injecting at least a small amount \u201cright\u201d training would have a large postive effect.  The bottom line is this is all theoretical science.  Once evidence based science (Dr Seiler) or many elite coaches started stepping up (Zone 2 propoents) we see that the TSS model does not hold up to evidence even when it does sound good in theory.</p>\n<p>Ultimately everyone wants to maximize their training but at the core of it lies \u201cit depends\u201d meaning in some cases the TR model works.  Especially for short term FTP gains, which from a marketing perspective is beautiful is because it\u2019s what everyone wants.  \u201cHow do I improve my FTP?\u201d</p>\n<p>As you see CJ is very different.  Many people love consitent hard work, look at the success of spin bike classes.  Nike\u2019s \u201cno pain, no gain.\u201d \u2026  Fitness marketing sells us this vision.  Zone 2, going on walks, come on that stuff is for the birds <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  Give me some real training\u2026</p>\n<p>Obviously there needs to be some hard work to get fast, it\u2019s just as Dr Seiler showed on as little as 6 hours a week it\u2019s still more like 90/10 for time in zone is more efficient in his studies than a much high contribution of his \u201czone 2\u201d which is zone3 or low zone 4 in the Coggan model.  Now some individuals might thrive on sweet spot, again \u201cit depends.\u201d But our belief is most will do better following a plan that starts easy (as low as intensity level <span class=\"hashtag\">#1</span>) and builds.  Most old school pros went and many still go from a pure zone 2 base to our level 1, just adding small amounts of intensity.  When at your base, your body just needs a small nudge to make gains.  It\u2019s like going to the gym and normally lifting 100 lbs and jumping to 250lbs\u2026 It\u2019s not going to be much benefit, sure you will gain something but you would do the same benefit and less pain and risk by going to 110lbs.  Small incremntal increases will nudge your body to make adjustments.</p>\n<p>I should point out there are some new school young kids (pros) doing well on some other stuff these days (max efforts in the winters) but they are taking a much higher risk based approach according to Andrea.  If they don\u2019t break it can work for them.</p>\n<p>I am talking a lot about pros but really Dr Seiler pointed out and Andrea feels the same the same principals hold true on as little as 6 hours a week as well.</p>\n<p>Anyway.  I say do what you love to do.  Enjoy yourself.  I am sure level <span class=\"hashtag\">#1</span> is way too crazy idea for you <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> If you love sweet spot, do it.  If you can do sweet spot all winter and feel strong in the late spring well than it\u2019s not so bad for you.  I realize even starting at our higher levels are still a big drop from many of the high TSS plans TR has.</p>\n<p>We always push for a health first approach to training.  Excess stress with minimal additional and possibly no or negative benefits is not worth it in our opinion.  More risk of illness, more risk of injury\u2026  I personally got a lot of insight out of this book \u201cFaster\u201d how how many pros (especially the author) focus more on health based approach to training.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox amazon\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Faster-Michael-Hutchinson-audiobook/dp/B01FGEEII4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">amazon.com</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:500/500;\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/e/edb485a16e785e9890a35d1fe3763bc699639e0b.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Faster-Michael-Hutchinson-audiobook/dp/B01FGEEII4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon.com: Faster: The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World's Fastest...</a></h3>\n\n<p>                   For professional cyclists, going faster and winning are, of course, closely related. Yet surprisingly, for many, a desire to go faster is much more important than a desire to win. Someone who wants to go faster will work at the details and take small steps rather than focusing on winning. Winning just happens when you do everything right - it's the doing everything right that's hard. And that's what fascinates and obsesses Michael Hutchinson. With his usual deadpan delivery and an awareness that it's all mildly preposterous, Hutchinson looks at the things that make you faster - training, nutrition, the right psychology - and explains how they work and how what we know about them changes all the time. He looks at the things that make you slower and why they do so and how attempts to avoid them can result in serious athletes gradually painting themselves into the most peculiar lifestyle corners. Faster is a book about why cyclists do what they do; about what the riders, their coaches, and the boffins get up to behind the scenes; and about why the whole idea of going faster is such an appealing, universal instinct for all of us.               </p>\n<p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  <strong>    $0.00   </strong>\n</p>\n\n  </article>\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>Andrea is health first all the way.

As your aerobic fitness improves significantly even the top of zone 2 heart rate is not so easy.  Dr Maffetone and the 7X iornman winner Mark Allen pointed out that when he got to peak fat / aerobic adaption he was doing zone 2 HR intervals as they were hard and he did not feel like keeping in zone 2 non-stop. Andrea points out for pros zone 2 is real work.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to clarify that Dr. Seiler\u2019s definition of easy is below AeT (aerobic threshold), determinine your AeT base on HR is the key point.  For a lot of people that is closer to 65% of power but might even be 60%.  That will improve over time as you get more and more aerobic / fat adapted.  If you eat pre-meal carbs that will shoot your HR up and start buring glycogen immediately so that you end up training at a lower power intensity.  If you can burn mostly fat then your HR stays lower, power goes up and it gets much harder.</p>",
