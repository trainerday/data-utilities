      "cooked": "<p>Hi, this is not an easy question to answer because it,is highly individual. Generally if your FTP is set correctly and you have been riding semi consistently then many people can ride a long time at tempo. Now many people prefer or enjoy intervals like 3x12 but they are not limited by intensity but by desire to do any more. So if you just want a plan you could just increase these by a minute or two each week and if it feels like you are pushing yourself you should take a light week every two or 3 weeks. Also if this very hart your FTP might be set wrong, for some people a ramp test can noticeably over estimate your FTP.</p>",
