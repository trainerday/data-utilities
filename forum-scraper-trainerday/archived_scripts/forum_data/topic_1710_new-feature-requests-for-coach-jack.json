      "cooked": "<p>That\u2019s interesting and I highly value your opinion.  Let me look at that.  With Jack\u2019s rules that might be complex.  I see your point. Meaning Jack always starts the plan on Monday, but essentially you are talking about starting your training week on Saturday or Sunday (in the way jack has rules) meaning in many riders cases Saturday and Sunday are a big days and if you want to ride Monday too then Monday should be a recovery ride.  Let me ask Coach Andrea too how he would handle this or has another way to make it simpler to make Jack\u2019s rules work but put the priority of the week over the priority of a Monday week start.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s good I should have asked if there were any other changes anyone wanted to CJ.  I will move this to a new thread request.</p>",
