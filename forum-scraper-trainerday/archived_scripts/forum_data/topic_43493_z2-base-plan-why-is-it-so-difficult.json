I find that while I do sit in the z2 heart rate zones, when doing the longer and \u201charder\u201d intervals (13 minutes sometimes!!!) that I am on the upper end of Z2 HR and maybe ~65-75% FTP.</p>\n<p>Is this\u2026 Normal? I find it very difficult to push through some of the intervals without taking a break and I am not even riding that long\u2026 60-75 minute rides.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi AntonTd,</p>\n<p>Nice work on all the structured training that you are planning for yourself. That is a good way to get better.</p>\n<p>You have to think about your body as two machines. You have the fat burning engine and the carb-burning engine. That fat burning engine  is the base. The carb-burning engine brings more speed and power to that base.</p>\n<p>These engines always work together. So, you are always burning a mixture of carbs and fat. The harder you go, the more carbs you will burn. These engines are, for a big part, determined by your genes. Some of us are pure sprinters (like Cavendish), some are pure climbers (like Vingegard), and some are a little bit of both (like Pogacar).</p>\n<p>With training, you can stimulate one or the other. If you are doing hard intervals all the time, you will lose your ability to do longer rides. And if you only do zone 2, you will lose your ability to ride fast.</p>\n<p>That is why a mixture of training is essential, and I guess that is part of your problem, too.</p>\n<p>While doing the sweet spot training, you\u2019ve missed a lot of zone 2 training. So you got good at doing sweet spot, but your aerobic threshold didn\u2019t progress along with this type of training.</p>\n<p>A lactate test would probably show it.</p>\n<p>My advice is to ignore your zone 2 power and use the zone HR to do these trainings.  Your power is not measured, it is estimated from your FTP.</p>\n<p>You could also do the zone test on Trainer Day. It is a good test to measure your aerobic threshold. If needed, adjust your aerobic threshold and continue doing the great work you have done so far.</p>\n<p>Have lots of fun, Coach Robert</p>",

This means that, for training power, there is no use in riding a different cadence than your natural preference.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean that you should train cadence. It means you should seperate getting faster from getting more efficient. My advice is to do some cadence drills during warm up and then forget about it.</p>\n<p>You can ride the test at erg and just talk every once in a while. Use a couple of senctences. Once you get to that point where the sentence is paused by a breath you are over the threshold.</p>\n<p>You could do this test outside too with a buddy. Slowly increase the speed to where you find that the conversation is not natural and your focus shifts from the conversation to keeping the pace.</p>\n<p>If your are time crunched I would recommend a Polarised program over a sweet spot program. Sweet spot takes more time to get better.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, let me know.</p>",
