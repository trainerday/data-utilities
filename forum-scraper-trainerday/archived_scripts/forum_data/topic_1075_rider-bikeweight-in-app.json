That said we have a build coming out soon that will slow it down slightly.  Since this is the second person suggesting it is too fast we might have to find add another setting to our web settings.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote quote-modified\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"1039\">\n  <div class=\"title\">\n    <div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/user_avatar/forums.trainerday.com/mjpuncheur/48/582_2.png\" class=\"avatar\">\n    <a href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/t/speed-distance-calculation-algorithm/1039\">Speed/distance calculation algorithm (Improvement)</a> \n  </div>\n  <blockquote>\n    Hi Alex, \nIt\u2019s also something I\u2019ve noticed with everyone\u2019s Zwift rides but indoor ride speeds, and subsequently ride distance, often appear inflated versus a realistic ride outdoors for a given power and elevation. \nEven a flat ride outdoors around a closed track with no stops would have wind resistance which would preclude the kind of numbers you see on smart trainers. \nHow does TrainerDay calculate these? \nIf I keep doing lots of indoor rides with our wet weather in Queensland at the moment, I\u2026\n  </blockquote>\n</aside>\n",
