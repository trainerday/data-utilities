If they are proportionally different then under \u2018normal\u2019 conditions, your body is trying to tell you something. The specific case you mention, is often misinterpreted by novice and even more experienced athletes. They see higher speed/effort/power with lower HR and interpret that as being in \u2018good form\u2019. While your body is trying to limit your intensity because it hasn\u2019t sufficiently recovered from the former activity. It\u2019s all a learning process with still a lot of \u2018unknowns\u2019\u2026<br>\nIt will not immediately get you in the danger zone of \u2018Overtraining\u2019, but you should prioritize recovery.</p>",

It\u2019s doing exactly the same thing as when you are sick. The body prioritizes its resources to heaI.  If you are highly motivated, you can force through but this is never a good idea. And that, in the longer term, can lead to overtraining.<br>\nIf you feel good, motivated and see HR responses that are similar to what you see in a recovered state, all is good. But a low HR is often seen as a good thing while it can be the opposite. It never hurts to be cautious.<br>\nHere\u2019s another quote:<br>\nThere is much more to loose by doing one hard session too much then by doing one too little. When in doubt, take it easy.</p>",

Time crunched will be fine to get in shape.  You could also post an image here of all your Coach Jack settings.  Ride feel for example you can take way up.

More like a real athletes threshold <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">   Yes zone differences confuse things as well.   But if you are about 150 of 167 threshold, that sounds more like most would consider a zone 3 level (above AeT).  Meaning moderate not easy.  Easy is probably staying under 140 but you would have to determine your own AeT to know for sure.</p>\n<p>Because Coach Jack starts out fairly easy this is not surprising and Coach Jack does not do sustained hard efforts unless you specifically change the settings.  I only see HR being ideal for easy or below AeT workouts or \u201cZone 2.\u201d</p>\n<p>If you want to increase the intensity, you can use a combination of</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Intensity slider</li>\n<li>Custom Block</li>\n<li>Ride Feel</li>\n</ol>",
