Again, probably because of those last two years, where, I believe, I lost a lot of endurance: by following the Italian plan, he helped me to get back some endurance. During the last month, the long Z2/Z3 rides became way easier than at the beginning of the Winter !</p>\n<p>So, I\u2019m planning to still work on the endurance, but I\u2019d like to give it a pinch a high intensity, to be able to tickle my previous PRs on local segments by the end of the Summer. Segments somewhere between\u2026 30s and 1h ! I guess that, by continuing the work on the endurance, I should start with the goal to improve my times on the longer segments, and progressively hit the shorter ones by slowly adding HIIT/VO2Max workouts ?</p>",

If you start pushing hard now in 2-more months you are at the end of your growth period and starting to get tired and less motivated.</p>\n<p>For outdoor northern hemisphere riders it is much harder to take it easy in the spring.  So you have to work around your own life and limitations.  If you know you cand do a hard period now, and then do a base period and start the cyclce over again in a few months.  Then go for it.  It is very unlikely you can push hard from now to the end of summer and still be motivated and in top form.</p>\n<p>I am not directly answering your question yet.

When I say \u201clonger\u201d, I\u2019m thinking about the time spent on the bike, not the distance: in 2020/21, I did most of my rides on the same flat road, because of the high intensity intervals that were impossible to do on hills (because of the downhills, not because of the climbs !). So this year, I will do more \u201cadventurous\u201d rides, to improve my general endurance, and hopefully after some time, I would be able to titillate some PRs if I progressively add some intensity. Well, that\u2019s the plan, now I will see later how things turn in reality\u2026</p>\n<p>PS: BTW, I will cancel my subscription for the outdoor seasons, but I will be back next Autumn/Winter !

That will give you short term benefits but will not aide in long term benefits and has the risk of causing you to peak too early.  Higher intensity increases the chance of injury and illness as well so could derail your season.</p>\n<p>I would focus on endurance work until you are about 4-8 weeks away from a key event (period) and then add intensity.  So just get out and ride your bike and have fun.  If you want to add in one day week of shorter duration higher intensity like HITT or something that should be a reasonable compromise.  If you prefer to peak in about 8-weeks from now, and then just try to hold on to what you have through the spring/summer that is a more typical race season but you are a bit ahead of schedule at the moment.</p>",

To answer your original question, a natural progression after the Italian is an 8-week peak plan of big climbs.  Or a custom plan that has a Dynamic Force workout which is a VO2max version of SFR.  So it will continue building on your SFR strength and give you some higher intensity like you want.  Keep doing your long rides like you have been doing.  Then the third workout is up for grabs.  Could be a HIIT but I would probably do threshold blocks if you want to keep with more variety during your week and have a natural plan extension to the Italian.</p>",

But I\u2019m also aiming at doing \u201cfreer\u201d rides this year, where I will go on the \u201cfeeling\u201d on segments, on climbs, \u2026 Not sure - well, don\u2019t know ! - how I could use TD in the middle of a ride.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Just checking.  You were asking about next CJ plan so I was not sure.  Outdoor takes real dedication to try to do quality intervals.  You can use it with a Garmin or Wahoo bike computer.  I am not in love with that experience but it is popular.  I personally suggest using the \u201ctop tube\u201d approach like many pros do, which is just write down your main intervals on paper or in message format and do your best to follow them.  So the plan is more on paper.  Hill repeats are good for say 10-30 minutes of your ride.  Really with CJ plans only the main work needs paying attention to not the secondary (just stay in approximate zone).</p>\n<p>So in your case after <span class=\"hashtag\">#18</span> threshold progression you could do <span class=\"hashtag\">#7</span> threshold blocks.  You are just trying to do 3 intervals at 4 minutes each of threshold.  This might be 3 hill repeats.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f0cbe7a2703412f1f7eaec8e1e30abe68246ba0a.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/f0cbe7a2703412f1f7eaec8e1e30abe68246ba0a\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f0cbe7a2703412f1f7eaec8e1e30abe68246ba0a_2_570x500.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"ymbskBUtu6PHr7ZhUkNhBcD6IAy\" width=\"570\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f0cbe7a2703412f1f7eaec8e1e30abe68246ba0a_2_570x500.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f0cbe7a2703412f1f7eaec8e1e30abe68246ba0a.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f0cbe7a2703412f1f7eaec8e1e30abe68246ba0a.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f0cbe7a2703412f1f7eaec8e1e30abe68246ba0a_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">582\u00d7510 20.4 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",
