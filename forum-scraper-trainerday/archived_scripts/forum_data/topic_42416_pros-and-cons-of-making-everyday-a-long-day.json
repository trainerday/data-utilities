The experts I respect the most feel that doing really long sessions indoors is risky from a anatomical health perspective.  If it is base and you really are doing z1/z2 type efforts you could do 7 days a week of 45 minutes for example\u2026 You could just use our HR+ mode and not follow a training plan for that.  Do the shortest sessions you can each day but trying to hit your weekly suggested hours.</p>\n<p>A weekly long ride has been a standard for a very long time and belief is it causes extra adaptions that shorter sessions don\u2019t create but I don\u2019t know if there is any solid evidence for this.  Especially during a base phase where weekly hours likely matters more than single session hours.  During a build phase where a long ride is z2/z3 and turns into a hard session then the weekly long ride likely matters more.</p>",

It really does matter, and I experienced this myself.<br>\nMy latest exploit, a little over a week ago, was 100km on foot in a total of 19h29m, moving time 18h12m.<br>\nI would have never been able to accomplish that if I didn\u2019t built up the long day.<br>\nFor those curious on how I prepared for it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to evaluate how much time you will need approximately. I set a more or less realistic goal of 18hr moving time with 1 longer rest for a warm meal and some shorter breaks to change clothing, grab a bite to eat and drink, for a total of 20hr.</li>\n<li>From your actual weekly hours (that would be the average weekly hours of the last 6 weeks), build up to 18 hours a week first. Build progressively, about 10% per week. Use TIME, not distance and don\u2019t care about speed. Speed will come with the volume. The important factor here is to be able to spent all that time on your feet, moving.</li>\n<li>Once you reach those 18 hours a week, keep the time volume per week equal but compound your hours. First set the goal of doing them in 5 consecutive days, then 4, 3, 2. Skip 6 because, normally you already should have 1 rest or very easy day during the build-up. For those compounding days, give yourself two weeks for each phase. If for whatever reason you can\u2019t keep up the planning, you\u2019re screwed if you only have one week. You can\u2019t stop life from getting in the way! So avoid extra stress by creating more flexibility in the plan.</li>\n<li>The last phase of 18 hours in 2 days, will for most turn out to be 18 hr in  36-40 hours followed by a night. Meaning that you should be ready to do them in one go (the event I did was with a 24hr limit). It is important to have a very good rest period of at least 7-10 days before the event. Only do some short, easy activity and sleep as much as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This worked well for me. My pace was pretty constant and HR was rock-solid just below 100 bpm for up to 85km. Then it eventually became harder and I started to struggle a bit. But compared to many others, I crossed the finish-line in pretty good condition.</p>\n<p>Each time I upped the long day, I sensed fatigue in the last part. But the next long day always went smooth for the time I did the former one. A single long session seems to be enough for the body to adapt and grow further.<br>\nIf you like the long and ultra-long events, the above information allows you to plan for it. And you can easily calculate how many weeks you will need to prepare for it.</p>",

Regading improving or increasing your mitochondria or mitochondrial function there are tons of people saying different things and no clear proof that one method is better than the other. I would say it seems more clear that total weekly volume contributes more than a single long ride but again their is no solid proof.  Best bang for your buck is doing blood flow restriction with mild HIIT workouts\u2026 but that is pure suffering and pros would rather just put in the time.  Again no proof.

Really my current training is very similar to what both you guys are saying here.</p>\n<p>I believe for some people, during a base phase they may rarely need rest days, as long as they are very good at taking it easy (real zone 2) and doing real recovery rides on the right days.</p>\n<p>Not saying 7 is best just that it can be fine and useful. I have only taken 2 days off in 4 weeks with this strategy, 15 hours biking outdoors last week. Normally I would only recommend this in specific cases though.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have any goals so I just built my weekend long ride up to 4/5 hours and started to think about what my indoor (hopefully mixed) season will look like.</p>\n<p>I also appreciate you focus on movement time. I 100% agree with this approach. No distance goals. Add other forms of movement is very healthy. Take it easy, smell the flowers.  Go hard when kit\u2019s fun.</p>",

Get yourself some packaging foam and put it under the trainer. Not the polystyrene that falls apart but the plastic variant. A thickness of 3 to 5 cm is ideal. It allows slight movement of the trainer and that\u2019s a huge difference compared to being absolutely fixed. Make sure to add the same thickness under the front wheel to remain level or you will get more load on the arms.<br>\nThe foam allows a little compression and thus side to side movement.

Anytime during the preparation, if it doesn\u2019t feel good, don\u2019t push. Just take a small step back and allow your body to adapt.
