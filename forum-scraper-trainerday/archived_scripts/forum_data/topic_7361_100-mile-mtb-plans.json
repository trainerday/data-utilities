      "cooked": "<p>As much as I like intervals, and your suggestion here has merit.  I think training to TSS is a risky approach when used by most cyclists, better used by a coach that understands the underlying physiological benefits of specific training intensities based on where the rider is in their season.  Training to TSS/CTL frequently drives the wrong behavior in training.  Cyclists obsess about maximizing CTL which comes at the expense of proper training, they start trying to substitue intensity for duration which is a very slippery slope.  Dr Seiler talks about this chasing numbers problems, and FTP, CTL and TSS are the worst culprits of this.</p>\n<p>Due to this chasing numbers problem is why I suggest/advise training focused on event duration because you can go out and ride and have fun and just try to build up your time in the saddle, get in a bit of slowly increasing structured training, not kill yourself adding more and more intensity because you are a bit behind in your CTL targets.</p>\n<p>I do feel that a PMC chart and especially TSB is very useful but when you get obsessed with daily/weekly TSS or CTL you frequently run into problems.  This is not just my opinion but the opinion of many.  I realize that many cyclists love chasing numbers and trying to maximize their CTL but usually a few seasons of this and they are burned out and come to more Polarized Training <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  I would say do what is fun for you but just be carful if you are trying to add intensity to make up for reduced time.</p>\n<p>Polarized training is anti-CTL\u2026 Coach Jack is both mostly Polarized as well as trying to keep TSB in check.</p>",
