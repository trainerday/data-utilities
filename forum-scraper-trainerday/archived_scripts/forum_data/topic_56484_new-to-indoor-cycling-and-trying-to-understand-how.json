I also don\u2019t have a HR monitor yet.</p>\n<p>When cycling, I match the power requirements, and for the last week it\u2019s been difficult to match the power output target of the slower sections as I was using near maximum resistance (another half turn on the knob locks the wheel). I\u2019m noticing that in some sections of the workout I\u2019m being asked to put down very low wattage as seemingly high rpms (see image). In my current setup to hit the 90-100rpm target I\u2019d be outputting like triple the power target.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6f6a4124fa4b03616af7fd9099832a71a309b117.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/6f6a4124fa4b03616af7fd9099832a71a309b117\" title=\"Screenshot_20250302-121144\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6f6a4124fa4b03616af7fd9099832a71a309b117_2_690x312.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_20250302-121144\" data-base62-sha1=\"fTCEclqB5WPibr8bvrxJltFLfM3\" width=\"690\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6f6a4124fa4b03616af7fd9099832a71a309b117_2_690x312.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6f6a4124fa4b03616af7fd9099832a71a309b117_2_1035x468.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6f6a4124fa4b03616af7fd9099832a71a309b117_2_1380x624.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"21283C\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">Screenshot_20250302-121144</span><span class=\"informations\">2700\u00d71224 105 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>I found that turning down the resistance allowed me to get 95rpm at 120W - but not having clips or proper form (maybe the issues\u2026?) and that sort of speed I start bouncing around in a way that feels improper.

      "cooked": "<p>Hi, sorry for the delay as I said.  Yes if you don\u2019t have ERG then you need to manually adjust the resistance including lowering it a lot to hit your targets and if you have to go high RPM you have to lower resistance even more.  I would say if it feels uncomfortably easy you might need to increase the power target but for most people 150w should not be uncomfortably easy even if they are very strong.</p>\n<p>One thing that would be good to understand is what trainer you have.  It\u2019s possible the power meter is not very accurate and slightly possible this could make easy too easy for example  Assuming you took a ramp test to find your 255w FTP.  But generally a basic bike is just fine.  The most important thing is riding consistently and that it feels reasonably comfortable (that is a longer discussion as to what that means).</p>\n<p>Bike weight is just for calculating speed and distance to try to get to be similar to what you would do outdoors.  So not important from a training perspective.  This should say \u201cOutdoor bike weight for reference\u201d or something.</p>\n<p>From a fitness and performance standpoint cadence (RPM) targets are very optional.  Most people do their best at the natural cadence.  The only reason to do RPM targets is to slowly over a long period of time increase your natural cadence which might make you a little faster, but from a fitness training perspective totally unnecessary.  If you are bouncy at 95 I would lower reduced your cadence and just push it up to where it is a little faster than your natural cadence but not bouncy (or don\u2019t worry about it at all).</p>\n<p>Having an HR monitor is a good idea, especially if you are not sure how accurate your power meter is on the bike as it is a cross reference to know how hard you are working and a few other reasons.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you have any more questions.  Happy to help and this time likely to answer a bit faster.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi Alex,</p>\n<p>Thanks for your detailed reply. Sorry for the delayed response; I rarely use a computer outside of work, and when I do, I\u2019m usually tunnel visioned on doing something. My burden for having a box of angry bees instead of a human brain <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":sweat_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":sweat_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>Your info has been invaluable in my training over the past two months. Coach Jack has pushed me hard, and I\u2019m seeing results. I\u2019ve just stopped using this trainer from Amazon: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0D9XM6ZV7\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0D9XM6ZV7</a>, in favour of a wahoo - but on our topic of accuracy\u2026</p>\n<p>I think the power meter of the spin bike is likely calculation based from the RPM of the flywheel of a known weight - but because it\u2019s like riding a fixie, you can dump excess power into the flywheel and sort of get it back out when you start flagging. The turbo trainer I\u2019m on now, will not let you do that - and adjusts the resistance to match your cadence - not to mention the freewheel robs you of the ability to get energy out of the flywheel! So the cheap spin bike might be \u201caccurate\u201d - but the actual mechanics of riding on that spin bike are noticeably different in a way that makes my legs ache haha.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to understand Coach Jack better. I believe it doesn\u2019t really understand the routines it is setting me - at least as far as you can apply \u201cunderstand\u201d to a generative model.<br>\nI just did this workout:<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/7/70d09b7952c130998f1aaf5469d0fc2820881a90.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/70d09b7952c130998f1aaf5469d0fc2820881a90\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/70d09b7952c130998f1aaf5469d0fc2820881a90_2_279x250.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"g60pMnFF2dlEolkFjiCv58WRM8E\" width=\"279\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/70d09b7952c130998f1aaf5469d0fc2820881a90_2_279x250.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/70d09b7952c130998f1aaf5469d0fc2820881a90_2_418x375.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/70d09b7952c130998f1aaf5469d0fc2820881a90_2_558x500.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"363848\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1224\u00d71094 69.9 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>Jack predicted Z1/Z2, but it wasn\u2019t at all!:<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0215428cd107bb43d9422156083dd7bf74a4cd57.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/0215428cd107bb43d9422156083dd7bf74a4cd57\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/0215428cd107bb43d9422156083dd7bf74a4cd57_2_345x246.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"iqvg8qgNbp4e5WEcF5pex5Qjen\" width=\"345\" height=\"246\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/0215428cd107bb43d9422156083dd7bf74a4cd57_2_345x246.jpeg, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/0215428cd107bb43d9422156083dd7bf74a4cd57_2_517x369.jpeg 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/0215428cd107bb43d9422156083dd7bf74a4cd57_2_690x492.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"303346\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1024\u00d7731 67.8 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div><br>\n<img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4513428b221e959f86faad3de940f37a7522601d.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"9R4d01d1br4jMXgaahKglYgWOGV\" width=\"487\" height=\"236\"><br>\n(data from Garmin FR55)</p>\n<p>My FTP was set via ramp test, and he knows my weight and HR zones, yet the plan seems misaligned.
