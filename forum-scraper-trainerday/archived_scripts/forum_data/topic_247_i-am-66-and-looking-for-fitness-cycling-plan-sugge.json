      "cooked": "<p>So I always talk about my pro-coach friend that really is the best from my perspective. He has been a pro coach for 30-years and is really the top of the top. He also recommends things different from most. So his philosophy as well as mine is most people should take a health first approach to fitness, and that is likely to produce as good or better results than a purely fitness first approach.</p>\n<p>He thinks virtually all amateurs should only train 3 or 4 hard days a week. If you are a pro in your 20s and all you do is train, and recover, then 5 and maybe 6. So for your 3-days a week is perfect. Some people recover well with a recovery ride and you can inject them if it does promote recovery but it\u2019s unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Second, he strongly suggests enjoying yourself and having fun. So you design a program and design intervals around what is enjoyable to you.  You do need to follow training fundamentals but some people might enjoy longer rests and longer intervals and another short intervals and short rests but the total time in zone might be the same and produce a similar enough training effect that it\u2019s fine to take the more enjoyable route.</p>\n<p>So all of this is not the mainstream American style of \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d which is taking more of a hold in Europe as well these days. I am an American in Europe, so I get both\u2026</p>\n<p>Joe Friel actually has strong roots in a health first approach as well but he injects so much fitness it\u2019s sometimes hard to read between the lines.</p>\n<p>I know I am not telling you what to do, but I am starting with the view point that your 3-days a week is a good plan from my (our) perspective. We both think strength training can be valuable but the right kind and the right amount and it is not necessarily necessary year round for top cycling fitness (for top performance many do it in the off-season). It also needs to be balanced with the type of cycling training you are doing.</p>\n<p>As Friel iterates stress management and recovery are key components to success.  Good sleep and your 3-days a week is a good start, just have to be careful with that strength training as too much anerobic activity in a week is not optimal for extended periods of time (hightly individual as to how much is ok).</p>\n<p>Joe in his book, fast after 50 suggests, many or most 50+ riders might need to inject a bit of high intensity each week just not to lose it. So base season might not be pure base. Most of us as we age start avoiding high intensity, and this might be part of the reason for decline. I am not sure what I think about this but I tend to believe Joe in this case. I don\u2019t think there are good studies for proof but I always try to always do a bit of HIIT or something. I believe it can be really short 4-tabata intervals might be enough. Anyway this is not my actual training suggestion, just a bit of understanding of where I am coming from.</p>",

If you feel like wanting to ride harder, just do it but not all the time, to avoid over-fatigue. Three or four rides a week \u201chaving fun\u201d riding should be all you need to comfortably finish those goals. A rule of thumb that I once read was: During 10 weeks, ride per week the expected duration of the event. According to this you should be able to do around 5 hours/week 11 weeks before the event. During 10 weeks increase a bit more to 6-7 hours/week and then dial it down for a rest week.<br>\nIf you just want to finish these rides comfortably without racing, that should be totaly OK.</p>",

You are paying attention to other people or hills or something.  I like Netflix style \u201ctraining\u201d where I don\u2019t think at all.  I just pedal.

As he gets close to the fall he should ride longer and longer at a comfortable pace. During winter he could do a base period (mostly easy riding) which might include a bit of HIIT.  Again following what Joe Friel suggests. But that spring early summer build period is the one likely where your main seasonal performance increase comes from and I am not specifying yet.  If he is not riding hard, periodization becomes less important.</p>",

All I did is gave him suggestions on how to be safe and do a bit of base training in the winter (rather than go hard all year). And for example as he started to increase his hours in the spring, I monitored his TSB (training stress balance) and just said\u2026 He you might want to take an easy week now\u2026   He had previously had heart surgery so no real coaches wanted to coach him.  I knew with my style of coaching I would reduce risk not increase it.  Anyway I am a strong believer is do what you enjoy and just inject a little other stuff.  If you ride a lot or very consistency then you have to pay attention to recovery as much as training.  Roger belives I was important to his success, , I would say other than keeping him safe, not so much</p>",
