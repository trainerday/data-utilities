After a few weeks my Vo2max had decreased. I use a garmin that gives me a aerobic and anaerobic training effect to see if the workout was effecting improving my cardio vascular fitness. This is really my main goal with cycling. I alternate with strength training when i do not cycle. During these workouts at zone 2, my training effect was low and had no impact on my aerobic fitness. I decided to do 75 mn this morning and got a training effect of 2.3 that is giving me  maintaining status. To impact my aerobic fitness, i need to reach a score of 3.0. I assume that i would have to ride 60 more mn to get to that. I do not have the time to ride 2 and half hour every morning. I guess this is great if you are a full time athlete and ride for living.</p>",

You should measure something that is much more accurate for example HR/power ratio over a longer period of time.  Their VO2max estimate is very dependent on your exact target power / hr again not accurate for fine tuning.</p>\n<p>For sure if you do pure low heart rate for a longer period of time you won\u2019t feel super strong and \u201cready to race.\u201d  It won\u2019t get you in top shape quickly.  It\u2019s really meant to be a part of a seasonal periodization plan.  It has some strong health components but if all you car about is current fitness level then for sure it is not what you want to do.</p>\n<p>I saw significant measured benefit doing 20 minutes a day 7 days a week.  Each person is unique.</p>\n<p>If you read Maffetone you realize making aerobic gains from strict zone 2 frequently requires a very focused effort.  For example he points out that many people combining weight training with low heart rate endurance work will completely stop any aerobic progress.</p>\n<p>So as you point out it is not for everyone.  It tends to be best for people that want to hit a peak outdoor spring time with a lot of high volume, hard cycling, people that seem to get sick often, people with high stress lives and people with a tendency to overtrain.  Also people that put health at much higher priority than fitness should take a closer look at more zone 2 work.</p>\n<p>For a person that just wants a smart simple year round pattern, polarized training year round at 6+ hours a week is a good choice and proven effective.</p>",

But like you said, did garmin implemented it well. I really never saw a Nike or peloton commercial but i know of them <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> My garmin is a fenix 6 so it is 5 years old. My friend just got an 8 and it seems like the training suggestion takes your previous workouts in consideration not to overtrain. But it is a computer. If i feel crummy when i wake up, it really does not matter what the watch or whoop is telling me. I really like to look at the training plans you have available and try them if i like them. That is what I like about TD. I make the choice. Thanks for all the advice though. I always like to learn more about physiology.</p>",

The problem is most people take this too literally and do too much pain with less than optimal micro gains and generally low work to results efficiciency.

So while Friel might have a fine method for setting zones (I have a lot of respect for Joe) that does not mean that the top of his zone 2 aligns with AeT.  I also believe San Milan and Attia have aligned it with a lactate level and this is not 100% accurate either and they are new to low HR training (I believe San Milan is scientist not long term coach of normal people) and I don\u2019t believe the experience to represent the masses.  Attia sounds really good and I was a huge fan but decided he is more of a salesman, much of his info requires more validation\u2026</p>\n<p>Maffetone\u2019s was a 20 year coach at the time of creating his formula, with an exclusive focus on low HR.  He is more qualified in my opinion.  Sure he created a simple formula that is likely not perfect for everyone, but he has tens to hundreds of thousands of people getting online and talking about their results\u2026 Now cycling probably even has more trying \u201czone 2\u201d but we don\u2019t have good communities of people doing testing and validating their AeT (yet). I never see any cyclists posting results from MAF tests.</p>\n<p>Cycling outdoors below AeT is very hard (running is too but switching to walking is easier than slowing down or walking on a bike\u2026), and it is also less necessary, meaning cyclists are less likely to get injured from over training.  There are millions training for marathons and getting destroyed and a lot less with the same struggles cycling.</p>\n<p>You also have to realize most athletes have a bias towards hard work.  So they are going to pick a methodology that allows them to perform \u201cZone 2\u201d as hard as possible.  In this case this is usually the wrong approach.  If you read Maffetone he makes this very clear.   You are better off going too low that going too high.</p>\n<p>You are an extreme outlier so in your case, I am guessing you are 42 years old and you are likely a candidate for +10 so your AeT might be closer to 148 based on his formula.  Ignore the terminology zone 2 in this case\u2026 Think in terms of fat burning and what walking feels like.  Below AeT should feel closer to walking then running.  Now maybe for you that is 160 but even going at 148 would give you 95% of the low heart rate benefits, maybe going up to 160 might give you that last little extra but comes with more risk.</p>\n<p>I also believe it\u2019s very easy to use the talk test to over estimate your AeT\u2026 I spent about 5 years studying this stuff fairly in depth (in running not cycling).  I am not saying everyone should blindly follow Maffetone\u2019s formula but if you read his work and follow his protocol, starting too low, seeing measurable results via MAF test and slowly raising it until you find your tipping point would be a fine zero risk approach.</p>\n<p>Becoming the optimum fat burner and tricking your body into thinking it is not doing anything is the way to accomplish that.  As soon as your body thinks, oh this is exercise I need energy it switches to carb burning and defeats most of the benefits of low HR training.  So recommending people go to 89% of LTHR would be much riskier and in Maffetone\u2019s findings not going to be below AeT and be primarily burning fat.</p>\n<p>Unlike you, I happen to be one that Maffetone 100% aligns with everything including blood oxygen levels, even though my max HR was about +10 over \u201caverage.\u201d  I did not try a mask so don\u2019t know if my 135 was truely the fat burn turning point.  But I know 100% my MAF tests improved significantly following his protocol.  What\u2019s interesting is as I started to slightly push above my triangulated AeT, I stopped seeing MAF test progress and backing down I would see progress again.  So maybe I am the exact test student for this.  I also did it with running not cycling.  I mentioned other places I went from not being able to run at 135bpm to easily \u201crunning\u201d at a faster pace at 100bpm.</p>\n<p>Without maf tests this is all theory, once you look at MAF test results then that\u2019s where theory hits reality.  So you have to decide who do you trust and what is fun for you.  If super low HR is not fun and you have no reason to need to do it, then do what ever you want <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">  I struggle with low HR on the bike outdoors so I fully get it if people don\u2019t want to do it.  It\u2019s not easy, becoming great is not easy, it takes a lot of mental dedication.</p>",
