I love to see them when companies do them but what I find is that if I feel the pulse of what is going on on a daily basis I adjust things all the time. Roadmaps can easily set expectations for people that then cause frustration if you don\u2019t follow them.  Many companies just follow a plan even if that plan is not the best plan at the moment.  But you are right at the minimum I do know what we are doing for the next 2-4 weeks and even visibility to that would be nice.  I also know our general big picture goals.</p>\n<p>So we are getting to the point that TD is on the road to getting big, and we need to get more mature.  So let me share it here and I will think about a long term strategy.  We partially use trello but we should get better at this and we could make it public.</p>\n<p>Big picture goals for 2024</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rock solid app stability for as many of our supported devices as possible.</li>\n<li>Improve usability / simplify and make stuff as obvious as possible for both the new user and existing.  TrainerRoad is super good a this for example, we are so/so\u2026</li>\n<li>Bring more features from the web to the app</li>\n<li>Improve the outdoor experience</li>\n<li>Add more intelligence to the TODAY feature</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are a couple of big things we are working on right now that I don\u2019t want to share yet as I don\u2019t really know where they are going exactly <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  I should be able to share once the concepts stabilize a bit more, I hope in the next 30-60 days.  One of them will be a killer outdoor feature if it works like we expect it to.</p>\n<p>Some of the smaller ones are</p>\n<ol>\n<li>App - add a back button (really on the fly inserting of intervals very quickly)</li>\n<li>Some app workout screen small improvements</li>\n<li>Strava / Intervals sync improvements</li>\n<li>Lots of small bug fixes on web and app that affect smaller number of users</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I will try review and add to this smaller list soon.</p>",

TSS level is based mostly on the setting at the bottom called \u201cride feel.\u201d  I would have to review it but a simple change might just be to make this ride feel have different ramp rates, it\u2019s actually possible it does this now, I designed this a long time ago and don\u2019t remember.

It would be more likely something that would be ready for next spring if we get a bit ahead.  Even though you are the first to actually request this, and / or fully comprehend the idea, I do know others would appreciate it, especially those with the TrainerRoad/TrainingPeaks CTL based mindset that are very time crunched.  As I said I am not sold that this is the best even for time crunched\u2026 But my opinion is my opinion and that does not make it right\u2026 I was big believer in this approach for years, I just moved away from it.  Not that I don\u2019t see a value in PMC details in general, more just that it\u2019s hard to substitute intensity for volume and get the desired results, especially long term.

      "cooked": "<p>So workouts should get harder, and via harder they will have more TSS but TSS increase is the result not the goal (a subtle but important difference).  You can set daily limits in our app and it will do this now.  The other thing is that you don\u2019t need to work super hard at the beginning of a build process.  It can feel super easy so 1 minute at threshold, 2m, 3m\u2026 increasing each week and at the end of 16 weeks could be 2 X 8m at threshold or something.  This is logical muscle and physiological adaption increase. It never feels super hard until getting to the end of a longer block and you should be prepared and it should just be hard.  Starting with 2 X 7 and going to 2 X 20 over 16 weeks is completely un-necessary.  If you love suffering it\u2019s fine but you are getting a minimal benefit over easy going to moderately hard and taking significantly more risk.</p>\n<p>So this thinking is just like lifting a little heavier weight or more reps, not trying to increase your TSS at the gym.  <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  TSS is great to monitor over training and generally it should be going up a bit you just don\u2019t need to spend your time trying to maximize your TSS/CTL unless it\u2019s via volume.</p>",
