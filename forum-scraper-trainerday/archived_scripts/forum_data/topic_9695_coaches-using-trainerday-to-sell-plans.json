      "cooked": "<p>Hi all,</p>\n<p>I recently posted a comment on a YouTube channel about using Coach Jack and its easily personalised plans. The comment ended up being deleted, the person running the channel is a coach themselves and I believe may have deleted it because it might have affected their business model. I\u2019ve used this coach before for cycling training and found the fundamentals to be pretty straightforward and similar to coach jack, but it did make me wonder if coaches are using Coach Jack to their advantage too easily sell personalised plans. I thought this might be an interesting topic for discussion. Has anyone else had any experiences or thoughts on this?</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Very interesting and yes Coach Jack is not ideal for coaches for taking their business.  Generally, our belief is that coaches need to move away from thinking that custom training plans are their main value, but maybe that is the primary value from their customers vantage point.  I don\u2019t know if that is why you chose a coach for example.  I think the writing is on the wall for this.  One value I see coaches providing is the deep understanding of the individual and their needs and making them feel confident they are understood and then putting them in a \u201ctraining/lifestyle bucket\u201d that they are comfortable with.  Software will be able to do this, especially with all the wearable technlogy but still not there yet.</p>\n<p>I have never heard of any Coach designing plans to sell or even using Coach Jack other than one ex-pro rider coaching his son.  You can see below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.trainerday.com/a-cyclist-and-his-coach-2dd63b2dc453\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://blog.trainerday.com/a-cyclist-and-his-coach-2dd63b2dc453</a></p>\n<p>But yes I do think you are right that Coaches could use Coach Jack to design their plans but I think most would not for one reason or the other.</p>",

I enjoy creating my own training programs, and I noticed that the programs provided by this coach were very similar to ones that I found online from Coach Jack. I opted for online coaching due to my shift work schedule, which didn\u2019t allow me to meet with a coach in person. I found it interesting that many coaches sell customized plans, asking all the fundamental questions that Coach Jack asks to tailor a plan. I probably didn\u2019t get as much benefit due to being a pretty motivated person coming from a powerlifting background, and willing to learn and then create my own plans.</p>",

Yeah, I think a coach can be very valuable, especially because humans are not very good about being objective/subjective when thinking about themselves.  \u201cYeah, I am fine, just because increased my riding by 3X more hours, my knees really hurt and I am totally sick, I feel good enough for that hard workout.\u201d  Or taking data and making poor choices because of data (trying to maximize CTL at all cost). I see the data problem mostly due to all the confusing information out there.  But yes, many of us start with a coach and learn quickly and learn how to self coach, with the help of some tools like Coach Jack and can do a good job, especially after a few mistakes\u2026 <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>",
