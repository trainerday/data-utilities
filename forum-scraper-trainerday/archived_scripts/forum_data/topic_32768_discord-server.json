Have you considered a companion Discord server for TD users to connect and discuss cycling and training as a broader community? Discord seems a bit more conducive to real time engagement and discussion. Would love to connect with others here and discuss training plans, success, advice, etc. I\u2019m sure you need another community to manager like a hole in the head, Alex. But I thought I would put it out there to see what you (or others) thought. Could be a cool way to built the TD community that I\u2019m already loving.</p>",

If other people get around this idea I am fine re-creating a discord server.</p>\n<p>This forum actually works surprisingly well for real-time as well but I know what you mean some how discord/telegram/IM feels better for real time.  Maybe the dedicated app helps.
