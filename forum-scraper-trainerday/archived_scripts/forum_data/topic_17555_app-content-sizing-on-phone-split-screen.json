We are obviously very low cost and also not big like the leaders in the field but growing quickly. I say this because I want to be 100% transparent that we can add this to our list but since this is the first request for this it is less likely to get prioritized very soon.</p>\n<p>Sorry I don\u2019t have a better answer but being on small budgets we have to be careful what we work on and when.  We have to focus on critical stuff first.</p>",

I bet if I asked my developer he would say 3-hours to fix it and then he would spend 2-days fixing the unexpected side effects.  It frequently happens I ask for something that seems small and it gets big fast.  I am a developer too but not doing this work.</p>\n<p>Any, I love happy customers more than anything else so it is really hard for me to say this is going to have to wait but anything I see that is for one person that has potential side effects I have to be careful about and prioritize correctly.  It\u2019s never 1 person but one voice and a small number of silent people.  I hope you understand.  I guess tablet would be better but then you need a tablet bike mount\u2026</p>",
