I do however have a speed and cadence sensor.  Both seem to connect to your app, which is great.</p>\n<p>However in the app, I only get cadence showing.  There doesn\u2019t appear to be anywhere on the app screen displaying speed., or distance (which I\u2019d assumed would also be clocked up).  I saw elsewhere that perhaps speed/distance was just a feature of uploading to strava. However again, strava does not seem to have any speed/distance data.</p>\n<p>Am I missing something?</p>\n<p>(I know the sensors work, as I\u2019ve trialed Zwift with the same setup, and it picks up both sensors to give me cadence/speed (and virtual power in the case of zwift)).</p>",
