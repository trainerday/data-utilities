Outdoor, it\u2019s not easy to adapt a workout, however few rides on the same path with recording of speeds + powers + the current ride being made, it\u2019s possible to find where intervals can be done and move them if it was no possible. Like a live coach will do.</p>\n<p>This is not done anywhere less, I know Trainerday is not really made to record anything outdoor yet, but there is a window here to live coaching. I\u2019m even willing to help (I was thinking to quickly build an app for me to do that, but I don\u2019t have enough time to dig once more into Android SDK, ADB\u2026).</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nAlex.</p>",
