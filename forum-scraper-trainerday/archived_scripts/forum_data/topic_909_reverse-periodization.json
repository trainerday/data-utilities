I\u2019m going to try Reverse Linearized Periodization and focus on intensity during the winter. Shorter and less boring sessions\u2026 I want to try out the TCTP program from CTS but I\u2019m going to reduce stress by extending my \u201cweeks\u201d to 9 days iso 7. At my age (57), it\u2019s probably safer to build in some more recovery.<br>\nFact is that I\u2019m never racing and my main events during spring/summer are long duration events at fairly low intensity. So when daylight clock changes end of March, I will start focussing on duration and low intensity. Probably going Polarised at that time with a single hard session per week for strenght/speed maintenance. The rest will be longer rides outside at low intensity and one group ride on Sundays (which usualy isn\u2019t really hard for me, unless the real tough guys are all present).<br>\nThat should follow the rules of doing more specific work getting closer to my target events as in Joe Friels logic.</p>",

The problem is winter anerobic benefits are mostly lost by the time you get to peak season and you don\u2019t really need 5+ months of ANEROBIC focus so he keeps pushing me back to traditional linear periodization.  I think I am going to figure out how to sell it to him to help me design the perfect compromise :slight_smile <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> He knows team sky made it work some how\u2026  Requires more research.  Maybe CTS has it figured out.  I like and respect much of what I hear from CTS (not sure about all of it) but I also believe they are sales focused organization so they do what sells and hard winters is an idea that sells. i.e \u201cSweet spot base\u201d <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>Regardless this idea totally aligns with so many people riding style that if it can work it\u2019s great.  Meaning hard winter and polarized during the spring sumer totally makes sense too.  This is exactly one annual training plan (ATP) I planed on creating when we launch our coach jack ATP features.</p>\n<p>The second idea is how to a perfect traditional periodization plan that transitions from a winter indoors into spring outdoors in the way that fits the \u201ctraveller/trip\u201d style of riding.  This can mean starting your build period earlier than most serious racers do, so maybe start build in early December and finishing build in March which also can be done by finishing with more of a polarized approach. The down side is that Feb/March are big months and a Feb big month indoors is not great.  I am working on a Coach Jack solution to these for sure and will plan on offering both options.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/alex\">@Alex</a> Don\u2019t worry. i was absolutely not planning on doing 5 months of HIT. I plan to do one cycle of the TCTP program. Since the program works to a peak at 8-9 weeks and I will extend weeks to 9 days, that will make about 11 weeks. If things go well, i will start about half december but my situation is not really normal at this point\u2026<br>\nI had a thyroid lobectemy 11 days ago to chirurgically remove the right half of my thyroid. The reason is there was an overactive nodule in the right half that produced way too much thyroid hormone.<br>\nI was eating like a horse and still loosing weight. Continously overactive and consequently exhausting my body and overloading my stomach.<br>\nI\u2019m feeling quite well at this point and last week I tried a simple aerobic session on the trainer. Things felt ok for the first 30-40 min. Then, within a couple of minutes, it started getting hard, really hard, impossible to continue\u2026 I never felt tired, was nose-breathing and my heartrate was low. Nevertheless, in a couple of minutes I was halted as if my pedals were turning in concrete\u2026<br>\nTried again last Friday, same symptoms. Called the endocrinologist today and she told me i shouldn\u2019t worry. On the contrary, she said that it looks very promising and that probably the left half of my thyroid was in the process of taking over all the work. I was relieved to hear that. Did another low intensity session today at 60% and was able to complete 75 min of endurance work without any negative impact.<br>\nTo give you an idea of the impact of the chirurgical intervention, my resting HR in the morning dropped by 11 beats from one day to another. HRV is continously high compared to the last 2 months average. Slowly getting some weight back. I can now settle in the couch and really relax, without having to force myself to get calm.<br>\nSo from here to about half december, I\u2019m not going to do any structured or hard training. I\u2019m just going to go by feel and my focus will be on minimizing loss off Aerobic fitness. If by half december, my hormone levels are stable and the doctor gives me green light, I will get back to serious (but controlled) training.<br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/baboune\">@Baboune</a> I\u2019m since 2000 a technical engineer specialized in neurological diagnostic equipment and have some experience in pneumologie and cardiologie. Apart from the COVID period, there is a yearly congress for physiologists and cardiologists at our company where they always ask for someone to perform a pulmonary function test with gas-exchange, lactate and ECG monitoring. I\u2019m always candidate number one and had the occasion of doing a full lab test free-of-charge already three times. I have a pretty good idea where my VO2max is <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9\" title=\":smiley:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smiley:\"> and I can tell that it isn\u2019t close to what Garmin or Polar is trying to convince me off\u2026</p>",
