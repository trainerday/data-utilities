      "cooked": "<p>I fully agree with you on the importance of predictability.  My guess is this happens to less than 1% of all the workouts performed.</p>\n<p>We really don\u2019t know when it will have this problem or not.  People can have newer devices but have lots of things running that we are not aware of and it can cause this problem as well, it seems to happen more on iOS then Android, or possibly only on iOS.  If someones battery gets below 20% which we also have no visibility to it can go into low power mode which slows things down.  It can happen in workouts as short as 60 minutes in the worst case scenarios.</p>\n<p>But to your point when it starts happening I think we might be able to catch it and warn someone which would be better than having to come to the forum and ask.  I also believe when the clock starts running slow, putting the app in the background and bringing it back can improve it.  The biggest problem is we have a lot of devices and can\u2019t replicate this no matter how long we run workouts, so when you can\u2019t repeat it, it makes it hard to fix or even know how to identify it.  We have run 3 hour tests and all are 100% accurate on all our devices with a variety of workouts.  If we had big money like TrainerRoad does we could devote a lot more effort to solving this but we are still so small.  But it is always a top priority to fixing so we come back to it again and again.  Slowly we improve performance and it happens less and less often.</p>\n<p>Sorry for the long response that sounds like an excuse, it is very frustrating / sad for us as well.</p>",

I\u2019ve seen the other tread on this and so about every 30 /45 mins will put the app in the background as suggested and this does work although once I saw the time speed up to 4/5 times normal when brought back to the foreground - I put it in the background and brought it forward again and the clock returned to normal speed (albeit it was now a minute or more up on where it should have been).</p>\n<p>I use an iPad Air 2 running the latest (for it) iOS 15.7.5. I appreciate this is an old machine (2015) but has essentially nothing else on it as it\u2019s just used for turbo training and runs plugged in.</p>\n<p>The iPad is old but still a pretty powerful machine judging by the impressive games it can still run and whilst I\u2019m no expert in any way I\u2019d assume Trainer Day could be made to run effectively too.</p>\n<p>I appreciate most people probably run newer/faster machines than me but to paraphrase you above - an app used to time stuff that can\u2019t keep reliable time is a bit frustrating.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not technical but more than happy to help you out with trying to provide some insight/data/testing to help track the issue down - just let me know if there is anything I can do.</p>\n<p>cheers</p>\n<p>Stephen</p>",

It\u2019s one of the best technologies for this but it is not as efficient as native code, and it does not have the concept of a millisecond accurate timer, so we have to make millisecond adjustments each second to keep things accurate.  When things run slow or fast we are trying to speed it up that is why you see this catch up process.</p>\n<p>So anyway, we would have to re-write our app and have a bigger team to support native code.

Using my ancient iPhoneX I don\u2019t seem to have the problem, but I haven\u2019t used that for a workout over 60 minutes yet.  For my 70 minute workout today on the iPad I was still slogging away with over 30 minutes left after an hour and a half had elapsed.  Using the stopwatch on the iPhone I see it was running about 1/2 speed on the iPad.<br>\nThe session was never in the background on the iPad.</p>\n<p>Thanks.<br>\nPeter.</p>",
