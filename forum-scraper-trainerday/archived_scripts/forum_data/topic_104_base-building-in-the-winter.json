No one can work hard all year round and continue to improve unless maybe it is their first couple of years of training\u2026  Even then it\u2019s not a great idea.  If you have a very non-traditional approach to periodization there might be some exceptions to this, but this is the general rule for 95% of the people and any standard periodization programs.</p>\n<p>I would say that one build/peak per year is typical although some people can do two shorter seasons in a year.  So if you want to peak in may/june that means you need Oct-Jan 1st or so as a time to prepare you for this intense build and peak period.</p>\n<p>I see someone created a simple base period.  I would replace 1-ride per week with a zone 1 but still nice to see someone creating a real base plan yesterday.  I am sure there are others, I just noticed this one.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/fada7b5d2fef06e5d0f2e024fe5aaa3075882d8b.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/fada7b5d2fef06e5d0f2e024fe5aaa3075882d8b\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/fada7b5d2fef06e5d0f2e024fe5aaa3075882d8b_2_690x320.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"zN9sHp20wKxwuqwll8REgmshhfJ\" width=\"690\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/fada7b5d2fef06e5d0f2e024fe5aaa3075882d8b_2_690x320.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/fada7b5d2fef06e5d0f2e024fe5aaa3075882d8b_2_1035x480.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/fada7b5d2fef06e5d0f2e024fe5aaa3075882d8b.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/fada7b5d2fef06e5d0f2e024fe5aaa3075882d8b_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1291\u00d7599 50.3 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>Link below<br>\n</p><aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <a href=\"https://app.trainerday.com/plans/training-plan-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">app.trainerday.com</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img src=\"\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"\" height=\"\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://app.trainerday.com/plans/training-plan-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trainer Day</a></h3>\n\n\n\n  </article>\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>Anyone else out there doing a real tradtional base for the winter?

      "cooked": "<p>Base building for myself and most of the athletes I work with is much more traditional than what you see being \u201cpopular\u201d these days, but it\u2019s not completely traditional in the sense of only Zone2 progressing duration unless the athlete has lots of time.</p>\n<p>Most of the athletes I work with (myself included) have about 8-12 hours to train each week. Within this range, I like to start off with a prep phase of pure Z2, then I progress into a base phase where throughout the entire base phase we go from having 1 \u201csweet-spot\u201d workout per week all the way to 2-3 threshold workouts by the end of the base phase. Most of these phases last 3-4+ months, but of course it\u2019s very individual (some respond better to more z2, others better to slightly more intensity). Progressive overload is very similar throughout the phase. We are progressing <em>time</em> not <em>power</em>, so for example I might start the SweetSpot at say 2x20, then progress to a 3x15, then a 1x45, then a 3 x 20, 2x30 etc. Same goes for Threshold (progressing time and TTE rather than trying to push that number higher). For zone2 riding I like to see overloading of about 30mins extra per week on the longer ride. So if the longest ride of the week starts at 1hr, the next week would be 1.5, then 2 \u2192 2.5, until we are at a sustainable level where we will stay as the intensity increases.</p>\n<p>Experience is a big component\u2026 Some athletes have 10+ years of training under their belts, but still have limited time. In my opinion and from what I\u2019ve see is there is only so much that more z2 will get them with limited time, so we add a little bit more lower-end intensity.<br>\nOthers are much more new to the sport, where almost anything will see improvements, so we don\u2019t do much intensity (if at all) and just progressively overload the z2 rides.</p>\n<p>So to answer the question\u2026 yes\u2026 kind of traditional base <em>especially</em> compared to the base training you see nowadays with way too much intensity. However, that\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t do a <strong>lot</strong> of Zone 2 riding or riding around 1.3-1.8mmol/La. This is extremely important to manage fatigue and get the adaptations needed for a long season ahead.</p>\n<p>One other thing is that I do much more realistic and longer FTP tests, so I don\u2019t run the risk of overestimating FTP. I find a lot of people overestimate their FTP, which makes it even worse when they are doing higher intensity base training.</p>\n<p>I really liked this podcast episode from a very experienced coach titled \u201cWhat is base really?\u201d. I feel it fits well with what I\u2019ve seen personally<br>\n</p><aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.empiricalcycling.com/podcast-episodes/watts-doc-7-what-is-base-really\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Empirical Cycling</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/97447cc3472b0054d62a8f8b11467d61b68e367f.png\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" width=\"277\" height=\"277\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.empiricalcycling.com/podcast-episodes/watts-doc-7-what-is-base-really\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Watts Doc #7: What Is Base Really?</a></h3>\n\n<p>Copyright \u00a9 2019</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n",

      "cooked": "<p>Robert, have you read Friel\u2019s fast after 50?  I am with you 100% on not follwing a strict training plan.  I think very few people should other than those that have a coach or maybe if they have complete control over their life with total predictability.   That said the problem with Friel is he combines fundamentals with detailed plannning, so it\u2019s a huge amount of details and becomes overwhelming.  I would argue but just getting you to follow the core fundamentals without seriously altering your lack of plan training style we can make you faster.</p>\n<p>An interesting thing about Friel is that I am good friends with a 30-year grand tour pro coach.  He is not coaching pros directly now but still an advisor to many pro-teams.  He even coached one TDF winner.  Anyway the interesting thing is that regarding fundamentals he is always quoting Friel and generally agrees with what he says.  I would say he has a lot of details that are different but the fundamentals are the most important part and those are essentially the same.  I think many top coaches are the same.  What I see coming out of CTS is the same.  Periodization is one such fundamental.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>So I have told this story multiple times but you may not have heard it and I will give a different angle on it here.  I ended up accidentally re-connecting with the father of a highschool friend on Strava (Roger).  Roger and I started talking and some how I became his coach.  Because Roger was 75-years old and had previous heart surgery, no one wanted to coach him.  I am not a real coach but I do know lots of the fundamentals and I knew my style would reduce his risks not increase them.  Roger trained like you do, year round same training Z3/Z4.  He was fast but he wanted more.   I convinced him to start doing periodization.  At 75 he was nervous he would loose his fitness but he said he would try it.  He did a winter of pure Z1/Z2.  The only thing he did was every two weeks a ramp test.  He did go from 210 FTP to 205 by the end of the winter.  Starting spring he followed his normal training the only difference was we monitored his build process using TrainingPeaks and got him to build up slowly to a higher number of hours per week by April/May (about 10-13 hours a week).  When his TSB would get too low I would tell him to back off.  He did 3/1 recovery pattern.</p>\n<p>So during the spring he realized he felt amazing and had way more energy and motivation that previous seasons which resulted in him starting to lead his fast group rides with the 50-year olds.  His FTP reached a peak of 225 @ 68kg.  He was very excited.  Roger went on to win his state championship and qualify for the US senior olympics.   I will explain later the stuff I told him to do but really all I did is tell him to do less, and train less hard.  I told my pro-friend this story and he said I just got lucky and found a good athlete which is 100% true <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>I will respond more soon\u2026</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>One thing for sure is that in my opinion, far too many people do too much SweetSpot and Threshold training in their early season training. Also, the individuality is so important. I wish there was just a plain and simple one-size-fits-all approach, but there\u2019s too many factors to make things so broad. As long as the fundamentals are in place, going from there works for most people.</p>\n<p>As far as the definition goes, it\u2019s probably not the traditional \u201cbase\u201d. I do a longer \u201cbase phase\u201d and a shorter \u201cbuild phase\u201d, but as the base phase progresses, the muscular endurance workouts become more involved \u2013 again, depending on how many hours the athlete is training and their experience overall (keeping recovery always in mind).</p>\n<p>Friel does his \u201cBase 3\u201d where he begins to include a lot more muscular endurance work, and then does 2 phases of Build 1 and Build 2 which equates to 2 months (with a 3/1 recovery cycle) as I\u2019m sure you know. There\u2019s not too much difference than what I\u2019m saying here. But if athletes don\u2019t have any more time so they can\u2019t overload with volume, different things need to happen to reach the same adaptations. Those \u201cthings\u201d are, however highly individualized.

Too much sweetspot and hard efforts too much of the year.  Not enough variation.  So people work hard too much and they don\u2019t gain as much as they cool by taking it systematically easier.</p>",

Especially looking at base training as a rest period that you are just holding on to what you have more than a strong aerobic adaptation period (especially if you are not putting in big hours).  I would say the true expert in hard core base training is Phil Maffetone but his specialty is fixing broken runners and triathletes and gets them to their best. Cyclists usually are not so broken.  Also Maffetone\u2019s focus is below this first ventlatory threshold, similar to polarized training.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>I can\u2019t find Friels chart now but it was the same as this. Annually you train more than TDF racers. Why don\u2019t they train more? Because it negatively affects their performance. They are in their 20s, don\u2019t have a job, and still don\u2019t have enough time to recover in order to be able to train more. Again, you sound happy and healthy and obviously can handle a lot. So if it is for fun, enjoy, if you want to maximize performance I bet almost all top coaches would agree, you could improve by doing less and introduce bigger seasonal differences.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/1X/c0d88d7cdc31af62f0dda91a520c29096457e712.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/c0d88d7cdc31af62f0dda91a520c29096457e712\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/c0d88d7cdc31af62f0dda91a520c29096457e712_2_500x500.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"rvZDs0cJ4F3YvJ5JSSzqd1lWQf0\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/c0d88d7cdc31af62f0dda91a520c29096457e712_2_500x500.jpeg, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/c0d88d7cdc31af62f0dda91a520c29096457e712_2_750x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/c0d88d7cdc31af62f0dda91a520c29096457e712_2_1000x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/c0d88d7cdc31af62f0dda91a520c29096457e712_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1080\u00d71080 208 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",
