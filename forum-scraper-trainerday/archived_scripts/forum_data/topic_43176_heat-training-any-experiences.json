Due to a back problem, I had a bit of a setback in my training schedule.  I came across the fuzz related to heat training.  And in the most recent video of Remco Evenepoel on his comeback, he was also doing heat training.  Well, I guess nobody can say his comeback didn\u2019t work.</p>\n<p>I did a bit of background search and it seems you can gain about 5% on your FTP in 3 weeks\u2026  Sound like a tempting option to me.</p>\n<p>Anybody with experience ?

      "cooked": "<p>I only have my own data to go off of, but I did start heat training this summer after being convinced by the \u201cSome Work All Play\u201d running podcast that I listen to which talks a lot about training principles and theory.</p>\n<p>They have cited several recent studies showing how quickly you increase blood volume and red blood cells (which come with obvious fitness gains), but also how fast you lose those changes after stopping heat training. Due to this, they recommend heat training year round using a protocol of twice a week during build and peak (in-season) and once a week in the off-season to maintain. They also provide some guidance on how to tell if you are getting your core hot enough using RPE if you don\u2019t have a way to measure your temp. Basically if you are at an aerobic or easy Z2 power, and your HR is unusually high (assuming you are staying well fueled/hydrated), it means your core temp has raised high enough that you are in the \u201cheat-training\u201d zone. Then try to stay in this state for 45-60 minutes. They did say it doesn\u2019t seem to matter when you do this. So before or after doing your main training for the day. If I remember correctly, the Remco video you are talking about he did it before going out for his normal training ride. In contrast, if you watch Precision Hydration\u2019s video on how Lotto Dstny heat train, they had their riders doing it after their normal ride for the day.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I started using the above method and doing heat training twice a week. I didn\u2019t add any time, but during my indoor 2 hr endurance rides, I would just shut off my fans and throw on a coat with the hood up for the last 45-60 minutes. Within a few minutes my HR would start drifting up to the mid-150s where it would normally be in the high 130s or low 140s. My breathing seemed very labored for the power being put out. I ended up having to buy some headbands because sweat would be pouring down my face. Also learned to completely cover my trainer bike in towels.</p>\n<p>As far as performance gains, FWIW I have been putting out my best ever numbers in the past few weeks. However I can\u2019t attribute this all to heat training. With all my key race events happening in August, I also came off a very high intensity training block in July to peak for these events.</p>\n<p>I can assure you though that heat training is having some adaptations on my body, although I notice it the most with my heat tolerance in everyday life. For example, this summer while vacationing at the beach or attending an outdoor festival in very hot weather, I was quite comfortable while everyone around me was complaining non-stop. I even noticed at home how I could keep the thermostat higher and feel just as comfortable. This makes sense after reading up a bit on it, with one study I found that showed that doing one hour of light exercise a day for two weeks lowered participants perceived temp by 10-12 degrees. Pretty incredible.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>What a great answer Tayno_25. I have been doing heat training for two years. My main reason for doing this is that my performance used to drop in hot weather. With heat training I can sustain my power output even in hot weather.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t wear extra clothing and keep my fan on, but I use a heater next to my fan, which now blows hot wind.</p>\n<p>I have a thermometer in the room, too, so I can see how hot it is. I start with 20 degrees Celcius and build it up.</p>\n<p>A word of caution, though: Hot temperatures bring extra stress to the body. Make sure that your drinking strategy is good and adapted to this training. Keep a close watch on how your body is reacting, and don\u2019t overdo it. The risk of a heat stroke is real and dangerous.</p>\n<p>Use your own heart rate, not others\u2019, as a comparison. Heart rates are very personal.</p>\n<p>A cold shower afterward is not a good idea. Research shows that rapid cooling reduces the growth effect of training. Cooling is an effective strategy to speed recovery, but not if you train to get faster.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Happy to share the outcome of what I tried.</p>\n<p>So : while I had a good preparation (with a lot of base training combined with HIIT sessions), I struggled since half of August with some backpain.  I had a 4 days event end of September.  The back pain stopped me from doing the preparation I would have like to do.  About 3 weeks before the event, the backpain was almost gone.  So I made a 3 weeks training program based on heat training.  My idea was : the damage is done, lets just try this out.<br>\nMy training scheduled looked like this :</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Tuesday, 3 September 2024</th>\n<th></th>\n<th>60min @ 50% FTP indoor, no fan</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Wednesday, 4 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Outdoor ride with climbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thursday, 5 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>60min @ 60% FTP indoor, no fan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Friday, 6 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>outdoor ride @ treshold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saturday, 7 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>60min @ 50% FTP indoor, no fan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sunday, 8 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Long outdoor ride</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monday, 9 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>rest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tuesday, 10 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>60min @ 50% FTP indoor, no fan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wednesday, 11 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Outdoor ride with climbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thursday, 12 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>60min @ 65% FTP indoor, no fan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Friday, 13 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>outdoor ride @ treshold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saturday, 14 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>60min @ 50% FTP indoor, no fan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sunday, 15 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Long outdoor ride</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monday, 16 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>rest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tuesday, 17 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>60min @ 50% FTP indoor, no fan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wednesday, 18 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Outdoor ride with climbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thursday, 19 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>60min @ 70% FTP indoor, no fan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Friday, 20 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>outdoor ride @ treshold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saturday, 21 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>60min @ 50% FTP indoor, no fan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sunday, 22 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Long outdoor ride</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monday, 23 September 2024</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>rest</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>The result was beyond my expectations.  The 4-days event went really well, with some PB when it comes to power output.  Even more interesting : I have to take a couple of rest days after the event.  But since then I smashed my 8min, 20min, 30min and 60min power PB.  The 3 weeks \u201ctraining plan\u201d were really not as hard as I would have wanted. And were from a time perspective below what I would normally have done.  But I will do this again in the future.</p>",
