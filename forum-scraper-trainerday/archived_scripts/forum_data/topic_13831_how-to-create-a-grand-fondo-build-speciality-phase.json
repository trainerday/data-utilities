I saw this and then forgot about it.</p>\n<p>So Coach Andrea recommends the serious Italian to all his athletes averaging at 6 hours a week or more for a build period.</p>\n<p>So it depends on how many week you have left until your event but generally the specialy phase or what we call the peak phase is mostly about your long ride. Especially important for the Gran Fondo.  In general your entire season should be focused on the long ride but it is much more important in the build and specialty phases.  Everything else is icing on the cake.</p>\n<p>Although TR\u2019s plan might work fine for some people I don\u2019t think that is the best suggestion.  One long ride, one threshold and one strength endurce each week gives you that best diversity.  The three are very different.  We have on peak block with dynamic force in it.  That would be my favorite and Andrea\u2019s recommendaion.  It would give you both your strength endurance as well as some of that higher intensity.</p>\n<p>Other than your 3 core days the rest should by Z2 or Z1.</p>\n<p>We have multiple people reporting the best results they have ever seen using the serious italian block for a build phase.  One said after 3-years of TR they gained more/faster with 11-weeks of the serious italian then they ever did in TR.</p>",

Meaning if you do squats at the gym you probably do up to maybe 20 reps usually more in the 5-12 range.  This would be like doing 1,000 body weight squats, so it\u2019s pretty different.  But also for sure some people just don\u2019t like low RPM work.  Another thing you can try is dynamic force.  It is a very similar resistance but at at more normal RPM ranges.

Running was all zone 2 (5 zone model), 2-3 hours a week. Biking ~4-5 hours, 2x1h (SFR was one of the workouts) and a \u201clong\u201d ride, winter biking indoors for all of it. Worked up to a 5 hour long ride outside before the race.</p>\n<p>My background is american football (retired professional), offensive lineman (I like to refer to myself as a 5second athlete). I have ~25 years of strength training. Ftp/kg is relatively low 2.2 (280ftp, athletic 125kg).

I love sprints and loath sweet spot workouts.</p>\n<p>I usually perform below my ftp (ramp test) with the exception of zone 5 and SFR.

      "cooked": "<p>Ok so I talked to Andrea.  So because you are a triathlete and it is easy to push yourself too far, then you should not add too much intensity.  If you were not a triathlete he would suggest some HIIT.  Ultimately for your size and as you pointed out fairly low w/kg, it\u2019s really that aerobic component we need to build up.  Trying to determine if that is a central limiter or perifial might help figure out what is the best for you.  We could try to determine this just with a ramp test.</p>\n<p>He still was a little surprised that SFR did not work for you but just generically not lab testing you, he suggested that Z3 block progressions should be a good option.  Then I double checked but we did not add any Z3 block progressions yet\u2026 Let me know if this is something that appeals to you and we could get those added.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Oh you are not running now, that likely lowers your risk of over training. i think your previous strategy of only easy running was a good one.  Was your injury related to training? I suggest everyone should try a pure low hr period, long enough to fully understand it. You can read Mark Allen\u2019s results with Maffetone\u2019s coaching. Solved his over training issues and made him faster. My thinking is ultimately that might be best for you.</p>\n<p>Also zone 3 or tempo blocks are not so popular but just a reduced stress model to sweet spot thinking.  Your case is a rather complex one. Multi sport and being so strong.  Compared to the rest of you your aerobic engine is weak.  Zone 2 and lots of hours is most predictable. Not sure if you have done much rucking but I find that as an interesting low impact alternative to running.</p>\n<p>Interesting reading by is the book building the elite.  It\u2019s military focused but I have talked to one of the authors and he is big zone 2 guy and training expert. They also do affordable coaching.</p>",

Going through treatment and it is improving.</p>\n<p>Last year I really committed to Zone 2 running.
