In any case, I tried HR mode out of curiosity yesterday and can\u2019t understand what it does. I assumed it would revert to Level Mode, but it doesn\u2019t seem to. At least, I didn\u2019t see any level options, and though my Wahoo defaults to Level 2 when not connected to an app, TD seemed to make it level \u201c0\u201d which was essentially freewheeling.</p>\n<p>Further, I noted that when I selected HR Mode, Erg mode remained selected, so when I unselected Erg, it went to this freewheel resistance I mentioned. So what would HR Mode PLUS Erg mode be doing?</p>\n<p>Sorry if this is an absurd question.</p>",

HR mode was desided for people with dumb trainers and no power meter so they could see an approximately similar workout, or could design workouts with specific HR targets and follow them and see more of an HR centric view.  I assumed smart trainer users could use it the same way or at least just pay more attention to HR this way.  What we plan on doing is enancing it for smart trainers so that when you are in HR mode and it has a target HR, then it adjusts your power automatically to keep you at that HR zone but we have not gotten that done yet.</p>\n<p>So yes for now what would make sense to me for most smart trainer users is to use HR and switch off ERG and control it yourself.</p>\n<p>Does that help?

IMHO is a little less useful training by heart rate in higher zones, where power-based training has an overwhelming advantage.<br>\nWhile maintaining the set level should not be difficult, it takes some time to gradually reach the set heart rate, especially since the heart rate as a response to the load will always be delayed (approx. 20 - 30 seconds).<br>\nYou might think of a combination of power and heart rate based training that is very useful for polarized training.

When you click on quick start you will have another option for HR, and you just use + - to set your target HR.  You can either use our auto extend featue so you don\u2019t worry about the length or change +30s to +5m and press it a few times to get your desired length.

      "cooked": "<p>That would most suddenly work for me to give it a go.<br>\nJust a mathematical reaction : the 5% might be a bit of a big gap.  If you\u2019re in my age group, it would work to do zone2 training.  But if you\u2019re younger and you zone 2 HR is still around 150, the 5% becomes a quite large gap.  No idea about the development effort, but putting it at 5 BPM + or - would probably me more realistic for a training session.<br>\nAnd a question : in what time interval would you measure these boundaries?  I did some reading on this yesterday and the time interval seems to be the \u201cfeature killer\u201d.  Trying to explain : imagine you put 129.  Do you adjust the power down the second you go above 135 ?  And then if it drops again, when do your adjust it down?  The most logic scenario I found described is to work with a time interval you can use as an input parameter and use the average HR over that interval (to compensate for the HR lagging and variability due to stuff like cycling body position,\u2026).  So, imagine you put it at 30s : you calculate the average HR of the last 30s, if it\u2019s above or below the treshold, you adjust the power.  Wait another 30s, same calculation.  and the 30s is a variable since depending on your training status or the type of training you want to do, you want to change this number up or down.<br>\nLet me know if this is clear.  Just a quick write down, happy to document it properly if you want!

      "cooked": "<p>Wow great!!! I would love to have help designing this, especially with someone that is passionate about the end solution.</p>\n<p>5% was actually just a simplified example, I had not fully designed it, and you are right 5 bpm sounds better.</p>\n<p>If I am understanding you correctly then it was pretty close to my thinking, meaning take last 30s average.  I am not 100% understanding what you mean though and would love to further understand.  You gave me a thought here is that people that have very fast heart rate recovery should have a shorter interval than people that have slow heart rate recovery at least when you are trying to lower the power to get in range.  Probably using some real examples of numbers of HR amounts and power adjustments might help.  After I get back from vacation next week I would even be more than happy to discuss this on a call.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it would seem like it would be optimum if we looked at trend lines in some way.  Meaning is it trending up in the last 30 seconds and maybe make a larger compensation down in power then if it is flat for the last 30 seconds.  Also when a person makes a change with + - the initial power target should probably be set based on the power to HR conversion ratios we have in our settings.  See below.</p>\n<p>So this is HR based is obviously best use for zone 2 and secondly zone 3 and 4.  And really we recommend people doing middle of the zone rather than the top if they want to stay in HR zone.</p>\n<p>I also know how hard power match is to get right (I believe we have it reasonable for longer intervals) and I feel HR match is like power match on steroids <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">   One of the reasons I did not want to introduce interval HR training yet, is I think people will complain it is wrong trying to do VO2max intervals or something <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/0/00a7b9c52c537cdecb6d3ad9a7f84e1baf5ac4d2.png\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/00a7b9c52c537cdecb6d3ad9a7f84e1baf5ac4d2\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/00a7b9c52c537cdecb6d3ad9a7f84e1baf5ac4d2_2_690x471.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"5NlJCXd4EMwX6TTCskmyBlTII2\" width=\"690\" height=\"471\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/00a7b9c52c537cdecb6d3ad9a7f84e1baf5ac4d2_2_690x471.png, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/00a7b9c52c537cdecb6d3ad9a7f84e1baf5ac4d2_2_1035x706.png 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/00a7b9c52c537cdecb6d3ad9a7f84e1baf5ac4d2_2_1380x942.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/00a7b9c52c537cdecb6d3ad9a7f84e1baf5ac4d2_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">1940\u00d71326 281 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",

If you start a new quick start workout, it starts at 40% of FTP as initial power and slowly rises until you hit your target.  In this version below my target is 60% of Threshold HR, which obviously is different then 60% of max HR.  As as said this is kind of V1 as a starting point and we can build from there.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/original/2X/4/42b47a81620fe5809d39d5860eee8dd27fe45af3.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/42b47a81620fe5809d39d5860eee8dd27fe45af3\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/42b47a81620fe5809d39d5860eee8dd27fe45af3_2_344x500.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"9w6bz1Czmdkv6vow6dLBJBBJKdd\" width=\"344\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/42b47a81620fe5809d39d5860eee8dd27fe45af3_2_344x500.jpeg, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/42b47a81620fe5809d39d5860eee8dd27fe45af3_2_516x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/42b47a81620fe5809d39d5860eee8dd27fe45af3_2_688x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/42b47a81620fe5809d39d5860eee8dd27fe45af3_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">996\u00d71444 87.2 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",
