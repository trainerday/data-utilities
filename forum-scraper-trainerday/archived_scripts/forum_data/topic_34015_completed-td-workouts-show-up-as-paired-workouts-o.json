Is that a problem? Should only one be connected? I do some outdoor rides which get uploaded to Strava from my Wahoo computer, as well as some spin class which use Stages bikes and software which I have connected to Strava so they show up as well. I\u2019d like to make sure these 3 different sources (TD, Wahoo, Stages) get propagated to Strava, TD, and Intervals, and thus far I have not ever had duplicate entries in Strava.</p>\n<p>My workflow has been that I take a Coach Jack plan (not pegged to a start date) and then Share a week or 2 at a time to Intervals. Then I often shift the workouts a day here or there based on when I can actually do the workout. Using the app, I go to Workouts tab (I have WOD connected to Intervals) and select the first item there (typically the one for \u201ctoday\u201d), do the workout, then Save and mark as completed. I then see my TD workout appear in Intervals and Strava, however it doesn\u2019t seem to get removed from the WOD/Workouts page.</p>",
