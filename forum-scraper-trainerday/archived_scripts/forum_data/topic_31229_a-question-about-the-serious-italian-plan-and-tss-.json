      "cooked": "<p>So, we have a fundamentally very different approach than TrainerRoad for example, they are all about maximizing TSS (fitness) + sweet spot.  I would say science has proven and most top coaches agree this is not the smartest or most effective way to get faster.   I am not saying it does not work, and it can work well for some people especially for short term gains, but for sure it has very little relationship to \u201ceffectiveness.\u201d    Cycling performance is more about duration than it is intensity and TSS focused plans tend to put a high emphasis on sustained intensity.  Very few elites or pros train this way and no science has proven that increased sustained intensity is better than increased amounts of \u201ceasy\u201d  i.e.  polarized as an example.</p>\n<p>There is useful information in TSS and the opposite correlation is true, usually when you are at your best you would be at your highest fitness/ctl/avg tss/week.  That is because this is usually when you have been riding the most not because you have been doing the most intensity.  TSS is also good for just making sure you are not increasing stress too quickly (TSB).</p>\n<p>I followed the TSS / high CTL (fitness) model and I can say this can be fun, and fun is good.  Not always the best or the smartest but I am a strong believer in fun.   If you want to have a high CTL in Coach Jack then increase the intensity and the ride feel and it will be a much more intense plan.</p>",

But I got no real training goal i.e. a long distance race. Now I want to get more endurance for longer rides (&gt;100km), so I can put 180 Watts (for me: Z2) on the pedal even after riding 100km or also get into the tempo zone (Z3) for 10-15 minutes without getting sour or feeling too exhausted.<br>\nFor the next two weeks I\u2019ll keep the moderate intensity of CJs training plan.

      "cooked": "<p>CTL  (Chronic Training Load) = Fitness score in intervals.  TrainingPeaks owns the terms  TSS/CTL/TSB so intervals does not use them (we don\u2019t either but we could because we are partners with them).  CTL is the more universally recognized term for Fitness Score.  And you can search google for these terms and get more information.</p>\n<p>TSB is Training Stress Balance.  I don\u2019t know what Intervals calls it.  Basically if you go negative for too long with your TSB you are wearing your body down and you get sick, injured, start sleeping poorly.  TSB (like all these numbers) are not totally accurate, meaning some people could be -30 for a few days and have issues another others might be able to sustain -30 for 10 days for example.  If you are really trying to maximize your \u201cfitness\u201d or CTL, you need to find your own limits for TSB.</p>\n<p>So when you increase your weekly average TSS too quickly, then your TSB gets out of whack (goes too negative). \u201cToo much, too soon.\u201d  Meaning you are taking risks.  Too much intensity too soon usually has more risk than too much duration too soon, but both have risks.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>What i meant was, that a fitness score doesn\u2019t tell you anything about your FTP. The fitness value (CTL) is always relative to your FTP. The TSS results from the intensity factor. If would ride for an hour at your FTP (e.g. 300w), this is 100 TSS, if your FTP increases to 330w, and you ride for an hour at this new FTP, this is still 100 TSS. This means that a higher CTL is only possible by increasing the training volume or the intensity of the training relative to your FTP.<br>\nHowever, the TSS or CTL doesn\u2019t show that your FTP is increasing. And at some point, an increase in volume and intensity is no longer possible. So the fitness value can\u2019t increase forever.<br>\nThe CTL can certainly be used to plan your season and you can slowly increase it until summer or your target event. For a possible training volume of 6 hours, a target value of 40 (TSS 290) is recommended. For 8 hours it is 55 (TSS 390), for 10 hours it is 70 (TSS 490) and for 15 hours it is 105 (TSS 740). I have these recommendations from Training peaks Help Center.<br>\nBut it should be noted that not all TSS are the same. To increase the weekly TSS by 100, you can ride an additional 2.5 hours at 64% FTP, 1.5 hours at 80% FTP, 1 hour at 100% FTP or 26 minutes at 150% FTP, or 1 minute at 770% FTP. As you can see there are different ways to increase TSS (and therefore CTL), but each has a different effect, some are even impossible, but all reflect the same value.<br>\nAnd another problem is that the stress of everyday life is not factored into the equation.</p>\n<p>So yes and no. It says nothing about how fit you really are. But if you know what it means, you can use it to become fitter.</p>\n<p>Here is how I will do it. I slowly increase my hours of indoor training, to my maximum hours what is possible indoors. Then I add some intensity. In spring I will increase the hours even more, because riding outside for longer is for most easier. I then increase some intensity again. That helps to increase the fitness value slowly until summer and some gran fondos. The fitness value will reflect what I feel. In fall i reduce the hours, and the fitness value will decrease again. But that\u2019s ok, because I want to reach my target in next summer again and not in winter.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Yeah, that\u2019s true too. There are studies which show that your aerobic and anaerobic threshold will move downwards with higher fatigue during an exercise, especially if you do high intensity stuff. So for example you do a sweetspot interval in the first hour, and then you do the same power in the second or third hour, it maybe becomes a threshold interval. The calculated training stress is the same for those parts, but it\u2019s not the same stress for your body, yes.</p>",

You can even make workouts that feel moderate, and another one of the same TSS that is impossible.   40 minutes of 105%  vs 8x5 at 105%\u2026 both with the same duration of rests.
