      "cooked": "<p>so my wife has been using Trainerday for a while and has recently been complaining that the signal on the SB20 drops sometimes during her workout, forcing her to unplug/reconnect the bike to get going again. I\u2019ve been dismissing her concerns but this week actually joined TD and had my first ride today and\u2026 signal dropout.</p>\n<p>Some facts: bike itself is paired to TD as controllable and power and a HR monitor is paired as well. Running the app on M1 iPad Pro with the latest version of iOS (15.6 i believe). TD app is updated to latest version. As usual, before every workout I calibrate the PMs on the SB20 with the Stages app and then force close the app before starting my workout. I\u2019m coming from Trainerroad and have used that pretty extensively over the past 2 years with zero signal dropouts. Also use Rouvy and have had zero signal dropouts with that platform, so I\u2019m fairly convinced it\u2019s a Trainerday issue.</p>\n<p>My issue happened maybe 3/4 of the way through the workout after a 250 or so watt segment that then dropped to a planned 84 or so watts. I noticed that the power during the 84w segment was rather high (still 250w or so) so I slowed rpms down and that\u2019s when i noticed that the \u201c2\u201d box in the top right corner for # of connected devices now was showing \u201c1\u201d. I was able to go there and see that only the HR was connected, not the bike. Unpaired and repaired the SB20 bike (again, not the l/r cranks) and after a couple of seconds was back in business. I\u2019m sure my wife could do the same thing rather than getting off to unplug, but she\u2019s not as familiar with how any of this works.</p>\n<p>Anyway, happy to share any additional details as needed but I\u2019d love to have this resolved. Cannot have signal dropouts from my first ride on the platform after literally none on any of the other platforms for a far longer length of use\u2026</p>\n<p>UPDATE: and again it happened today. zero resistance in the middle of the session, just sitting there spinning the cranks with nothing registering for a good 2 min. beginning to think this app is\u2026not good. Used m1 ipad pro today and iphone 11 yesterday. next time i\u2019ll try android via samsung s21 ultra. all i know is that this dropout thing ONLY happens in TD app. no issue with Trainer Road, Rouvy or Zwift for 2.5 years\u2026</p>",

I know people have have a few issues at times but seemed to get them resolved.  Please let me know if you expertience this with Android.  If you do and are willing to work with my developer it\u2019s very easy for us to find and resolve issues on Android.  If not we can also try and debug on iOS device as well, just not as convienient.  We would love to get this fixed as usually improving one device can help with others.  Do you have a link to the specific workout you were doing?  Some times workouts with ramps (as compared to steps) can cause issues on some devices.</p>",

We have tackled about 95% (that I know of).  This is one of the few device issues remaining, although many apps only send updates every 5-seconds and we send every 1 second on a ramp and this can cause some devices issues.   A kickr Snap and workout with ramps for example.</p>",
