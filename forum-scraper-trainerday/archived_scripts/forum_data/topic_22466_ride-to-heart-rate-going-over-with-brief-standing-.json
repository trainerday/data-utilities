In your article \u201cThe Ultimate Way - Zone 2 Training\u201d  you refer to \u201cZone 2 - Heart Rate Test\u201d and \u201cMaximum - Heart Rate Test\u201d\u2026    Both of these workouts do the exact same thing - Hit HR button  and I get the cue to switch to heart rate mode.    And I am back to 1 hour \u201cWarm Up\u201d.    Just to be clear\u2026  Are you saying these workouts do not work yet and  the only workout that functions is the 1 hour \u201cWarm Up\u201d\u2026  and the article is a little premature\u2026</p>",

Also, I was curious on the max heart rate test.   But, my reason for posting was that I thought I had a problem since every time I hit HR mode I was taken to \u201cWarm Up.\u201d   Maybe a month ago this did not happen, although I was not using HR as a metric.     I am pleased with TrainerDay, so this post is not a complaint.   Just like things to work as described.   I will look forward to the HR updates\u2026</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi great feedback.  We will start allowing people to create the HR length workouts they want, which will improve it even farther.</p>\n<p>From my perspective the <span class=\"hashtag\">#1</span> reason to use HR mode is to stay in a primarily fat burning state which is as you point out is also good for recovery or at least not digging the hole any deeper.</p>\n<p>I am not sure that any experts are 100% clear on exactly what mechanisms cause us to switch from predominantly fat burn to predominantly glycogen burn other than need for faster energy.  Scientist frequently like to explain things that are their theory rather than proven.  Maybe it\u2019s proven but I have not seen it.  Anyway, it is very testable and proven as we increase intensity we switch from fat burn to glycogen burn, and that speeds up more rapidly after our LT1/AeT.   Now the big question is is this change caused by aerobic changes or lactate related changes?  That is the part I don\u2019t think is 100% clear.  So as HR goes up their is likely an increased need for oxygen to our muscles.</p>\n<p>Sorry that is a long story to the point which is Maffetone clearly states that his belief is when your body feels you are doing something beyond normal function, something that it feels like it needs extra energy then it says \u201chey quick, we need energy let\u2019s burn carbs/glycogen.\u201d  So tricking your body into thinking it is not doing anything is part of the \"science\u2019 behind this.</p>\n<p>So it\u2019s possible by standing and going over your AeT HR, then even though it may not be additional fatigue it could cause an shift to more glycogen burning state.  Maffetone suggests when you start burning more glycogen it\u2019s hard for your body to get back to that predominately fat burning state.</p>\n<p>So our HR design is based on these theories, which are not predicting fatigue levels but are actually just trying to control HR with the associated benefits.</p>\n<p>If you believe and trust all the mumbo / jumbo I stated above and plan to be standing, and you are riding at your theoretical AeT limit, it might make sense to drop your HR target by 5bpm to keep under even while standing.</p>\n<p>Your idea is very valid and depending on someones goals might totally make sense but since their is no concrete information about all this stuff it is hard to say.  I think in almost all cases standing equates to a lower cadence so if we saw a lower cadence with HR spike then we could assume someone is standing.  I am never apposed to collecting other ideas on how to improve this to make it better.</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Hi Alex.  Thanks for the reply.   I must say that maybe I didn\u2019t make clear enough what I was experiencing based on your reply.   I was never anywhere near LT2 or Maximum Aerobic Heart Rate.    I was simply standing for a few seconds to stretch, and I noticed that if my heart rate exceeded my set point by 6 beats the power setting would drop.   Consequently, my heart rate would drop by 10 beats due to the power drop.   This is expected.  But I guess my issue is the program seems to react quickly to drop the power but takes a lot longer to get back.   I would override the wait by adjusting my heart rate set point to get the power back to where I want it more quickly.     On a side note.   I worked in Engineering or 25 years.   I had a manger tell me that e-mail was better communication tool than face to face talking.   He was full of crap.   Because if we could talk face to face and I could demonstrate what I am trying to convey the understanding would be clear.   But with all that I like the effort you guys are making and the App is the best value out there.</p>",

I have the exact same effect as you, and even more extreme, all I have to do is take my hands off the bar and my HR goes up.  I can only guess there is zero additional fatigue from taking my hands off the bar.  I also was saying Maffetone suggest for some people even going slightly above LT1 (not LT2) can drive them into an a lowered state of fat burning and be difficult to get back there.  In his experience this is some people not all people, so I know it seems hard to believe but just standing for a bit and going above could cause this.  My guess is the more healthy you are the less this effect has but according to Maffetone there is no harm in playing it safe.</p>\n<p>I would say this is very unproven science and semi-controversial, but for me reading his literature, he has empirically tested this \u201cfat burning zone\u201d hr, zone 2, low hr, whatever we want to call it more than anyone else on the planet <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>So from my perspective it\u2019s good to give him the benefit of the doubt.  He also claims being 10 beats below this AeT cut off point provides just as much benefit in most people as being at the limit.  So if all this is true, you would be be better off dropping your HR limit by 5 beats or so and just accepting when you hit this raised limit while standing that it\u2019s ok to generally be a bit lower.   Or in general accept that this HR limit is a range not a target.   The range is usually between -10 and +5 of this limit.</p>\n<p>Trying to predict someone standing or taking hands off the bar might be possible but it seems it is likely to be very error prone so a little scary for me.  Right now at least we need to stabilize what we have.  Some people want fast warmup and some want slow.  This is more of a standard request in my opinion.</p>\n<p>Make any more sense?  Or do we still need this call? <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>Thanks, yes our goal is to always be the best value and keep our prices the lowest forever.  If we just keep improving and not increase our prices we should be able to easily dominate this space if we don\u2019t already.</p>",
