For the pros, it makes the difference between winning and being dropped.  For us mere mortals, it makes the difference doing Gran Fondos that end with a big climb\u2026</p>\n<p>Now the \u201csimple\u201d advice is : go out and ride 3 hours each day in Z2, complimented with some other harder stuff.  Which is pretty much the summary of a modern pro rider training schedule.  For which most of us don\u2019t have the time\u2026</p>\n<p>What are \u201cbest practices\u201d if you have 1-1h30 during weekdays (most of if indoors) and longer rides in the weekend?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m experimenting a bit\u2026  Instead of doing 4 HIIT intervals after eachother, I\u2019m doing 20 min of easy warmup, 2 HITT interval blocks, 45 minutes of Z2, then another 2 intervals and then cooldown.  I also tried to do 60 min of Z2 first and then 4 interval blocks but euh\u2026 that was funny\u2026  didn\u2019t really work out.  Which shows exactly the concept of durability, because I can do these 4 interval 'fresh\" \u2026</p>\n<p>Any suggestions ?</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>Good question.  I think the term is new enough that I am not sure it is fully agreed upon (or maybe it is) but I see it more as the idea to be able to handle your goal/duration intensities without falling apart\u2026 Meaning if your goal is Gran Fondo\u2019s you should build durability that supports that.  Which generally means lower tempo durability for most people.  If you plan on keeping in the draft and you know there will be climbs that you might struggle to hold on, it might be durability of those climbs.  I see HIIT as mostly the opposite of durability.  I also see the logical progression of longer and longer intervals as the smartest way to increase durability.  So what stops you from reaching your goals.  Mental durability, (don\u2019t like suffering) well maybe practice some suffering <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>So I see this more as a new buzz word closely related to specificity although I like it, it brings out clarity.  Let\u2019s say you believe you can do a normalized power of 150w for a 7 hour gran fondo but it will be very hard\u2026 My believe is doing lots of 2 hour 130-140w rides could get you there without too much suffering.  Instead of trying to do shorter intervals of 180w\u2026 Although depending on your personal weakness in durability it\u2019s hard to say what is optimum for you.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know if this is all the most efficient training but to me it encompasses \u201cdurability.\u201d Which I would prioritize duration over increased intensity.</p>",

Progressively more/longer intervals. That\u2019s more specific to the Gran-Fondo goal.<br>\nIf you have doubts on \u2018durability\u2019, there\u2019s very little chance that you\u2019re going to do an end-sprint or VO2mx attack, right?<br>\nFocus on what you will do and what will allow you to get to the end in a satisfactory way. Temp/SS improvements might make the difference to being able to hold on in a group on a climb so that after the climb you can tuck in again on the flats and recover. Being dropped on a climb, often means that you\u2019re on your own to fight the wind when back on the flats. and that can mean a long and very hard day\u2026</p>",

      "cooked": "<p>We have been great at ice skating\u2014so great that some of us took on another Nationality so they could still compete at the Olympics, WCs, ECs, etc. It is really annoying for us when someone else wins.</p>\n<p>But a few years ago, there was Nils van der Poel. He came, he trained, and he was victorious. After an Olympic gold medal, he disappeared as quickly as he came. But he left us his training diary for the Olympics, called How to Win the Olympic 10K (the audacity).</p>\n<p>His training schedule was straightforward. To win the 10k, he needed to skate rounds of 28 seconds, and that was all he did. Skate rounds doing 28 secs. He mixed that win zone 2 200-watt bike workouts.</p>\n<p>Durability is the counterpart to FTP. For years, young pros were recruited for their high FTPs. But world tour riders don\u2019t just need a high FTP, and many of these young guys failed, mainly because they lacked durability. Meaning, they were strong, but the longer the ride, the weaker they would get.</p>\n<p>I always analyse the goal with the cyclist. Where is he most likely to get into trouble, or where can he make a difference?<br>\nThat is the specificity I\u2019ll build his training around. Often, a big, long climb has a small part that is so steep that it will drive you to zone 5 or 6. If you are not prepared, you will burn yourself and make the rest of the climb very tough. So even a big climb can need Zone 5 or 6 training. Belgium classics are all about short, intense efforts.</p>\n<p>Gran Fondo Les Trois Ballons ends at La Planche des Belles Filles, where even the pros need to get out of the saddle to drag themselves over the finish line.</p>\n<p>I think what Alex says is very important. If you are training for a Grand Fondo, you\u2019ll need to ride long hours. I recommend at least 80% of your expected finish time.</p>",

(yes, it\u2019s the famous climb where even Pogi bunked a couple of years ago).  you are above 2000m and while the first 20k of the climb is \u201conly\u201d around 8%, you suddenly get parts of 20%.

Now I\u2019m doing a warmup, some SST (let\u2019s say 15-20 minutes), then 30-45 minutes zone 2, and then another block of SST.   in the past I would have done the 2 blocks of SST with let\u2019s say 5 minutes in between.  I\u2019m spreading it out now.  The least I can say is that after \u201cjust\u201d 45 minutes of Z2 indoors, the second interval is \u201cinteresting\u201d <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",
