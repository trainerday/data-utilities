After my free premium period ended, I only use TR for creating and downloading workouts to my Garmin 530.</p>\n<p>Joined also Strava last year, but only for logging, and I\u2019m not interested comparing me with others or setting any speed records.</p>\n<p>I bought a smart trainer some months ago and joined Kinomap. It\u2019s a nice application where you can cycle in different environments. But if you are interested of structured plans/workouts, It\u2019s not so good.</p>\n<p>After Kinomap I tested was Sufferfest. It\u2019s a nice app but I didn\u2019t like their plans with 4-5 workouts a week (century plan). It\u2019s too much for me. I rather do not more then 3, because I also do strength training twice a week.</p>\n<p>So I switched application again. Now to TrainerRoad, which I\u2019m still using and doing their low volume SS-plan. My plan is/was to continue with TR until my outdoor season starts in april, and then create my own plans.</p>\n<p>And then I found some weeks ago TrainerDay. And I can\u2019t make my mind up I if shall abandon TR and get a premium account here or not. The monthly fee is lower, but that\u2019s not important for me. I have read all information on the website about all features of TD.</p>\n<p>As I said, when my outdoor season starts, I probably will create my own workouts. And I\u2019m not sure if TD will help me with this so much.</p>",

If  you want to change workouts often and potentially create something and ride it instantly ours is better.  Ours let\u2019s you start a warmup and switch to another workout based on how you feel and if you are watching a movie and just want it to auto extend it does\u2026</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t care about price and really want to follow a calendar based plan then TR is probably the better option.  TR is much more mature and has a lot of small things that likely make it better for some people.  Our focus is the self-coached athlete and theirs is more towards the follow our plan route but you can still do what you want on TR.  Really you can\u2019t go wrong with either.  My style of riding fits TD better but TR is great and inspired us to build what we have.</p>",

My personal favourite here is BigRingVR, but Rouvy or VeloReality are also good for \u2018real world\u2019 footage.</p>\n<p>Obviously, Tacx TDA also, but that\u2019s probably the more expensive option and it may be cumbersome to run. They on ly offer monthly or yearly plans, I think.</p>",
