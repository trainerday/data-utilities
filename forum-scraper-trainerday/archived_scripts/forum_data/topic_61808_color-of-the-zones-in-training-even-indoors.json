I think it could be useful for both users and coaches.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much<br>\nGabriele</p>",

I have taken the TrainerRoad approach to this thinking as I really think they did it right <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">   Some times there is the \u201cright way\u201d and some times their is the way most/many users want\u2026 <img src=\"https://forums.trainerday.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>The reason I avoid this is because to me, many others and the TrainerRoad crew, this paints a inaccurate picture.  There is arguably (?) no difference between a workout performed at 75% or 76% of FTP, yet showing them as 2 different colors would make it seem like their is a big difference.</p>\n<p>With ERG mode this becomes even more true because it can hold you to a very consistent level of power. So I think Zones are great from a conversational perspective I think they are poor from a choosing/analyzing a workout perspective when you are talking about strict power numbers.  Now I feel a bit differently in HR because it\u2019s inherently in less strict and when we push workouts to Garmin for example with push the whole zone which gives  you a wide range that you are likely to target the difference.</p>\n<p>Again this comes potentially down to a flaw in my and some others thinking that can\u2019t let go of this power target / zone problem.    I think most \u201cexperts\u201d would agree more than 3 zones is inherently a construct that has no physiological relevance but I still believe a 5-7 zone model is excellent for conversations and represents the nature of our intensities\u2026</p>\n<p>Sorry\u2026 not sure this helps.
