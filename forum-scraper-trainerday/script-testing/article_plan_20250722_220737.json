When TrainerDay sends a target like 137 W, the bike just rounds it internally",
        "answer": "Interesting.  What bike is that?  Also, if we smooth to 5w then it would be the same as your bike smoothing to 5w, so stop manually adjusting and it would be the same workout right (for your body)? Just visually it would match.  Just making sure I understand.",

When TrainerDay sends a target like 137 W, the bike just rounds it internally, which can lead to inconsistent resistance and makes workouts feel a bit off. For example, even when the app sends 139 W, the bike still holds at 135 W \u2013 only once the app reaches 140 W does the trainer adjust to that level. I know this seems like a small detail, but it adds up over time.\nSome types of workouts make this even more difficult \u2013 especially those with gradual power ramps that increase by 1 watt every few seconds. Since my bike can only accept steps of 5 W, it doesn\u2019t follow those small changes correctly, and I have to manually adjust the resistance on the bike just to stay close to the intended target. This breaks focus and takes away from the training experience.\nWould it be possible to add an option in the settings or when building workouts that automatically rounds all power targets to the nearest supported value, based on a user-defined minimum and step (e.g. 25 W min, 5 W step)? Alternatively, this could happen dynamically during workout execution if TrainerDay detects the trainer\u2019s limitations.\nIt wouldn\u2019t affect users with full ERG resolution, but for people like me it would greatly improve consistency and experience.\nThanks for considering it!",

You could do the same thing all year long and meet those goals.  To improve performance then following a plan that increases volume over time, say has 6 months or a longer duration with different blocks and intensities (periodization) and gives you variety during the build and peak phases.  If you don\u2019t want all this and just want simple and it sounds like you are healthy and not injured I would just do the serious italian for 16 weeks.  It gives the widest variety and is my favorite block.  But again if you love hard training then you could choose something harder or increase the starting intensity.  I suggest starting at intensity 1 but that depends on what is fun for you.  It won\u2019t feel hard in the beginning but will be moderately hard by the end.  Start with an FTP ramp test so you know your FTP\u2026\nFor some people just doing zone 2 indoors with our HR+ feature and watching TV and doing something easy is a great plan and save the harder efforts for outdoor.  Yearly consistency is much more important than the actual plan.",

You are not alone, a significant # of people feel like they are getting no benefit if they are not working a bit.  The funny thing this is fairly far from the truth.\nYou have this concept that drives Zone 2 which is called \u201cFatMax\u201d which means the point at which you burn the maximum amount of fat.  You can get lab tested to find this point but this aligns with the same idea as zone 2 and in your case probably falls between 65-75% of max HR which is very easy feeling.  One way I have seen significant aerobic gains is by doing this intensity (really 60-65% of max HR at that time) 7 days a week for 30-60 minutes, usually closer to 30 but for sure you would get more from 60.\nYou could do this for 6 months and only this.  The problem is if it is not fun, you don\u2019t enjoy it and that causes you to be inconsistent or stop then it defeats the whole purpose.  I think having fun is important.  Overall just keep doing anything as much as you can and over time your RHR should go down and automatically with this your HRV will go up.  zone 2 is just the most efficient way to do this, but zone 3 or even a bit of interval training will still cause these adaptions it just takes longer but if it is more fun, I would seriously consider the fun factor.  As your RHR goes down, your power goes up, it actually gets easier and easier.   Pro cyclists will tell you zone 2 is not easy and after a long upper zone 2 interval then need a rest.\nSo you have to decide what is more important (fun with some intensity) or maximum efficiency to improving your aerobic base.  So 6 days a week with zone 2 and one HIIT day per week is likely the fastest way to improve your aerobic function.\nYou feel a lot stronger with some regular intensity is another motivational benefit.  Once you answer the above question I can help you pick a plan.",

There is arguably (?) no difference between a workout performed at 75% or 76% of FTP, yet showing them as 2 different colors would make it seem like their is a big difference.\nWith ERG mode this becomes even more true because it can hold you to a very consistent level of power. So I think Zones are great from a conversational perspective I think they are poor from a choosing/analyzing a workout perspective when you are talking about strict power numbers.  Now I feel a bit differently in HR because it\u2019s inherently in less strict and when we push workouts to Garmin for example with push the whole zone which gives  you a wide range that you are likely to target the difference.\nAgain this comes potentially down to a flaw in my and some others thinking that can\u2019t let go of this power target / zone problem.    I think most \u201cexperts\u201d would agree more than 3 zones is inherently a construct that has no physiological relevance but I still believe a 5-7 zone model is excellent for conversations and represents the nature of our intensities\u2026\nSorry\u2026 not sure this helps.  Just something I am passionate about and wish someone would change my mind on this   Some how I think the colors look friendly and attractive to normal humans",
