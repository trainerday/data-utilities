    "full_text": "hello Alex from trainer day here we've got a new feature I'm going to show you on the download or send plans I'll click right here I'm looking at the send plan option this is a paid option if you want to send to training Peaks we've got we had that before but now we also have send to Garmin so you can send it to Garmin and it tells you what interval target type you have so I have like a power 1s or a one-second target and that's based on your settings we also H we can go to apps and devices and see those settings we've moved these settings here so now you see them so whatever default you have power 3 s power lap whatever you have that's what will be used in your training plans to when you send a Garmin anyway we'll go here I was on this one I think and I'll go ahead and click send plan again and the other option that we now have is either on both Garmin and on training Peaks you can send specific weeks so if your schedules kind of dynamic and you tend to not follow it calendar perfectly then if you send it like a 16 week calendar and you have to start shifting things around that's very painful so it's actually much easier to just say send one or two weeks at a time and then once you finish those then send the next weeks you know so then then it makes it easy you're only shifting a couple workouts around as things have to happen to move right so you can select these two weeks if you happen that you could also go find a plan that say a 12 week plan and say oh I like just two of those weeks or I like four of those weeks and so you can just send four of those weeks and just do four of those a week so this is a very nice feature and it's available both in the training peaks and the Garmin plan and that's it thank you very much",
